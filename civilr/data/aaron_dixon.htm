<p>Aaron Dixon was co-founder and Captain of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party. </p>

<p>Born in Chicago, he grew up in Seattle's Central District. His father worked at Boeing and both parents taught Aaron and his brothers the importance of fighting for social justice. As a college student at the University of Washington, Dixon played a key role in the formation of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the Seattle Chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) along with Larry Gossett and others. Through the BSU, Dixon also helped organize protests and black student unions at local high schools. In the spring of 1968, at the funeral of Bobby Hutton in Oakland, California, Dixon met Bobby Seale and later was appointed Captain of Seattleâ€™s Black Panther Party, the first chapter outside of Oakland. He was 19 years old. Dixon led the chapter through its first four years, then moved to Party national headquarters in Oakland in 1972. There he worked with Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, and served for a time as bodyguard to Elaine Brown. </p>
