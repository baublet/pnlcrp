	<h2>About the Labor and Civil Rights Projects</h2>
	
	<p>The Pacfic Northwest Labor and Civil Rights Projects are directed by Professor James N. Gregory at the University of Washington and supported by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, the Simpson Center for the Humanities, and the Center for the Study of Pacific Northwest. The twelve projects bring together more than one hundred video oral history interviews and several thousand photographs, documents, and digitized newspaper articles. Included are films, slide shows, and lesson plans for teachers. The projects also feature scores of historical essays about important issues, events, and people, many researched and written by undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Washington.Here is information about <a href="/labhist/staff.shtml">staff and contributors</a> and about <a href="/labhist/copyright.shtml">copyrights and citations</a>.</p>
