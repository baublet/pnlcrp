			<p>The Cold War  began in 1946 as the U.S. and the USSR  turned from reluctant allies into avowed enemies after the end of World War II. Worry about domestic Communists soon followed and Republicans capitalized on the issue in the November 1946 elections, winning control of Congress and in Washington State winning control of the legislature. Anti-communist legislation emerged from both bodies in 1947. Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act that banned Communists from holding union leadership position, President Harry Truman issued an executive order requiring loyalty oaths of all federal employees, and in Olympia the legislature passed a resolution authorizing a widespread investigation into communist activities in Washington State. The hearings that followed would make headlines across the nation, and other states would soon join </p>
			<p>Albert F. Canwell, newly elected Republican state representative from Spokane, introduced the successful bill and became chair of  of the Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities that began work in early 1948. The first set of hearings focused on the Washington Pension Union, an advocacy group that had won increased social security benefits for seniors and pensions for single mothers. In carefully orchestrated testimony, a parade of friendly witnesses claimed that the WPU served as a front-group for the Communist Party. </p>
			<p>Next, the committee took aim at the University of Washington, where one politician claimed there were over 100  Communists on the university faculty. Canwell initially planned to force forty faculty members to testify, but shortened his list to eleven before the July, 1948 hearings got underway. In the aftermath,six tenured faculty members would  face sanctions from the University and three would lose their jobs. </p>
			<p>The Canwell investigations had widespread effects. They changed the tone of political life in Washington State and launched an era of trouble for the Communist Party and for current and former members, many of whom would face harrassment, some losing  jobs, and a few going to jail. Attracting headlines around the country, the investigations inspired other state  legislatures and other universities  to follow the Washington example and begin to look for radicals in their schools, universities, and other institutions. </p>
