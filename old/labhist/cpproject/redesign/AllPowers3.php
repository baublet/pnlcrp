		 Mark Jenkin's play was published by University of Washington Press in 1989. Click to read the preface.</span>    In February 1998, fifty years after the notorious Canwell Committee hearings, Seattle once again watched Albert Canwell  hunt communists at the University of Washington, this time as part of a remarkable play written by Mark Jenkins. <em>All Powers Necessary and Convenient</em> took its title from the enabling legislation that created the Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. Produced by the UW School of Drama and featuring a cast of nearly 30 actors, the play used actual testimony to recreate the tense drama of accusation, intimidation, and courage that had unfolded a half century earlier. Large audiences filled the playhouse theater for each performance and attended the lectures and other public events that accompanied the play. And it was quickly apparent  that something unique was happening. <em>All Powers</em> had brought history to life at an important moment, helping several generations come to terms with an important episode in their collective past.</p>
  <p>Here is the story of the remarkable play that touched lives and reawakened history. Read the preface and see photos and other materials from the performance and associated events. Watch a short video about the play produced and broadcast on KCTS, and listen to audience reactions and survivor stories. </p>
