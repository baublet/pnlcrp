        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; text-indent: 50">If ever
        a political credo was vindicated by wider events, the stock market crash
        of October 1929 reinforced the CP USA’s goal to overturn the
        capitalist system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        Crash personified capitalism at its most obvious failing, and was, as
        well, Communism’s greatest chance to establish the case for a Marxist,
        worker-based economy and political system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>By raising the political consciousness of the disaffected and
        poverty-stricken unemployed, the Communists could foment the
        revolutionary overthrow of the capitalistic system. Or could they? Could
        Washington State, which had a relatively small population with a high
        degree of industrialization, be the place to instigate change?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">With its
        dependence on resource extraction, Washington experienced slowdowns when
        domestic and foreign export markets declined. By 1930, lumber production
        in Western Washington fell by more than 25% and coal mining declined by
        almost 12%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
        farming-dependent counties of Eastern Washington, wheat-price declines
        were matched by the falls in production and export.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Unemployment grew steadily. There are no adequate statistics but
        commentators estimated that there were between 40,000 and 55,000 out of
        work in Seattle by the spring of 1932 or at least 25 percent of the
        workforce. Unemployment was just as common in other cities and in the
        lumber areas of the state.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[i]</span></a></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">The
        response to the Depression from organized labor in Washington was
        initially muted. Workers in industries or firms not organized were among
        the first to lose their jobs but the cuts soon fell across all
        employment sectors. The first response from the leadership of the
        Washington State Federation of Labor was to blame immigration for rising
        joblessness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, by
        the time of the Federation’s annual convention in June, 1930, the
        organization had begun to see that the problems of unemployment,
        including financial help for the jobless and their families, were
        important topics deserving attention. Even so, labor leaders were ill
        equipped to tackle the issue. American Federation of Labor (AFL) unions
        in Washington had long regarded it an employer’s responsibility to
        provide relief to unemployed workers; unions tended to focus narrowly on
        safety, wages and workplace conditions rather than on the broader issues
        of social and economic conditions</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">Of
        course, Communists were not encumbered by a faith in any part of the
        existing economic system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
        years of trying to organize inside AFL unions (&quot;boring from
        within&quot;), the Comintern in 1928 had developed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>a new policy of building party-controlled unions. The Trade Union
        Unity League would be the Communist alternative to the AFL. When the
        Depression hit, the Party also developed an organizing strategy aimed at
        the unemployed. As part of a 13-point list of demands—which included
        unemployment insurance equal to full wages, a seven-hour day and
        recognition of the Soviet Union—the Communist Party called for the
        formation of Unemployed Councils. Every local and district office of the
        Trade Union Unity League was told to set up a council and instructions
        on how:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%; margin-left: 50"><font size="2">Into these
        Councils shall be drawn representatives of the revolutionary unions,
        shop committees and reformist unions, as well as unorganized workers.
        The councils shall be definitely affiliated to the respective TUUL.</font><a name="_ednref2" href="#_edn2"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[ii]</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:

        </span><font size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
        cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit, the Unemployed Councils made
        an immediate impact, staging large attention- getting demonstrations in
        the winter and spring of 1930 and in subsequent years building
        neighborhood based Councils that fought for public assistance and
        rallied neighbors to conduct rent strikes and resist evictions. But in
        the Northwest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>the Unemployed Councils were much less effective. Police
        repression was one of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>problems. The Seattle Police Department maintained a policy of
        permanent harassment all through the early years of the 1930s, arresting
        Communists whenever they tried to hold a street meeting or a
        demonstration, and routinely breaking up even in-door Party meetings.
        Dozens of Party activists spent time in jail for the simple act of
        trying to speak or attend a meeting. The usual charge was vagrancy, but
        prosecutors also went after leaders with Criminal Syndicalism charges,
        while those of foreign birth were threatened with deportation. The
        American Civil Liberties Union and the International Labor Defense (the
        CP legal team) managed to block most of the deportation orders affecting
        Washington state Communists, but in Oregon the still more zealous
        persecution of Reds resulted in some long prison terms and numerous
        deportations. The Finnish community of Astoria was particularly hard
        hit. The editors and staff of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Toveri</i>,
        a Communist linked Finnish language newspaper, were arrested<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>and deported.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[iii]</span></a><o:p>

        </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">By the summer of
        1931, the Unemployed Councils faced another obstacle, a rival
        organization, the Unemployed Citizens’ League, formed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>by socialists Hulet Wells and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span>Carl
        Branin, who directed the Seattle Labor College and published <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
        Vanguard</i>,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
        </span>a weekly newspaper. Wells and Branin set up the Unemployed
        Citizens’ League as a self-help organization that provided practical
        relief to destitute workers and their families. Within three months, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Vanguard</i> reported a meeting involving representatives of 20
        local UCLs from around Seattle. The organization was structured around
        neighborhood commissaries where food, firewood and clothing were
        dispensed. The self-help effort also included the operation of six shoe
        repair shops and the cultivation of 450 acres.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title><span style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[iv]</span></a>

        </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
        UCL quickly overshadowed the Unemployed Councils and within months had
        become a major social movement.</span> In addition to services provided
        directly by its own members, the UCL commissaries received aid from the
        city of Seattle, King County, and sympathetic businesses. Between January 1 and July 12, 1932, the UCL self-help effort
        in Seattle had provided relief to 79,935 men and wood to 63,886 men. The
        cumulative labor provided in these endeavors and in the clerical effort
        necessary to run the commissaries was 2,306,415 hours of labor,
        according to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Arthur Hillman
        who studied the organization in 1932.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[v]</span></a></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">Communists
        were quick to attack the rival organization. Herbert Benjamin, a
        national CP leader of the Unemployed Councils, labeled<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>the UCL a “social fascist” effort that would lead to betrayal
        of the workers and urged Seattle<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Communist
        Party officials to build the Unemployed Councils.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.0in; line-height: 110%; margin-left: 50"><font size="2">Usually
        the plans of rival organizations are not aimed to make our struggle more
        effective, but on the contrary, to weaken our struggle and resistance to
        the hunger policy of the bosses. Those who sponsor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">such
        rival organizations do so for the personal and political advantages
        which they gain by this means. Most of such organizations base
        themselves on a so-called ‘self-help’ program. That is, instead of
        struggle to force the bosses and government, who control the wealth, to
        provide adequate relief and unemployment insurance, they advocate that
        we, workers, shall help each other by sharing our poverty.</span></font><a style="mso-endnote-id:

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">While the
        CP-backed Unemployed Councils offered a hopeful future of jobs, respect
        and benefits in a classless society, they did not match the concrete
        offerings of firewood and sustenance that the UCL commissaries were
        providing free of monetary charge. Given the choice, it appeared that
        most Seattle unemployed preferred the immediate relief attained through
        wood and food than some vague promise of salvation through Marxism.
        Besides, Wells and Branin, both experienced in labor issues, also worked
        on a political agenda to get bills through the Legislature that would
        provide unemployment insurance, a jobs program and cash relief.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>A similar situation occurred in Bellingham, where a small coterie
        belonging to the Communist Party (seven in number, according to Eugene
        Dennett) soon found their efforts upstaged by an organization called the
        People’s Councils, formed by Bellingham activist M.M. London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Similar to the Unemployed Citizens League, the People's Councils
        quickly coalesced into a strong movement that held mass meetings, staged
        demonstrations and resisted evictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Elsewhere in the state, the ranks of the unemployed joined UCL
        locals or the United Producers of Washington., an affiliated
        organization.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

        </span>Tensions erupted between Communists and these socialist
        organizations when various groups representing the unemployed embarked
        on a march to the State capitol in Olympia on July 4, 1932.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The goal was a show of support intended to change the mind of
        Governor Roland Hartley, a traditional, pro-business Republican, who had
        steadfastly denied state funds for workers’ relief efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Hartley refused to meet the demonstrators, though he did meet a
        smaller delegation, including Hulet Wells, two days later. Despite the
        march’s obvious failure to affect state policy, it did provide visible
        proof of Communist intent.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>According to Eugene Dennett, three CP leaders “fresh from the
        East”—Lowell Wakefield, Alan Max<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[viii]</span></a>
        and Hutchin R. Hutchins—attempted to assume control of the massed
        demonstration gathered at Sylvester Park in downtown Olympia.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, M.M. London led the UCL, United Producers and
        People’s Councils members in the direction of the capitol. The
        remainder of the crowd then marched under the Unemployed Councils’
        banners “a considerable distance” behind the first group. Scuffles
        broke out when both groups arrived at the capitol:</p>

normal">Vanguard</i> for readers and for influence in the now sharply divided
        unemployed movement. Persistence would pay off. Over the course of 1933,
        the Party would become more and more influential and the UCL would
        change focus, turning away from self-help activities and taking on the
        roles of agitation and education that the Party advocated. The expanded
        influence also paid off in a growing Party membership. Eugene Dennett
        recalls that in Bellingham in just one year &quot;the party had grown
        from the seven original members to over 150 enthusiastic active
        members.&quot;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[xii]</span></a></p>

      goals from within organizations that garnered more popular support than
      the Party could by itself. By gaining control of key positions within the
      Unemployed Citizens’ League (UCL) in Seattle, Communists in Washington
      may have achieved a greater degree of influence and, therefore, success
