		  	<p>For more than 60 years, Irene Hull has been a Communist Party member and dedicated activist. Born in Kansas in 19__, Hull moved to California when she was 7.            
		  	<p> Hull graduated from UCLA with an education degree, but in the midst of the Great Depression, work was hard to come by. After crisscrossing the Northwest with her husband and growing family in search of work, Hull finally came to settle in Vancouver, WA where she worked as a carpenter in the shipyards.</p>
		  	<p>In 1942, Hull joined the Communist Party. Since that time she has been active in a host of progressive causes. During the infamous Canwell hearings, Hull helped organize the Congress of American Women to protest communist persecution. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, she undertook political work for the Democratic Party and Progressive Party. In the 1970s, she was influential in founding the Coalition of Labor Union women, and recently she has been active with Jobs with Justice, a national coalition of religious, labor, and community organizations.</p>
		  	<p>Today, Hull remains an active member of the Washington State Communist Party.</p>
