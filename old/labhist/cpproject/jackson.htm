&quot;Out
of the conflicts that raged around the <i>Union Record</i>, loneliness and
confusion grew for me. As once I had clung to the hollow form of independence
while eastern monopoly took control of my child welfare exhibits, so now I clung
to the outworn form of comradeship, though the old comrades called each other
traitors. There began to arise in me the longing of the pioneer to escape from

Anna Louise Strong</font></b><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">
begins her autobiography <i>I Change Worlds,</i> with a story about herself as a
little girl wandering through a garden and realizing, for the first time in her
short life, the powerful sensation of loneliness. For the grown woman writing
her memoirs in 1935 this epiphany symbolized Anna Louise's steadfast, life-long
dedication to a Socialist ideal that united all human beings in peace. Anna Louise's'
journey to becoming an influential labor journalist did indeed begin in her
early childhood, but it would take moving to the Pacific Northwest and
demonstrating her talents in the pages of the Seattle Union Record to truly
steer her toward the radical journalism that would eventually become her
trademark to the world.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The various literary styles that Anna Louise utilized during her years employed
at the Seattle Union Record exemplify both her unique perspective on the
politics of class and gender and her rather paradoxical role in the Seattle
labor movement during the era of the General Strike of 1919. Through her ragged
verse poetry using the pseudonym Anise, Anna Louise revealed her powerful
abilities as a propagandist of socialist thought and union empowerment. While
Anise appealed to the male-dominant union workers, Anna Louise addressed the
issues concerning the role of women in the labor movement in the Ruth Ridgway
advice column. Through Ruth Ridgway, Anna Louise provided the forum for
discussing the complex debate amongst middle class Socialist women, the feminist
working class, and union men regarding the status of women in labor and society
itself. Most of her writing, regardless of the pseudonym, however, discussed
women in the realm of the domestic sphere. Thus, while Anna Louises journalism
reveals her to be a unique, authoritarian, female voice in a male-dominant labor
movement, her writing also shows her to be a paradoxical, ambivalent character,
torn between a progressive ideal and her traditional roots. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fascinating journey of Anna Louise began in Friend, Nebraska on November 14,
1885, when she was born two weeks early to first-time parents Sydney and Ruth
Strong. Anna Louises parents had met at Oberlin College, where Sydney pursued
his studies in Congregationalist ministry. Ruth found in herself a dedicated
activist in the struggle for equality on behalf of women and African-Americans.
It is clear that Anna Louises writing was heavily influenced by both of her
parents; the themes of Christianity and social justice are essential elements of
her early writing, and they exemplify motifs that she carried with her, and
displayed in her writing, throughout her life.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her parents encouraged the writing talents of Anna Louise by providing her with
a sound education both at a public school and at home. According to Anna Louise,
her mother destined her to be a writer from early childhood. Ruth Strong also
encouraged her children to be independent—a modern progressive mother, Anna
Louise called her. Eventually Anna Louise would attend college at Oberlin
herself, after completing her first year of study at Bryn Mawr. She earned her
B.A. in 1905 and went on to graduate study at the University of Chicago.
Graduating with honors, Anna Louise completed a dissertation entitled A
Consideration of Prayer from the Standpoint of Social Psychology at the
University of Chicago in 1908, at the age of 23. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While writing her Ph.D. thesis, Anna Louise officially began her career in
journalism at a Chicago newspaper called the Advance. Hired as an associate
editor, Anna Louise wrote under four different pseudonyms, using a certain name
with a specific topic. In her autobiography she explains being drawn to the idea
of using pen-names, stating: I knew that the purpose of this was to bluff our
readers into thinking that we had a big, expensive staff, but this already
seemed to me clever. Anna Louise would continue the practice of writing under
pseudonyms many more times throughout her journalistic career.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louises' time in Chicago working at the Advance would prove to be
short-lived, however. Always restless to travel to new sites of progressive
action, Anna Louise spent the next few years working on various campaigns and
projects that would introduce her to socialist ideology. Along with her father,
who had since relocated to Seattle after Ruth Strong died, Anna Louise organized
a campaign called Know Your City, a project devoted to promoting Christian
social ideals in various northwestern cities. Anna Louise would later travel to
the east coast to participate in the National Child Labor Committee, a
progressive project aimed at improving the lives of urban children. As a member
of the committee, Anna Louise contributed to lobbying, exhibits, and education
through research. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1911 Anna Louise began working on the Child Welfare Exhibit Program,
organized by the US children's Bureau. She became exhibit director later that
same year, accompanying the exhibits to England, Ireland, Panama, and the
Philippines over the next couple of years. It was during her travels with the
exhibits that Anna Louise came into contact with a number of left-wing social
workers and activists, among them her best friend Ruth White, that brought her
into contact with Socialism. In her autobiography, Anna Louise describes how
embracing Socialism seemed merely like common sense:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">Thus
I came to condemn capitalism, not through any oppression endured by me
personally, but through the very definition of efficiency which capitalism
taught me, for its own purposes. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By 1915, Anna Louise was growing restless with her work at the Children's
Bureau. She was content to settle in Seattle for several reasons. With the
winding down of her efforts with the Children's Bureau, and the failure of more
than one romantic relationship, Anna Louise's life had struck an impasse.
Moreover, Anna Louise, an avid mountaineer, was also clearly drawn to the
wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. The most significant reason for moving to
Seattle at that time, of course, was to care for her father. Despite the fact
that her brother Tracy lived in a neighboring house, Anna Louise fulfilled her
role as the dutiful eldest, not to mention single, daughter by moving into her
fathers house. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to Tracy B. Strongs' biography <i>Right in Her Soul</i>, Anna Louise
was able to focus her efforts in the public world after obtaining the security
of her family around her. Although she wanted to run for the state legislature,
Anna Louise's first endeavor in Seattle was to obtain a seat on the Seattle
School Board. Supported by pro-labor factions, women's organizations, and a
solid reputation from her work in the child labor movement, she promised to
bring a woman's point of view to education politics. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1916, Seattle was clearly a city noted for its progressive politics and
strong labor movement, and the excitement of such an atmosphere inspired Anna
Louise. While she did have a strong foundation in socialist beliefs and
left-wing ideology, her experiences within and influences of the Seattle labor
movement, especially the events leading up to and including the General Strike,
would serve to radicalize Anna Louise in her socialist convictions. It was
through her writing, however, that Anna Louise earned the label of revolutionary
from the Seattle public. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise made her Seattle journalistic debut at the Seattle Daily Call, a
weekly socialist newspaper that did not last long after she began her employment
there. The Seattle Daily Call was associated with various left-wing factions,
and Anna Louise, who was writing under the pseudonym Gale, was soon becoming
known throughout the city for her radical tendencies. After reporting on the
Everett trial for the New York's Saturday Evening Post, in which she tended to
favor the leftist International Workers of the World, or I.W.W., Anna Louise
became associated with the Bolshevik cause. Because of her new, radical
reputation, a campaign to recall Anna Louise from the Seattle School Board soon
began to take shape. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise eventually lost her seat on the school board, an especially poignant
loss in light of the fact that she was the first woman member in several years.
She would not leave the board quietly, however, choosing instead to use the
recall campaign to educate the public on the evils of Big Business. Asserting
that corporate big-wigs influenced every aspect in Seattle, Anna Louise sought
to connect the unchecked power of capitalism with social responsibilities such
as the appropriation of education funds. Her files contain letters that bear
witness to the public debate that ensued—letters from strangers who offered
support for a woman who they felt truly captured the interests of the common Seattleite.
Thus, covering the Everett trial and her ensuing recall from the school board
seem to provide the impetus that would motivate Anna Louise to a new level of
militantism in her writing.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the Seattle Daily Call fell into bankruptcy, Anna Louise was immediately
hired by Harry Ault, editor of the Seattle Union Record. In her autobiography,
Anna Louise declares that she was offered whatever position she wished within
the paper, which had just undergone the change from weekly to daily printing.
She became the Union Records feature editor, making her responsible for the
editorial and feature (womens ) pages. Aside from the editorials that Ault
himself wrote and articles from contributing Socialist authors, Anna Louise
apparently wrote, or at the very least edited, everything in the feature
section. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although she regularly contributed editorial articles and appeared as an advice
columnist, Anna Louise became famous throughout Seattle through her daily poems
signed Anise. Her use of the pseudonym was never intended to disguise her true
identity:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">And
Anise is short for Anna Louise Strong, recalled from the School Board, just in
time to start work on a really interesting job as feature and magazine editor of
the Union Record. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Anise writings were formatted in an informal poetry style described as
ragged verse. The format was not her original creation: Anna Louise borrowed the
style from various religious and literary works. Furthermore, at the time, this
form of writing was being used by the author known as K.C.B. who wrote for the
Seattle Times. Mary Joan O'Connell argues that, despite mimicking the style of a
writer published in a rival newspaper, Anna Louise was clearly responsible for
popularizing the writing form through her near-daily poem. The Anise poem
included in almost each days edition of the Union Record was unmistakably
designed by its author to attract the eye of the reader, both in content and
form. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anise's ragged verse covered a multitude of subjects, including nature and the
outdoors, racism, and of course, the labor issues of the period. Even when she
discussed a seemingly non-political topic, such as nature, in her daily poetry,
however, Anise was alluding to larger philosophical perspectives. Every article
was infused with either a progressive subtlety or with an overt declaration, of
Socialist ideals. Anna Louise's defense of the proletariat was a constant
presence in her ragged verse. In an article entitled Those Big, Cool Houses, for
example, Anise describes the coexistence of crowded settlement housing and empty
winter houses of the wealthy in New York City; she then comments on how the
Communists who took over Hungary redistributed housing. Anise then concludes:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">And
I wondered WHEN<br>

</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">Furthermore,
examples of Anise's poems display infusions of the Christian values Anna Louise
was raised with:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">And
we are all put here<br>
To HELP each other;<br>
And that is Christian-like.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A typical Anise verse was formatted into three columns, each line of which was
separated by three asterisks. Anise also used the device of attracting attention
to specific words and phrases through capitalization. Inserted approximately
every few lines, these emphasized words would highlight the poems labor theme.
Anises poetry demonstrates a fairly consistent capitalization of words such as
UNION, TOGETHER, LABOR, and RIGHTS to highlight her ragged verse, both visually
and literarily.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another characteristic of Anises literary style was her use of a personal story
of an individual, oftentimes a member of the working class, to exemplify a
greater issue, usually relating to social class consciousness. An extension of
the personal story was the self-interview device, composing lines such as When I
worked for the United States Children's Bureau, says a member of our staff....
Anna Louise would incorporate these personal accounts in order to show the
plight of the individual—to put a face to the working class citizen. By the
end of one of her verses, however, Anise would have cleverly translated this
individual case into a global vision of human solidarity, showing the reading
audience how the unity of workers could embody a powerful force in society. An
example of this transition can be seen in an article entitled On Behalf of All
Men, that begins:<o:p>
</o:p>

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although she confronted various issues in her Anise poetry, Anna Louise did not
usually use the column to discuss the plight of women. Indeed, Anises tone
toward women's issues does not appear to be one of exaggerated devotion to the
suffrage movement. Anise did not argue that women could add a new sense of
morality to politics if only allowed to participate in that realm of society,
nor did she assert that women were inherently better creatures than men; she
did, however, argue against the actual role in society that women had been
designated. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the Anise column may have ignored many of the larger events that dealt
with the quest for women's suffrage, Anise did occasionally write about issues
that specifically addressed the issue of women in labor. In these few instances,
Anise would write in the usual format, basing her verse on a particular personal
story of a woman confronting the issues of the labor movement. In the poem <i>A Woman's
Story</i>, Anise describes the plight of a woman from Virginia whose life, and
that of her child, greatly improved as a direct result of her becoming involved
in the labor movement:<o:p>

Another poem by Anise entitled <i>What Women Shall Do</i> depicts the debate
surrounding the issue of whether women workers should be permitted to wear
overalls while working in a factory. Despite the controversy over the
appropriate apparel for women in the workforce amongst women of the upper
classes, Anise describes how this kind of discussion by women is purely
arbitrary; men had the real control, and would ultimately make the decisions, in
regards to what women would wear. <o:p>

In addition to being a brilliant writer, Anna Louise was a talented
propagandist. Her strategic manipulation of her writing could capture the
readership that she intended, and this fact speaks powerfully to her views on
the politics of gender. Except for a handful of instances, Anna Louise did not
specifically discuss women's rights in her ragged verse poetry. Instead, Anise
would include stories of women as mothers, or women as workers; but her writing
suggests that these women were defined in these roles primarily before being
thought of as women. Moreover, the Anise poems demonstrate the perspective that
a woman's class status was more inhibiting than her gender.<o:p>

<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise was also a strategist when it came to writing about racial issues.
In an article she wrote entitled To Stir Up Race Hatred, Anise describes the
unfair treatment of an African-American labor organizer; but Anna Louise is
subtle with her words, persuading her audience with the assertion that the
bosses were using these black workers to divide the movement:<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">And
I thought: WHEN<br>
Will the workers be as clever<br>
At STICKING TOGETHER<br>
As the boss is<br>
At DIVIDING THEM?<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of course Anna Louise's argument was an honest one, but she placed all of the
blame on the bosses for ...stirring up white men to HATE THEM. She omitted any
discussions of the rights of African-Americans as human beings.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise wrote the Anise poems to encourage and advance the labor
movement—a movement by and large dominated by white males. In order to
maintain the attention of and influence over these male members of the labor
force, the ones who really possessed the leadership and authority within the
labor movement, Anna Louise wrote specifically for them. To ensure reaching the
greatest number of readers, Anna Louise chose not to focus on gender and racial
issues; this was especially essential in a movement that clearly practiced
systematic discrimination against women and racial minorities. Thus, although
the topic of women was surely not censored from her articles, Anise did not
pursue the issue of women's role in labor to the point of alienating the male
working force. Anna Louise offered the wealthy, aristocratic business men as the
enemy, not the humble working class men; it was the owners of production who
were making the decision on whether women would wear overalls in the factory or
not—not institutionalized sexism.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Despite the apparent exclusion of gender in her writing as Anise, in addition to
generally ignoring issues of race, Anna Louise did indeed transmit her Socialist
message to the Seattle public, most noticeably during the period surrounding the
General Strike of 1919. Through her most famous editorial in the Union Record,
Anna Louise made quite an impact on the mood of the strike. On February 4<sup>th</sup>,
the infamous NO ONE KNOWS WHERE editorial appeared on the front page of the
Union Record, exemplifying the uncertainty felt by labor leadership—including
Anna Louise herself—in response to the strike. Despite fully acknowledging the
General Strikes lack of clear, focused direction, Anna Louise was excited,
perhaps overzealously so, in anticipation of a social revolution: <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">We
are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made LABOR in this country, a move
which will lead—NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">...BUT,
the closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of Seattle, while
the WORKERS ORGANIZE to feed the people, to care for the babies and the sick, to
preserve order—THIS will move them, for this looks too much like the taking
over of POWER by the workers <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This article would prove to be the most symbolic writing associated with the
Seattle General Strike.&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Interestingly, Anna Louise neglected to name herself, or Anise, as the
author for this headlining editorial. Her audience was sure to know that it was
the work of Anise, however, merely by the literary style—the capitalized words
and consistent use of hyphening—that was characteristic of her daily ragged
verse poetry. Despite intending the editorial for the male-centered unions, Anna
Louises mention of caring for the babies and the sick demonstrates a certain
ambiguity in her convictions. Anna Louise could not evade the issues of the
domestic realm.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise's editorial led to serious ramifications for the fate of the General
Strike. Tracy B. Strong asserts that the editorial contributed to encouraging
Seattle workers to focus more on, and explore to a greater extent, issues
concerning the undefined goals of the strike. While the article may have
inspired workers to construct aims in addition to encouraging Seattleites to
support the efforts of the strikers, Anna Louise inadvertently exacerbated the
fear of radical revolution amongst the middle class. Furthermore, the article
contributed to the already-existent sensationalism in the media. Rival
newspapers, such as the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and labor-sympathetic papers
such as the Seattle Star, responded vociferously with exaggerated accounts of an
impending Seattle Revolution, Bolshevik style. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise's controversial editorials would eventually lead to her arrest in
April, along with the rest of the staff of the Union Record for their
involvement in promoting the General Strike. Accused of plotting to incite
resistance against the United States government, the charges were eventually
dismissed, but not before branding Anna Louise a dangerously revolutionary
Communist. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Records from the Minute Men, a powerful, semi-official group of spies designed
to infiltrate and suppress sedition, reported on an editorial Anna Louise wrote
in which she promotes certain classes being offered at the University of
Washington during the summer session following the General Strike. The report
accuses Anise of scheming to flood certain classes...with a wobbly [ I.W.W.]
element to such a large extent that the radicals take complete possession of the
course and the teacher, and thereby rendering the opinions of the teacher and
other students useless... Thus, Anna Louise's editorials would continue to be
perceived as a threat to the status quo well after the strike ended.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While her feature editorials and Anise poems exemplified her radical politics,
especially regarding the government and labor issues, Anna Louise demonstrated
yet another dimension of her journalistic style and staunch opinions through the
Ruth Ridgway column. Appearing on the women's page of the <i>Seattle Union
Record</i>, letters to the advice columnist Ruth Ridgway provided a forum for
the discussion of women's issues. Moreover, it served as a forum for Anna Louise
herself to give her views on the role of women in the labor movement and the
process of social change.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Identifying Ruth Ridgway as Anna Louise Strong has been a rather elusive
endeavor. While Anna Louise claims that she wrote almost a complete page of the
Union Record nearly everyday, she makes no mention in her autobiography of
contributing to the advice column. Moreover, Anna Louise does not offer much as
to her feelings about the role of women within the labor movement in I Change
Worlds. A few sources describe Ruth Ridgway as representing several different
women working at the Union Record. It appears that following Anna Louise's
resignation from the Union Record, the Ruth Ridgway column was taken over by
either Mary L. Chamberlain, a former staff writer for Survey magazine, or Mary
Ahlgren, a former federal wartime social worker. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The evidence connecting Anna Louise with the advice columnist, however, is quite
compelling. First, the Ruth Ridgway column began in April of 1918, around the
same time that Anna Louise was hired onto the Union Record staff. Second, the
column stopped for a period of months that correspond with a vacation taken by
Anna Louise. Furthermore, Ruth was the name of both Anna Louise's mother and her
best friend, a woman who helped with her introduction to Socialism. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The name Ruth Ridgway was an appropriate choice for a pen-name for the column
since Anna Louise's own mother was named Ruth. An active advocate for many women's
organizations and clubs in her life, Ruth Strongs influence in Anna Louise's
journalistic career can be clearly seen in this Union Record column. The
Magazine page of the Record was solely devoted to women's issues, the news
articles mainly dedicated to fashion, beauty, children, cooking—issues
associated with fulfilling the role of a good wife. The Ruth Ridgway column
provided a certain contrast to these domestic topics; the advice column was
politically charged and served as a platform for debate about the actual role
women should play within the labor movement and society itself.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While Anises main target audience was generally working class men, the Ruth
Ridgway column aimed to draw in the letters of the activist housewife. The
debates outlined in the column covered such controversial topics as the
implications of wage-earning vs. homemaking role for women, equal pay for wage
earners, and the continuing struggle to define the concept of femininity.
Several of the columns in May were devoted to the issue of married women working
for a wage:<o:p>

At times, the advice column would not print any letters, instead serving more as
an editorial column for Ruth Ridgway. In one issue from 1918, Ruth Ridgway asks
her readers How is the war affecting your children? She then proceeds to discuss
several tales of how children interpret the war. These stories, Ruth Ridgway
argues, were vouched for by a friend of mine. The advice columnist argues for
equal pay for women , and for the socialization of housework that would allow
women to become equal wage-earners. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the women's page of the Seattle Union Record promoted the
stereotypical image of the middle-class woman residing in the sphere of
domesticity. By focusing on fashion and appearance, the articles acted, in
essence, as an advertisement for women of middle-income families, never mind
that the Union Record was a newspaper created for the working class. The women's
page typically included a Daily Recipe, a daily Fashion Tip, and a column called
My Husband and I, written by Jane Phelps. Articles such as these were not
inherently useful to the average wage-earning woman, who was single and usually
lived at home or in a boarding house. This is not to say that married wives and
mothers did not participate in labor, but their number as a wage-earning group
was significantly smaller. Although the Ruth Ridgway column did tend to seize
more substantial topics with more serious consequences for women, the column
still encouraged the sexual division of labor. Women were encouraged to aid in
the labor movement by being good activist housewives and raising class conscious
children. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ambiguous nature of the magazine page illustrates the struggle for many
women to define the role of gender within the efforts of the labor movement. To
a certain extent, Anna Louise embodied the problematic role of the Socialist
woman in early twentieth-century America. In general, Socialists combined the
interests of the women's struggle for equality and the plight of the
workers—they failed to view women as having distinct conditions to deal with.
While they fully acknowledged the fact that women were forced into low-paying,
often temporary employment and were generally responsible for housework and
childcare, Socialist ideology did not consider any kind of domestic role as
contributing to real production. The protagonist of history, in the minds of
Socialists, was the proletariat. While Anna Louise's writing appears to reflect
this Socialist ideology, themes of domestic life and children abound in her
columns, suggesting an ambivalence about the role of women in the labor
movement. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise Strong was an enigmatic, influential, and unique character in the
Seattle labor arena. She came to the Pacific Northwest as an unknown journalist
with a vision of social revolution without arms; she left Seattle a notorious
writer whose words had penetrated the ranks of a white-male dominated labor
movement. Though many Seattleites—politicians, the aristocracy, and even much
of the middle class—disagreed with her political philosophy, no one can
dispute the brilliance she demonstrated in her journalistic abilities. The
variation of written material that she produced so quickly for the Seattle Union
Record is testimony to her dedication as a writer: Anna Louise wrote about
nature, labor, race, gender, and the personal lives of strangers and
friends—all within the framework of a quest for a social transformation
leading toward peace. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though she happily made her life in Russia, and eventually in China, after her
years in Seattle, Anna Louise always felt a certain obligation to her homeland.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">For
there is another land who workers have the right to claim that I deserted the
struggle which I with them began. In times and ways and to an extent yet
undecided, I recognize their right to call me back. My life must henceforth as I
have made it, a link between two lands. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anna Louise romanticized that a social revolution that would bring equality of
all classes would naturally translate into the equality of all people regardless
of race or gender. She by no means equated the white-male dominated labor
movement in Seattle, and in other cities across the country, with the
promulgation of gender and race discrimination in unions. Anna Louise was
bothered by the question of women's status and did not enjoy being ordered into
a designated role. Ironically, however, the structure of the Union Record
contributed to the perpetuation of this practice. Furthermore, Anna Louise
herself fulfilled the typical single, middle-class woman's role both at home and
professionally through her work in the children's welfare movement and the
school board. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 1.2in"><font face="Garamond" size="3" color="#800000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The writings of Anna Louise Strong show the complexity and paradoxical nature of
her role in the labor movement. In one sense, Anna Louise's writing demonstrated
her feeling that women were oppressed because they were workers, not because of
their gender. However, neither Anna Louise, nor Anise, nor, especially Ruth
Ridgway, could escape the traditional tendencies embedded in her family life or
her middle-class roots. Anna Louise would eventually leave the domestic sphere
of her family in Seattle and become a pioneer in another nation before she would
truly seize her independence. <o:p>
