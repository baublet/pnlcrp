			<h4>The 1948 Canwell UnAmerican Activities Hearings and Mark Jenkins' <em>All Powers Necessary and Convenient</em></h4>
			<p><img src="/labhist/cpproject/images/canwell/all%20powers%20flag%20scene.jpg" width="356" height="225" class="right">Shortly after 10:00 a.m. on July  19, 1948, Albert F. Canwell, state representative from Spokane and chair of the Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, called the session to order: &ldquo;Before we proceed, I wish to state that we will proceed with proper dignity here; no demonstrations will be tolerated, no speeches from the audience; any violation of that...will be summarily dealt with.&rdquo; So began five days of hearings on the issue of Communist activities at the University of Washington. The Canwell hearings would have wide and lasting consequences. Six tenured faculty members would  face sanctions from the University and three would lose their jobs. Other legislatures and other universities  followed the Washington example and began to look for radicals in the halls of academe. The Cold War Red Scare gained momentum.</p>

			<p>Fifty years later, in February, 1998, Seattle once again watched Albert Canwell and his committee hunt communists at the University of Washington, this time as part of a remarkable play written by Mark Jenkins. <em>All Powers Necessary and Convenient</em> took its title from the enabling legislation that created the Joint Legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. Produced by the UW School of Drama and featuring a cast of nearly 30 actors, the play used actual testimony to recreate the tense drama of accusation, intimidation, and courage that had unfolded a half century earlier. Large audiences filled the playhouse theater for each performance and attended the lectures and other public events that accompanied the play. And it was quickly apparent  that something unique was happening. All Powers had brought history to life at an important moment, helping several generations come to terms with an important episode in their collective past.</p>
