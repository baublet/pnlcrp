        <p> On the morning of September 17, 1952, squads of four to eight FBI agents stormed the houses and workplaces of seven Seattle citizens. Each arrest was made as if the seven were &ldquo;dangerous criminals.&rdquo; Their crime: participating in and advocating a conspiracy to violently overthrow the United States government. The Alien Registration Act of 1940, better known as the &ldquo;Smith Act,&rdquo; was first designed to persecute potentially fascist non-citizens during World War II. After the war, as the Red Scare grew and the threat of communism knocked at the proverbial front door of the United States, the Smith Act was amended to shield capitalist values from their ideological enemies. During the mid-1940s, the Act was redesigned to prosecute United States citizens conspiring against the American government as well. The specific text of the Act sought to punish those who &ldquo; knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the duty, necessity, desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association&rdquo; (Smith Act Trial). </p>
        <p> The Alien Registration Act was enacted on June 28, 1940. Proposed by Virginia senator Howard Smith, the official title was quickly replaced by the colloquial name that paid homage to its creator. In using the Smith Act to bring down communist leaders, groups of people rather than individuals were the usual targets. The first use of the Smith Act against United States citizens was in the July 20, 1948 arrests of the &ldquo;New York Eleven.&rdquo; This case was significant in determining the legality of the Act. Eugene Dennis, a member of the &ldquo;New York Eleven,&rdquo; challenged the constitutionality of the Smith Act. Dennis appealed his conviction to the highest court of the land, but on June 4, 1951, the Supreme Court upheld the convictions, affirming the validity of the Act, and set a precedent that would not be overturned until 1958 (Smith Act News, 1951). Between the Dennis trial and the trials in Seattle that began in 1952, five other groups were arrested around the country on charges of violating the Smith Act: on June 20, 1951, seventeen New York citizens were charged, followed by six arrests in Pittsburgh, fourteen arrests in California in July, and on August 7, six suspected communist leaders in Maryland were charged with federal offenses. Just before the Smith Act reached the Pacific Northwest in 1952, seven assumed communist leaders were arrested in Honolulu (Smith Act News, 1951). </p>
        <p> September 17, 1952 marked the start of the communist witch hunt and unconstitutional laws of the Smith Act in Seattle. Henry Huff, Karley Larsen, John S. Daschbach, Terry Pettis, William Pennock, Barbara Hartle, and Paul Bowen were the targets of the federal government&rsquo;s program of removing potential communist threats within the country. Huff, Larsen, and Hartle were arrested in Oregon at union meetings, and ordered back to Seattle (Folder 5/18, Seattle Times, September 19, 1952). Karley Larsen had, for seventeen consecutive years, held the position of the first vice-president of the International Woodworkers Union of Western Washington. Henry Huff was the Washington state chairman of the Communist Party. Barbara Hartle, the only woman in the Seattle Seven, was known around the Pacific Northwest to thousands of workers for her rousing speeches at communist rallies. She was an outspoken proponent and member of the Communist Party. To the FBI, Hartle was &ldquo;Washington&rsquo;s top woman Communist&rdquo; (Seattle Times). Hartle was arrested at a regional meeting of the Civic Unity Committee, of which she was also an avid member. Paul Bowen and Terry Pettus, both well-known members of the Communist Party, were detained outside of the Seattle area. Bowen, the only African-American in the group, was an active trade unionist, advocated for black rights, and was a United States war veteran (Daily People&rsquo;s World, Folder 5/18). Pettus made his living as the Northwest editor for the <em>Daily People&rsquo;s World</em>, a West-coast communist newspaper. John S. Daschbach and William (Bill) J. Pennock were both in Seattle at the times of their arrests. John, or Johnny to his friends, was a &ldquo;champion of the fight against repressive law and in behalf of the rights of the [African-American] people and director of the Civil Rights Congress,&rdquo; (Daily People&rsquo;s World, Folder 5/18). Pennock, president of the Washington Pension Union, or WPU, (an organization Bowen and Pettus also belonged to), served eight consecutive years as a Democratic Representative in the Washington state legislature and was recognized as an upstanding member of the Seattle community. Although all were, at least at one point in time, vocal members of the Communist Party, none were ever charged with any acts of violence or conspiracy. Essentially, it was the defendants&rsquo; ideological beliefs that were being put on trial. </p>
        <p> Communists were not the only people upset with the blatant violation of rights and &ldquo;Nazi-like qualities&rdquo; of the Smith Act (Civil Rights Congress, Folder /12). Many citizens in the Seattle community wrote to newspapers around the area in anger. Members of the Civil Rights Committee voiced their contempt for the American government a day after the arrests in a press release, arguing that &ldquo;in the arrests the government has illegally invaded not only the Communist Party, but it has invaded labor and the press organizations of the people which are composed of persons of all political opinions&rdquo; (Civil Rights Congress, Folder 5/12). The WPU held a huge rally to protest the arrests, where wives of the defendants told their stories (Nelson, 22 Sep. 1952). Friends and family members spoke of the injustices and prejudicial treatment the seven defendants were receiving. While visiting their loved ones in jail, family members witnessed open discrimination: the Seattle Seven were allowed visitation only by relatives on Saturdays, a rule not followed in regards to any other inmates (Nelson, 22 Sep. 1952). When lawyers or family members did visit on Saturdays, they were forced to write down their names and addresses. Each defendant was set a bail of $25,000 , which was prohibitively high. For Huff, the amount was even higher, at $40,000 (Seattle Times, 19 Sep. 1952). </p>
        <p> The bail hearing of Pennock and Daschbach, which took place on September 19, 1952 at the Federal Courthouse in Seattle, was packed. Over 50 WPU members, along with the families of the defendants and numerous reporters, were present as bail was reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 by Judge Bowen (Seattle Times, 19 Sep. 1952). Daschbach and Pennock were the only two in Seattle at the time of their arrests, which is why their bails were challenged separately. In the beginning, all of the defendants hired their own lawyers, but as time progressed and they began preparing for the next trial in early 1953, the separate attorneys began to organize together as a defense team. Irvin Goodman was the attorney for Terry Pettus and Barbara Hartle. John Walthew served as representation for Karly Larsen. Paul Bowen hired a civil rights specialist, C.T. Hatten. Sarah Lesser and Siegfried Hesse, attorneys for the Civil Rights Congress, were the original lawyers of John Daschbach and Bill Pennock, but shortly after the bail hearings, Daschbach hired John Caughlin, who soon became the group&rsquo;s lead defense attorney, though Lesser and Hesse remained on the defense team (Caughlin, 1952). </p>
        <p> On November 7, 1953, Caughlin filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of three arguments. He claimed the trial would violate his clients&rsquo; sixth amendment right to an &ldquo;impartial jury of their peers&rdquo; due to the hysteria and notoriety surrounding the trial. Next, Caughlin asserted that the Smith Act itself was unconstitutional and therefore the defendants should be freed of all charges. Lastly, the vagueness and insufficiency of the charges brought against all seven of the defendants was enough to throw the case out (Motion to Dismiss). Soon after the motion was denied, Daschbach himself wrote a personal request for dismissal due to the unconstitutional nature of the Alien Registration Act, the prejudices surrounding their imprisonment and arrests, and the violation of his sixth amendment rights. He wrote that his arrest was made to be &ldquo;as melodramatic and startling as possible,&rdquo; and that the publicity that followed would work against any possibility of acquiring a fair and unbiased jury (Daschbach, 1952). The court denied the Seven&rsquo;s motion for postponement, which the defense had wanted in order to adequately prepare their case, so the lawyers representing the Seattle Seven quickly began organizing for the upcoming trial. </p>
        <p> Judge William Lindberg presided as the trial began in April of 1953, at the Federal District Courthouse on 5th Avenue and Madison in downtown Seattle (Newsletter No. 6). Court was in session Tuesday through Friday, starting promptly at 9:30am and ending at 4pm. In his opening statement, John Caughlin claimed the defendants&rsquo; &ldquo;efforts have been devoted to protecting democratic liberties guaranteed by the constitution&rdquo; (Miller, 203). The defense team did not seek to support or defend the Communist Party and the defendants&rsquo; ideologies, as had been the strategy of the previous Smith Act trials. Instead, Caughlin and his team argued that the United States Constitution protected basic civil liberties, allowing their clients the right to personal beliefs. Later, members of the original Seattle Seven succinctly explained their defense in a letter to the St. Louis Smith Act defendants in 1954, exclaiming that &ldquo;the Smith Act is a thought control act, completely repugnant to the American tradition of free speech, press, and association&rdquo; (Seattle Defendants). </p>
        <p> Tracy Griffin represented the United States government as the lead prosecutor. The prosecution argument against the defendants was twofold. First, all seven defendants were charged with entering into a conspiracy to advocate the overthrow of the United States government (illegal under the Smith Act). Second, they were accused of forming the Communist Party in the Northwest as a vehicle to carry out this conspiracy. Griffin&rsquo;s tactic was to connect the &ldquo;Communist Party literature [to] the intentions and motivations&rdquo; of the seven on trial (Miller, 204). To do this, he read aggressive passages of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin from Communist Party literature throughout the trial. </p>
        <p> During the seven-month-long trial, many noteworthy events took place. On May 19th, about a month into the trial, the prosecution announced that the next day they would put an undercover surprise witness on the stand. When Caughlin requested that Judge Lindberg make the prosecution reveal the name of the witness and allow the defense adequate time to prepare a cross-examination, he was denied (Newsletter, No. 6). In an article written a day later, a writer for the <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em> admitted the undeniable biases enacted against the defendants, the denial of Caughlin&rsquo;s request being an obvious example. The next day the surprise witness appeared. Harley More, a member of the International Woodworkers of America&ndash;CIO union in Snohomish, admitted to being paid $10,000 by the FBI for his work as an informant. He reported any &ldquo;communist&rdquo; activity within the union and worked to recruit people into the Communist Party, turning those names over to the FBI (Newsletter, No. 9). Harley claimed that he had personally witnessed &ldquo;communist behavior&rdquo; by Karly Larsen at many union meetings they both attended (Newsletter, No. 6). The most dramatic event to take place during the trial wasn&rsquo;t until much later: on August 2, 1953, William J. Pennock committed suicide. He was found on the 80th trial day in his West Seattle home, after ingesting a lethal dose of prescription drugs (Miller, 207). </p>
        <p> In November of 1953, all six remaining defendants were found guilty of violating clauses of the Smith Act. Although not a single piece of evidence was brought forth indicating that any of the defendants had committed violent acts of rebellion, they were still charged with &ldquo;advocating a conspiracy to overthrow the United States government.&rdquo; The defendants were sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000 each. Barbara Hartle was acquitted of all charges soon after she cut ties with the Communist Party and became an informant for the FBI. The other five served about a year of their sentences before they were released on bail, pending an appeal to the United States 9th Circuit of Appeals (The Cold War and Red Scare). At that time, the United States Supreme Court was deciding whether or not to review the California Smith Act trials. The 9th Circuit Appeals Court chose to wait for the decision in the California case before hearing the Seattle appeal. The remaining five&rsquo;s convictions were overturned on appeal in 1958, five years after their trial (The Cold War and Red Scare). </p>
        <p> Nationally, over 140 United States citizens had been arrested by 1957 for violations of the Smith Act. The Supreme Court made two important decisions that effectually voided the Smith Act in 1957 and 1958. In Yates v. The United States, the justices of the high court decided that the teaching of abstract ideas was not the same as advocating a conspiracy. Soon after, in Watkins v. The United States, it was maintained that it was not the business of the federal government to expose their citizens&rsquo; private affairs. Although the Smith Act is still on the books today, it has not been used since 1961. </p>        <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent: 0.0in; line-height: 150%" align="left"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
