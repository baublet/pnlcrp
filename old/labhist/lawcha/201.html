<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>For almost twenty years, since the 1999 “Battle of Seattle” WTO
demonstrations, the labor movement in Washington State has pioneered new
strategies in the fight for workers’ rights while helping turn Seattle into
one of the most politically progressive and activist cities in the country.
Recent minimum-wage, sick-leave, and secure-scheduling laws are only some of
the victories that have been won by a coalition of social movements led by the
State Labor Council and M.L. King County Labor Council.  In this time when
labor victories are rare and when strategies of resistance more important than
ever, this panel will offer lessons from the state where labor and social
justice movements have been aggressive, smart, and successful.</p>

<p>Nicole Grant is an electrician and Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the
M.L. King County Labor Council</p>

<p>Jeff Johnson is President of the Washington State Labor Council representing
600 union locals and councils and 400,000 members</p>

<p>Senator Rebecca Saldana represents the 37th District in the Washington
Legislator. She is the former Executive Director of Puget Sound Sage.</p>

<p>Nancy MacLean is a professor of History at Duke University and immediate past
president of LAWCHA</p> </p>
