<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This roundtable panel will examine the legacy and importance of Chicana/o and
Labor Historian Dr. Dionicio Valdés. In 1991, Valdés published Al Norte:
Agricultural Workers in the Great Lakes Region, 1917-1970, a pioneering book on
Mexican agricultural workers in the Midwestern U.S. It also challenged the
Southwest-centric historical focus of Chicana/o Labor History and Chicana/o
Studies. He later co-edited Voices of a New Chicana/o History (2000) with
Refugio I. Rochín. He followed up with Barrios Nortenos: St. Paul and
Midwestern Mexican Communities in the Twentieth Century (2000) and Mexicans in
Minnesota (2005).  Valdés then published Organized Agriculture and the Labor
Movement before the UFW:  Puerto Rico, Hawaii, California (2011), the first
scholarly book to examine comparative agricultural labor production,
imperialism and the labor movement in major agricultural unionization drives
prior to the appearance of the United Farmworkers Union (UFW). In addition, for
nearly 40 years Valdés has published influential and original monographs,
academic articles and book reviews. Each panelist is a scholar and an activist,
and will reflect on at least one text and discuss how his scholarship has
influenced the fields of Chicana/o Labor History and Chicana/o Studies, and the
role of activism in labor scholarship. Valdés will offer final comments and
remarks on his current historical research projects and publications. The
panelists intend to submit their papers for publication in the LAWCHA journal.</p> </p>
