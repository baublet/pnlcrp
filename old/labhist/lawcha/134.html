<h4>Obreros y Estudiantes, Unidos y Adelante! Local and Transnational Student-Worker Solidarities in Uruguay, 1929-1958</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>During the Early Cold War years (broadly defined here as the decades of the
1930s, 40s, and 50s), Uruguayan university students were deeply engaged with
the broader social, economic, and political concerns of domestic and
international affairs.        Students in the Federation of Uruguayan University
Students (FEUU) at the University of the Republic were so deeply connected to
these causes that they made the commitment to improving society part of the
organization’s official platform. While initially imagining this process as
an extension of the University into the community and the working class
populations, the FEUU quickly realized that students also had much to learn
from workers. This approach laid the groundwork for developing a strong
relationship between students an workers that would be tested and contested by
the state during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. Throughout this era, in the years
leading up to the more tumultuous 1960s, students from the FEUU attended labor
union meetings, supported worker strikes, and participated in marches as
outspoken advocates for unions and workers’ rights, both at home and abroad. 
Reciprocally, various union leaders became important allies in the FEUU’s
campaign for University reforms, regularly attending student meetings and
marches, while also offering strategic advice.        This mutually beneficial
relationship was often cited at demonstrations with banners that read,
“Workers and Students, United and Forward.”  As a result of these
interactions, students drew connections between the poor labor conditions of
their compatriots and the inadequacies of the capitalist system that were
lobbied as critiques of Uruguay’s national politics and a growing resistance
to the global Cold War binary.        Thus, the relationship between workers and
students in Uruguay pushed many university students to think beyond the local
circumstances, situating themselves and the struggles of workers in a larger,
interconnected transnational framework.</p> </p>
