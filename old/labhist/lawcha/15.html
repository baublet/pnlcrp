<h4>Blue-Collar Cosmopolitans: Sailors, Pullman Porters, and Working-Class Sophistication in the Industrial Era</h4>

<em>James Barrett</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The term “cosmopolitan” is rarely used in relation to working-class people.
Yet some with broad perspectives and travel experience appear to qualify for
the label – the globe-trotting immigrant, the well-read deep water sailor,
the African American Pullman Porter, the socialist militant.  Long before
current notions of “globalization,” such workers linked their local
communities with the broader world. Judging from autobiographies, some sailors
were not only more widely-traveled, but also often better-read than middle
class people. Aside from their cosmopolitan experience and perspective,
maritime workers occupied a vital place in labor history, as they often
provided the links required for transnational social and political movements.
Likewise, Pullman Porters helped to spread Black freedom movement literature
and ideas, connecting activists as they traveled through cities around the U.S.
The socialist machinist’s or garment worker’s personal life may have been
circumscribed by their factory walls and city neighborhood, but with the rise
of socialist movements, her/his worldview, political goals, and strategies were
inherently transnational. In placing such experiences in relation to our
understandings of the cosmopolitan, we not only illuminate the lives of these
workers but also broaden our notions of the cosmopolitan.</p> </p>
