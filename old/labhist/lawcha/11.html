<h4>Female Wobblies in Wartime</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>World War I was a tumultuous time for the Industrial Workers of the World in
the Pacific Northwest.                    In addition to the massive trial of Wobbly
leadership
in Chicago, and the smaller but infamous cases of Louise Olivereau and Marie
Equi and Seattle and Portland, little-known Wobbly women were also at risk
during this period.</p>

<p>Female Wobblies risked arrest for simple membership in the organization during
the repressive years of the Red Scare. While the male leadership was rounded up
in raids across the country, women were arrested for supporting the
organization behind the scenes by editing and distributing the Industrial
Worker, providing support for men in jail, and working with defense
organizations to raise money for trial expenses and to support the families of
those in jail. While womenâ€™s work in jail support and defense is important,
it was typical for women to be supportive behind-the-scenes, rather than as
frontline agitators. The authorities, however, recognized this support as
essential to the Wobbly cause, and therefore women were targets of federal
surveillance as much as any of the well-known male Wobblies of the period. This
paper examines how the massive arrests affected Wobbly communities in the
Pacific Northwest and how women worked to support those in jail and risked
arrest themselves.</p> </p>
