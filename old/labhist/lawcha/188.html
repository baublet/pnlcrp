    <p>□  Black Railroad Shopmen, the 1922 Strike, and Civil Rights Struggles in
Texas
Railroad shop work is one relatively unexplored vein of African American
working-class history. Shop towns and cities dotted the US landscape, and, in
the South, black workers often dominated unskilled and semi-skilled shop
positions. Most accounts of black shopmen are national or southern in scope.
This paper anchors its study in Texas, but especially Marshall, Texas, where
the Texas &amp; Pacific employed hundreds of black and white men in its sprawling
railroad shops complex. News coverage of the 1922 national railroad shopmen’s
strike, along with census and city directory records and oral interviews,
allows a partial reconstruction of black shop workers’ participation in the
1922 conflict and thus their relationships with each other, white unionists,
the federal government, and their broader community. In 1922, black shop
workers took exceptional risks, on both sides of the strike divide, at a time
when the prospect of progress was fast receding. Their efforts underline the
influence of black wartime protest and activism, the unique aspects of labor
and race relations in the shops, and the rooted life led by many black shopmen
and their families. This history has the potential to generate fresh
investigation of the roots and nature of the civil rights movement in shop
towns such as Marshall, a center of 1960s-era civil rights activism in Texas.</p>

<p>□  Mapping The Crisis: Du Bois and the Small Scale
In its early days in the nineteen-teens, the NAACP’s monthly magazine, The
Crisis, was a multimedia, polygeneric publication containing long-form
reporting, editorials, photography, fiction, poetry, and other kinds of
content. One component of W.E.B. Du Bois’ journal was a monthly column that
aggregated news clippings and accounts of smaller-scale events. Titled first
“Along the Color Line” and later “The Horizon,” the miscellany contains
events under headings ranging from “Education” to “Crime,” from “The
Ghetto” to “Social Uplift,” from “Music and Arts” to “The War.”
Most entries are tagged with a location or several locations, and the dates of
the issues tag them in time as well.</p>

<p>I propose displaying or screening (whichever applies best) a digital humanities
project that I have developed to engage with the miscellany. Developed through
a fellowship from the University of Washington’s Simpson Center for the
Humanities, and in collaboration with UW’s Mapping Social Movements website,
this project, titled “A Year on the Horizon,” took each of the hundreds of
entries per month and projected them on a map. After creating a database of
more than a thousand entries from “The Horizon,” I used mapping software to
create an interactive visualization of each month’s entries covering a year
from summer 1916 to summer 1917 (a range that will be expanded in further
drafts).</p>

<p>“A Year on the Horizon” is a micro-scale, qualitative complement to the
quantitative history of the NAACP that Mapping American Social Movements
already holds. The grand scale of the rise of the NAACP described by maps and
charts that count the rise in membership and the increase in the number of
branches provide mutual context for one year of the everyday life of the
community it represented. “The Horizon” vividly illustrates collective and
individual triumphs and tragedies. Reading the entries feels like opening a
window to another time—but the more one reads, the more it feels like a
mirror, reflecting 21st Century social justice issues.</p>

<p>In the January 1916 issue of The Crisis, Du Bois explained his process for
selecting cuttings for “The Horizon” and other sections of the paper: “To
preserve that balance of judgment and foresight on the one hand which will make
the magazine popular, and on the other hand make it a real force for education
and uplift—this is no easy task and calls for unusual ability and
clairvoyance if it is well done.” (135). He ends this editorial by reminding
his readers “remember that this is not a mere magazine—it is a magazine
with a purpose.” “A Year on the Horizon” attempts to honor the ability
and clairvoyance of Du Bois and his collaborators by making it easier to
access, read, and sort through the history contained in “The Horizon.”</p>

<p>□  Police Power as Political Power: The New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association and the 1966 Civilian Review Board Referendum
When in 1966, the new mayor of New York City, John Lindsay, introduced private
citizens into the process to take and investigate complaints against the
police, the local police union and its allies waged a successful campaign to
remove them via referendum and amend the city’s charter to prohibit civilians
from serving on any police review board. In analyzing the review board
referendum, a new form of police power becomes apparent – political. While
there are many volumes on police brutality, scholars have not recognized the
more subtle forms of domination police are able to exercise. Books critical of
the NYPD focus on violence and methods of coercion, as well as falsified
charges, lying and social repression. These allegations are well documented,
but they do not encompass all of the power the police department has deployed.
In its effort to destroy the new review board in 1966, the police union, the
Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, vowed to spend its $1.5 million treasury
on advertising. Working closely with a veteran Madison Avenue advertising
executive and an external firm, the PBA was able to bring out white voters to
defeat a liberal measure, the first time a progressive matter had lost at the
polls in the city in decades. Running a racially coded campaign designed to
incite fear of crime in white voters, the PBA, with no prior experience in
politicking, was more successful than it had anticipated. In less than six
months, the twenty thousand strong PBA was able to muster 1.3 million voters to
ban civilian oversight of police and repudiate one of Mayor Lindsay’s core
programs. Police power in New York extends beyond how we commonly think of it.</p> </p>
