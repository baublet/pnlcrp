<blockquote>
    <p>Paper #1:</p>

<p>“The Present Slavery—The Coming Freedom”: Organized Labor and the Civil
War Metaphor in the Gilded Age</p>

<p>Dyer Daniel Lum construed Decoration Day less as a day of collective mourning
than one of collective action.                                            Taking a
“wider
view
of the
field” on
Decoration Day 1885, Lum, who had served as an officer in the 14th New York
Cavalry, maintained that while United States soldiers such as himself had
enlisted and fought the Civil War for principles of human liberty and the
preservation of the Union, the war’s disastrous results included “the
enrichment of army contractors; financial speculators in national necessities;
the centralization of authority; the creation of monied aristocracy; and the
tendency of industrial enterprises to concentrate into monopolies.”  Although
the war had enlarged the bounds of human freedom by freeing and “embracing
the southern slaves as equals,” the aims of the Civil War were not anywhere
near finished, Lum concluded.  A “new war cry” was necessary to achieve
genuine mental, political, and economic freedom.  Having become a stanch
anarcho-syndicalist activist and publisher and Labor Reform Party candidate
after the war, Lum’s war memory was that of an unfinished revolution against
material inequality.  “In preserving the union we created a new union—of
capital.”    </p>

<p>By late April 1886, one day before a turn of events in Chicago’s Haymarket
Square and the International Workers’ Day commemoration that followed altered
forever the destinies of both Lum and the entire American labor movement, Lum
published a piece entitled “American Workingmen are called upon to Arm
Themselves.”                                            Insisting that peaceable
and
electoral
politics
were
necessary
but insufficient, this “Old Soldier’s…Cry of Warning” proposed that
American workers could either choose to be either “slaves” or “free
men,” but that the latter would require directly confronting the extortive
force of the Money Power and the “arbitrary states of the markets.” 
Indeed, in an about-face from the Civil War, the legions of bayonets now
belonged to private capital and workingmen were left unto themselves to stake
their own “emancipation.”  Positing direct agitation as very much within
the American republican and individualist traditions, he called on workers to
“Be your own man…Seek your own self” in order to undermine their
“economic masters.”  “Personal independence,” Lum explained, was not
subjugation by the fickleness of the invisible hand, but the “right to
labor” as a social right.  Contrasting capital aggregation and the
“fixed” status of the working classes with the producerist ideal of the
Civil War era, he probed, “Do you not realize…times have changed since our
civil war, if your memory goes back beyond that event?” </p>

<p>This paper examines how Gilded Age workingmen used the language, symbols, and
identity of the Civil War in oratory and official literature to imagine a
“second Emancipation Proclamation.”  Indeed, the conflict of 1861-1865, and
chattel slavery and black emancipation in particular, proved a model for how
black and white workingmen imagined, dialogued, and strategized about their own
class and material conditions.                                      Knights of Labor,
Chicago
anarchists,
Federationists all consistently evoked the memory and rhetoric of the war
era--“battle,” “master,” “slave,” “emancipation,”
“abolition,”--often through formal and informal “Grand Army” and
“Blue and the Gray” auxiliaries.  Dyer Lum and others saw themselves as
metaphorical soldiers in an army of human liberation.  “We are, or should be,
all soldiers in one army advancing to the conquest of one sole aim,” resolved
one worker, avowing that the “different divisions of the grand army of
labor” unify for “the struggle for the emancipation of the working
class…as a successive series of skirmished.”  Workingmen of various
organizations and parties widely employed this “labor-veteran approach”
because the war’s severity and urgency still reverberated through the public
consciousness.                                            Indeed, white workingmen,
especially
Union
veterans, used
a
familiar martial language of slavery and emancipation--a message of radical
change--even as they moved away from labor radicalism and toward respectability
politics.  </p>

<p>Paper #2:</p>

<p>Joined in Struggle: Civil War Veterans and the Search for Stability in
America’s West, 1865-1930</p>

<p>The surrender of Confederate forces in the spring of 1865 marked the end of the
war for most Union soldiers. These newly minted veterans from all backgrounds
and walks of life returned to the homes they had left years before. Some,
suffering from lingering disabilities, struggled to find stable employment and
lived the remained of their lives in tenuous financial circumstances, relying
on charity and federal aid for survival. Others flourished, parlaying their
military service into successful careers and long-term financial stability for
themselves and their families. Ever aware of opportunity, many veterans looked,
migrating across the continent to California where they set down deep roots in
new communities that grew there in the second half of the 19th century. </p>

<p>San Bernardino County emerged as an important transportation hub and citrus
community during the later half of the 19th and early decades of the 20th
century as men and women flooded west. Civil War veterans played a vital role
to the growth of this community, first as pioneers and settlers and then as
lawyers, doctors, farmers, and politicians. Men who fought to preserve the
Union mustered out of military service and undertook a new and arduous task:
community building. This paper focuses on two complimentary narratives. First,
the social, political, and economic growth of Southern California and second,
the role of Union veterans within these communities and as they became part of
the great march of American progress that occurred during the decades after the
war. </p>

<p>Broadly, the role that Civil War veterans as part of community building that
occurred in the latter half of the 19th century in an understudied, yet
important avenue by which we may expand our understanding of bot the impact of
war on these men and their families and the place of these veterans within
their communities. Traditionally, historians have approached the study of
veterans from the same analytical framework. Utilizing letters, memoirs, and
published accounts, historians have linked veterans together as part of a
shared post-war experience in which these men were, inevitably, disconnected
from their local communities. Their status as veterans, in other words, made
them intrinsically different from other Americans and created a unique, but
segregated, post-war existence for the men who donned blue in defense of the
Union. They were, as one historian has noted, men “set apart” from American
society. This paper will examine the ways in which a new methodological
approach to the study of Civil War Veterans--focusing on one community and
delving into the comparative experiences of over 400 men who migrated west and
settled in one geographic area—can expand our historical understanding of the
social, political, and economic place of veterans in the west during
America’s rebirth in the post-Civil War era.</p>

<p>Paper #3</p>

<p>The Grand Army of the Social Republic: Civil War Veterans and the Making of
American Socialism</p>

<p>The struggle for the survival of the Federal Union in 1861-1865 became a
struggle for the victory of “Free Labor,” though those who struggled on its
behalf understood this to mean different things.  While ultimately, “the
Second American Revolution” would give rise to a new birth of capitalism,
many participants hoped for a different outcome, as reflected in the thousands
of signatures urging radical land reform and redistribution during the course
of this national crisis.</p>

<p>Some of these played a decisive role in the formation of the first socialist
efforts in the U.S.  Some had a great deal of prominent, such as Richard J.
Hinton, who officered black soldiers in the West as part of that triracial
Federal force there or Charles Matchett, a socialist presidential candidate
before Gene Debs.  More deeply, perhaps, we will examine some of the rank and
file figures whose presence certainly shaped the actual feel of socialism at
the local and state level.</p> </p>
