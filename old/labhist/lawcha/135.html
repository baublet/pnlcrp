<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>As LAWCHA comes to Seattle, the site of the historic 1919 general strike, we
propose a roundtable that will assess the state of the field of labor and
working-class history in the North American West. Labor and the struggles of
working people have long been a focus of western history, from the 1960s gold
rush studies of Rodman Paul to the birth of the “new western history” in
the 1980s. In the last two decades, however, labor and working-class history
has come to play an increasingly minor role in the broader field of western
history. Western labor history panels are scarce at national conferences, fewer
Ph.D. students tackle western labor history topics in their dissertations, and
(despite some recent award-winning books) monographs on western labor history
are few and far between. The panelists for this session, all established
western labor historians, will address the decline of the field by suggesting
new ways in which labor and working-class history can offer a critical
framework for understanding the region's past. Many of the panelists focus on
workers’ migration and mobility and they will explore how western historians
can use the conceptual frameworks of borderlands and transnational history for
analyzing the region’s labor history.  Panelists will also explore how
interjecting labor into western history can recast regional narratives of race
and gender.</p> </p>
