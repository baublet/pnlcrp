<h4>Jurisdictional Conflicts and the Battle for Canadian Bank Workers in the 1970s</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>To contribute to the conference theme of “Scales of Struggle” and the
sub-themes of “Borders and Coalitions” and “Struggling for Justice,”
this paper will examine the conflicts that occurred within the Canadian labour
movement in the 1970s over union organizing in the banking industry. This
period witnessed the greatest surge in bank worker unionization in Canadian
history. Initially, the unions and labour organizations involved worked
separately but alongside one another. Things changed in 1977 though, when two
independent unions successfully challenged a federal labour board ruling on
single-branch bargaining units. With branch certification now possible, large
unions and labour organizations that had failed or not bothered to organize
bank workers turned their attention to the banks. Bitter inter-union battles
soon erupted, most notably between the country’s largest labour federation
– the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) – and a small feminist union – the
Service, Office, and Retail Workers’ Union of Canada (SORWUC). As unions
expended time, energy, and resources debating who had jurisdiction over bank
employees, the banks waged a steady war against unionization in the branches,
in the media, and in the courts and, in the end, emerged victorious. 
   The labour movement’s inability and unwillingness to overcome ideological
differences and jurisdictional issues played a key role in the failure of the
drives. As such, the battle for Canadian bank workers that occurred in the
1970s serves as a useful case study of why jurisdictional conflicts occur and
how they harm workers and the labour movement. SORWUC’s status as an
independent feminist union focused on organizing women workers in a variety of
sectors positioned it as radically different from most other unions and helped
the union organize bank workers. Its independence, ideology, and success,
however, also led CLC officials to view the feminist union as a threat. Rather
than support SORWUC and build on its initial progress, CLC leaders chose to
establish a new bank workers’ organizing committee, to isolate the
independent union, and to defend representatives and affiliates who attempted
to undermine it. Without support from the CLC, SORWUC leaders felt unable to
counter the banks’ efforts to thwart unionization; the union withdrew from
negotiations and cancelled its certifications. The CLC continued with its
campaign, but the congress’s strategy proved less successful than SORWUC’s;
the banks’ anti-union behaviour compounded matters. Analyzing the conflict
that occurred in the 1970s bank drives thus highlights the problems with
jurisdiction and top-down organizing and the importance of labour movement
solidarity and support for new ways of organizing.</p> </p>
