<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Woody Guthrie, born in 1912, fled the depression and the dustbowl of Oklahoma
and migrated to the skid row of Los Angeles in 1937. He started a musical
career that would produce hundreds of songs, among them some of America’s
best-known folk ballads. Singing and talking to fellow immigrants through an LA
radio program, he also made his way into the camps of migrant workers and
identified his music with the American working class. Coming from a racist
family background, he met African Americans and Latinos and became associated
with the Popular Front of the Communist Party and became a strident
anti-racist. John Handcox, born in Arkansas in 1904, grew up on a
self-sufficient farm but his family hurtled down into poverty during the boll
weevil and cotton crisis of the 1920s. When a team of runaway mules killed his
father, John became head of a large family. Jim Crow laws and practices,
lynching, and sharecropping combined to place him and his family into a deeply
oppressed class of black agricultural workers. Bin 1936, he helped to organize
the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, a remarkable bi-racial organized led by
Socialist Party activists. Run out of Arkansas by a lynch mob after an STFU
strike, John produced a flood or poems and songs for the movement. He became
the “Sharecroppers’ Troubadour,” and like Woody Guthrie on the West
Coast, his music helped to lift working-class organizing, but equally
important, created a legacy of labor music that has infused American culture
ever since. Guthrie and Handcox left behind memories of the Great Depression
and multi-racial and multi-national working-class organizing that continues to
inspire people to this day. </p>

<p>One cannot do justice to either of these singer-songwriter stories without
performance that goes deeply down into the heart of their lives and their work.
Darryl Holter, a Labor Studies scholar and teacher and now an independent
business person, scholar, and singer, has researched, recorded and produced
Guthrie’s seminal work, in Woody Guthrie LA, 1937-1941, and a remarkable CD
by the same name. Michael Honey, a historian of African American and Labor
History at the University of  Washington Tacoma, wrote Sharecroppers’
Troubadour: John L. Handcox and the African-American Song Tradition (Palgrave
MacMillan, 2013), and has co-written songs with Handcox and set a number of his
poems to music. Holter and Honey will tell and sing about these working-class
artists helped to forge a musical literature of protest that blazed a path for
subsequent generations of singers from Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, to Pete
Seeger and Sweet Honey in the Rock. These singing and song-writing radicals
helped to ignite the organizing of the Popular Front era, and left an artistic 
legacy the informs struggles for justice today that will be explored through
story and song in this performative presentation.</p> </p>
