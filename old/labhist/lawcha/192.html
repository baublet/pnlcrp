    <p>□  Socialism Before Sanders: Channeling “A Mighty River
From the second half of the 1930s onward, socialists made the transition from
independent political action under the banner of the Socialist Party of America
(SP) to an embrace of the Democratic Party as an electoral vehicle. Their
utopian aspirations faded, and they embraced social democracy, or what one
commentator called “mature” socialism. Socialists no longer insisted there
was a “correct” road to socialism. They recognized that capitalism was a
malleable economic structure that could be made responsive to the demands of
working people. The movement of socialists into the ranks of the Democratic
Party confounds claims that socialism failed in the United States because
socialists were too ideological in their outlook and could not accept the
pragmatic demands required in politics. Perhaps the SP was too dogmatic, rigid,
and unwilling to accept the demands of participation in a political system that
required compromising ideals to achieve power and bring change. Ultimately,
however, American socialists proved they could compromise. They adopted a
pragmatic approach to political action and achieved some success outside of
their one-time party.</p>

<p>□  Organising Community: Hotel and Restaurant Unionisation and
Community-based Radicalism in 1930s Minneapolis
This paper examines intersections between community struggles and unionism by
focusing on the attempts of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) to
organise in Minneapolis in the late 1930s and early 1940s. HERE Local 665
organised on an industrial basis the miscellaneous workers who held low-status
jobs within the hotel and restaurant industry, such as maids, kitchen and
laundry staff and cafeteria workers, positions that were mostly held by women
and African-Americans in a famously white city. Unionists spread 665 both
through tactics of salting within the workplace, and through a nexus of
communities that had been built up by radicals and ethnic groups throughout the
1930s. 665 would then contribute back to these broader struggles, using its
position on the Farmer-Labor Association and the AFL Central Labor Body of
Minneapolis to press for left policy and support the nascent Civil Rights
movement. In examining the history of 665, I will bring out the often complex
relationships between race, gender, community and union organisation in 1930s
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>This paper is part of a broader project focusing on the development of
third-party labor politics in Minnesota. The Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party held
office from 1930-38, and is thus widely regarded as the most successful third
party in US history. My work seeks to reconceptualise the relationship between
the party and broader radical movements in Minnesota at that time. I argue that
it was this connection with outside radical communities that provided a base
for a working-class political organisation. This chapter, on 665, will provide
a case study of this relationship. By focusing on a service workers union,
dominated by women and African-Americans, I seek to broaden the image of
working-class people who participated in radical politics. While labor
historians have lately put considerable focus on service work, the image of the
Farmer-Labor Party remains resolutely traditional; the (white male) producerist
manufacturing worker to complement the (white male) producerist farmer. This
paper seeks to contribute both to a new conception of working-class politics,
and to uncover potentialities for connections between local community activism,
labor, and political organisation.</p>

<p>□  Labor’s Role in a ‘Tax the Rich’ Ballot Measure Campaign:  The
Lessons of California’s Success Story
In November 2012 the California electorate passed Proposition 30, which levied
the biggest increases on the top marginal state income tax rates since World
War II. These revenues halted the deep cuts to public education and services
brought on by a combination of the Great Recession and years of anti-tax,
anti-government rhetoric and policy. The passage of Prop 30 demonstrated that a
labor-community coalition with the right messaging and a serious investment of
resources could overcome the perception that progressive tax policies were
simply not possible to enact. While part of the successful effort relied on the
changing demographics of the California electorate, the more important lesson
for labor forces to consider in other states is that you can’t get there if
you don’t try. California provides a case study in how the convergence of
growing economic inequality, and insights initially provided by the Occupy
movement and reinforced by the Sanders campaign, provide the context today for
a labor-backed renewal of fair tax solutions to the crisis of public sector
financing.</p> </p>
