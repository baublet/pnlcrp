<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Photography itself is industrial labor. Only occasionally has the camera been
turned on the worker as a subject of importance. The members of this panel want
to examine how work (and its absence) were been depicted photographically in
the twentieth century. </p>

<p>The camera changed the landscape of cultural production. Photography as
mechanical reproduction became part of the industrial assembly line from design
through production to marketing and advertising. Visual communication became
dominant in the twentieth century, especially a style of visual storytelling
that featured careful composition by photographers close to their subjects and
presented as unmanipulated, “straight” images, which could be confused with
unmediated reality and thus evidence of the veracity of what was depicted. This
form of communication became especially important in the period dominated by
glossy photomagazines, but the style originated somewhere and carried on,
inspiring diverse innovation. In this panel, Kate Sampsell-Willmann will
endeavor to define what is meant by the term “social documentary” and
outline its intellectual boundaries as initiated in Lewis Hine’s “social
photography” of child labor. Carol Quirke will present her recent research on
the photography of Arthur Leipzig, who represented workers in deeply textured
documentary photographs for major corporate clients, and Ed Slavishak will turn
to Appalachia in mid-century at the time when the region was in economic crisis
to reinterpret work outside of employment.</p> </p>
