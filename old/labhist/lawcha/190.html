<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Illegal People, Legal Goods: Workers, the Auto Industry and Commuting at
the Local Scale in the 1920s Detroit-Windsor Borderland
“Illegal People, Legal Goods” examines America’s northern border to
explore how workers and employers in two nations negotiated new border laws to
shape immigration and trade patterns in America’s industrial core during the
1920s. The paper will trace the shift from open border to regulation in
Detroit, Michigan, a city that represented America’s third industrial center,
fourth city in population, and a key borderland with Canada. Before the U.S.
passed immigration laws in 1921 and 1924, twenty thousand commuters crossed
daily from Windsor, Canada to the factories of Detroit, while major automobile
companies ferried parts across the same river for assembly in Windsor branches.
To the horror of American employers and Canadian business interests, new
American immigration laws threatened to regulate the international border in
new ways. Over the next several years, unions, employers, and politicians on
both sides of the border waged a battle over the commuting issue that raised
concerns over the endurance of free trade, the threat of dangerous foreigners,
and friendly relations between two North American nations.</p>

<p>This paper takes up the fraught issue of Canadian commuting to reveal how
unions, employers, and two governments negotiated border crossing as an
Anglo-Saxon privilege, making the border between “desirable” Anglo-Saxon
North Americans and “undesirable” ethnic Europeans more important than the
international boundary. After 1924, the Detroit Federation of Labor (DFL)
capitalized on a growing anxiety over foreignness and border crossing to launch
a campaign against the twenty thousand Canadian commuters who crossed into
Detroit daily for work. Union efforts not only angered American employers and
Canadian business interests, but they outraged Canada’s Foreign Office. Eager
to avoid a clash with its northern neighbor or major automobile corporations,
in 1927, the U.S. Department of Labor negotiated an agreement with Canada that
allowed Anglo Canadians and British nationals to keep commuter cards, yet
restricted commuters of foreign origin regardless of their Canadian
citizenship. U.S.-Canadian negotiations also allowed major employers to
maintain and even grow Windsor branch plants, factories with notoriously low
pay and poor conditions. The result, which mollified the DFL and the Canadian
state, set a precedent for excluding individuals on the basis of ethnicity in
the borderland region, while ensuring that the border would remain open to the
trade of goods.</p>

<p>□  The Elusive Postwar Boom: Metro-Detroit Autoworkers, 1945-1960</p>

<p>There was no boom for Detroit autoworkers in the fifteen years after World War
II. Recessions, automation, decentralization, and the collapse of independent
automakers in are part of the story, but materials shortages (including during
the Korean War), steel strikes, copper strikes, supplier strikes, wildcats,
overproduction (especially in 1955), hot weather, cold weather, plant
explosions, age, race, and gender discrimination, and the inability of
autoworkers to afford new cars were constant contributors to this instability.
No one in the 1950s—whether ordinary autoworkers, union leaders, auto company
executives, business analysts, or local shopkeepers—thought that the decade
was marked by steady work, improving wages, or anything resembling
predictability for autoworkers. This presentation would be drawn from my book
manuscript currently under contract and under review with the University of
Illinois Press.</p>

<p>□  “The Cause and Cure of Strikes”: The Promise of Postwar Social Science
in Socialist Thought
Socialist and social theorist Stuart Chase included a chapter on “The Cause
and Cure of Strikes” in his 1948 study of the state of the social sciences,
"The Proper Study of Mankind." Industrial conflict was just one of many social
problems that Chase and others hoped may soon be “solved” as the social
sciences advanced to form a science of human relations that would rival the
precision and accomplishments of the technical sciences. This paper will show
how a broad spectrum of postwar socialists and liberal reformers believed that
an objective and rational science of human relations could render the politics
of social reform moot and usher in an era of social harmony. This movement
included non-political reformers like B.F. Skinner, whose 1948 utopian novel
"Walden Two" is perhaps the most popular example of the optimism surrounding
postwar social science, but this paper will focus primarily on how such ideas
animated socialists and the labor movement. In particular, I will discuss how
this movement influenced the trade union philosophy and socialism of United
Auto Workers’ President Walter Reuther. The ideas in this paper serve as the
ideological and cultural foundation for my larger study of Walter Reuther’s
UAW and the social sciences.</p> </p>
