<h4>Turn of the Century Technê: Anarchist Newspapers as Social Media in Los Angeles, Borderlands, and Mexico in the Early Twentieth Century</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The vast cultural production of the transnational radical community in Los
Angeles, California and the borderlands is exceeded by the overlapping network
of individual and organizational connections that sustained it. By the early
twentieth century the shrinking of space and time through technological change
facilitated the ability of anarchists to turn a global movement into reality.
Through personal networks, mass meetings, and print media anarchists in Los
Angeles formulated the terms of their struggle, coordinated their actions,
broadcasted their views to a broader tier of supporters and sympathizers, and
attempted to spread their message to the public at large. Anarchist newspapers
printed in Los Angeles, such as Regeneración, maintained a nearly-global
readership as improvements in transportation technologies lowered the cost of
international mail. During this period the leftist press as a whole fostered an
imagined global community of radicals, which served as the base for expressions
of solidarity. At moments of local crisis, usually during a strike or the
imprisonment of participants, organizers sent letters and telegrams
communicating appeals for financial contributions, and supporters responded. </p>

<p>Newspapers functioned as the most public manifestation of a layered radical
community spanning individual association, organizational solidarities, and the
printed page. In this sense, anarchist newspapers in the early twentieth
century functioned as “social media” in a remarkably similar way as digital
social media today. Further, the necessity of using mail delivery service to
the transport newspapers and letters across distance became their biggest
weakness. Most governments around the world—democratic or not—relied on
their control of mail service to refuse delivery of publications deemed
objectionable and to monitor personal communications. Governments controlled
this crucial piece of the dissemination infrastructure. This paper will provide
an examination of a movement that remained predominantly analogue in its
communication technologies, but global in its reach.</p> </p>
