<h4>Labor’s Role in a ‘Tax the Rich’ Ballot Measure Campaign: The Lessons of California’s Success Story</h4>

<em>Fred Glass</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In November 2012 the California electorate passed Proposition 30, which levied
the biggest increases on the top marginal state income tax rates since World
War II.  These revenues halted the deep cuts to public education and services
brought on by a combination of the Great Recession and years of anti-tax,
anti-government rhetoric and policy.  The passage of Prop 30 demonstrated that
a labor-community coalition with the right messaging and a serious investment
of resources could overcome the perception that progressive tax policies were
simply not possible to enact.  While part of the successful effort relied on
the changing demographics of the California electorate, the more important
lesson for labor forces to consider in other states is that you can’t get
there if you don’t try.  California provides a case study in how the
convergence of growing economic inequality, and insights initially provided by
the Occupy movement and reinforced by the Sanders campaign, provide the context
today for a labor-backed renewal of fair tax solutions to the crisis of public
sector financing.</p> </p>
