<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel provides a diverse overview of issues and experiences facing
laborers in and from the Pacific, who have toiled in difficult but essential
manual labor jobs for the growth and protection of the United States throughout
the twentieth century. Starting with Roneva Keel’s study of early twentieth
century sugar production in the U.S. West and the Philippines, she explores how
the transpacific migrations of workers highlight the ways in which the
colonization of Hawai‘i and the Philippines was tied to processes of settler
colonialism in the West. In Holger Droessler’s paper, he focuses on Pacific
Islander war workers during World War Two. Faced with pervasive racism and
demeaning work conditions, these laborers managed to create new opportunities
both for themselves and for their home societies. And finally in JoAnna
Poblete’s essay, she examines the variable labor standards that were created
in the unincorporated territory of American Sāmoa and supported by the U.S.
federal government. Debates surrounding the minimum wage issue in American
Sāmoa has loomed over the tuna canning industry on-island since the 1950s and
culminated in major shifts to policies and jobs in 2009. All three papers
examine some aspect of workers laboring under liminal and often invisible
statuses as non-citizens, while being pressured to conform to continental U.S.
expectations, standards, ideologies, and authority.</p> </p>
