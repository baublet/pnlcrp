<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>With the vast majority of its population speaking French, Québec represents a
peculiar case in North America. This situation has deeply influenced the
development of ideas and practices on its territory, including workers,
nationalist and student movement. The impact of this geographical and
historical specificity is also reflected in the province’s political and
national history, which has long emphasised the exceptional nature of
Québec’s development compared to English-speaking Canada and, more largely,
North America. While such tendencies has often produced closed
historiographical debates, social historians interested in working class
history and social movements history have shown a greater appreciation for
wider, more encompassing spatial scales. Importantly, they recognise that
social movements in Québec are in constant dialogue with other movements in
Europe and other part of North America. This panel proposes to question social
movements and activism in Québec by taking into account its transnational
dimension in order to see Québec’s through an international prism.
Paper 1
On May 1, 1906, more than 1,000 people took the streets in Montreal to mark
International Worker’s Day. The event had considerable impact on local
politics. For the first time, socialists and anarchists demonstrated in
Canada's metropolis, red flags flying. But far from being a strictly local
event, this action was part of a wider mobilization straddling Europe and North
America. Through this presentation, we will try to understand the links between
Montreal activists and transnational militant networks. This analysis will
allow us to better understand the complexity of their commitment and the scope
of their demands, while shedding new light on the people of various ethnic and
political backgrounds who were involved in this demonstration.
Paper 2
As in many other Western societies, Quebec witnessed a feminist resurgence at
the turning of the 70s. While access to abortion and contraception are
generally retained as the most marking struggles of this second wave of
feminism, several groups developed, during this same period, discourses and
activism around the issue of housework. In Quebec, feminists demanded a
recognition of the social value of housework, with some even going on to build
connections with the international movement Wages for Housework. For other
feminists, it was more through socialization, by the collective sharing of
housework, that women would be liberated from the burden of housework. Finally,
certain women’s organizations focused on government reforms in order to
reduce the financial insecurity of mothers and housewives. These debates were
all influenced by the intellect of American, Italian, French and English
feminists. We wish to reflect on this period in Quebec’s feminist movement,
by highlighting this aforementioned intellectual input on Quebecker feminist
activism.
Paper 3
During the Great Depression Era, as unemployment take critical proportions
never seen before in Canada, unemployed people put forward a rich repertoire of
individual and collective protests. At the time, no Canadian wide measures
exist to help the working class cope with unemployment. Relief and public works
are administered by municipalities. In such a context, this paper offer to
study Montreal’s example to illustrate that beyond appearances of a local
based unemployed movement, that emerge out of necessity, in reality, it
possesses larger ramifications that interweave at different geographic scales,
from Montreal’s working class neighborhoods to the international stage,
passing by provincial and federal level. Those extents have many repercussions
at different degrees on protest forms, claims, gender relations, ethnicities,
religions, class formation and solidarities.</p> </p>
