<p>□  Drawn to Change: Working-Class Comics as Activist Story-Telling
Sean Carleton, Mount Royal University/Graphic History Collective</p>

<p>How we choose to tell stories about the past shapes our understanding of
ourselves and the power we possess to change the present and the future.
Recounting the events of the past, then, is not a neutral endeavor; it is
profoundly political. Taking inspiration from such activists as bell hooks and
Howard Zinn, the Graphic History Collective (GHC) – a group of artists,
writers, and historical researchers – blends the traditions of “people’s
history” and labor and working-class history with comics. Overall, our aim is
to use the accessible medium of comics to tell stories about labor history in
ways that can inspire workers to use the lessons of the past as a resource to
inform contemporary struggles for social change. To contribute to the
conference theme of “Scales of Struggle: Communities, Movements, and Global
Connections” and the sub-themes of “Struggling for Justice” and "Public
Work of Labor History," this paper will explore the work of the GHC, focusing
on our most recent project, a comics anthology: Drawn to Change: Graphic
Histories of Working-Class Struggle (Between the Lines, 2016). Speakers from
the GHC will discuss the importance and value of presenting labor histories in
accessible and creative formats, paying particular attention to the production
process and how it opens up opportunities for building community, reaching
broad audiences, and organizing in new and relevant ways. We would also like to
mount an art exhibit during the conference. The exhibit will showcase samples
from Drawn to Change and enable conference attendees to view some of the work
discussed during our paper.</p> </p>
