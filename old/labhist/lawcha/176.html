<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This": Representation and
Consciousness of Labor and the Working Class in American Musical Theatre,
1945-1975
As a relatively elite stage form, “proletarianized” through development of
wide-release film versions, musical theatre occupies an odd space in the
spectrum of artistic production, straddling the boundary between “high art”
and “popular art.” Workers are sometimes colorful background or fetishized,
exoticized and sentimentalized objects of bourgeois gaze; in other instances,
they are more authentic reflections of working-class values. Popular forms of
music, dance, fashion and language, often with working-class roots, have been
integral to musical theatre form and structure. Being both a product of and a
producer of popular culture, musical theatre offers a window into the role of
working-class representations and culture in the broader artistic, commercial
and political culture of our society.</p>

<p>If the images, sounds, forms and values of workers are to be represented in
art, whether as specifically working-class expressions or as appropriation for
a dominant-class audience, workers have a right of ownership to those
representations and an interest—a class interest—in attempting to interpret
and understand them. That understanding is dependent upon an aggressive
insistence that artistic works that depict working people answer to a
working-class critique.</p>

<p>□  Workers’ Struggles on Stage: Australian Radical Theatre 
This paper considers connections within international left cultural activity by
introducing the New Theatre in Australia, which has seen very little academic
attention. Taking inspiration from the New Theatre of the USA and the Unity
Theatre in the UK, the New Theatre employed a novel mix of conventional theatre
forms, experimental performative styles and communist theories of ‘art as a
weapon’ in their presentation of left-wing theatre within a society that was
largely resistant to their broader political ideals. Their work and
organisation were avowedly working class, and support from the Communist Party
of Australia and left-wing unions was vital. Drawing from primary research and
oral history interviews, the paper highlights their struggle for industrial
justice in a marriage of culture and union activism in Australia. To illustrate
this intersection, a 1952 performance of The Candy Store, written by an
American activist, Bernard Rubin, is discussed. What makes the performance of
this play notable is the location and audience: 1500 feet down a mineshaft to
coal miners staging a stay-in strike.</p>

<p>□  Representing Teachers: Labor and Liberalism in Bel Kaufman’s Up the Down
Staircase: This paper situates the explosion of teachers' labor militancy
within a broader
cultural conversation about public educators’ role in building the so-called
Great Society. The paper centers on the work of Bel Kaufman, who drew on her
experience as a New York City teacher in her 1965 novel Up the Down Staircase,
which formed the basis for the 1967 Hollywood film of the same name. Kaufman
became a prominent ally of teachers unions around the country from the
mid-1960s forward, and her book articulated experiences and perspectives that
resonated with millions of other teachers. The paper draws on new archival
research in Kaufman’s papers, exploring the ways in which her novel became a
touchstone for broader public reckoning with the workplace politics of public
education.</p> </p>
