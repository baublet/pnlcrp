<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This roundtable will provide a space to discuss the variety of issues related
to the organizing of contingent faculty into labor unions, and the way that
labor unions can change the relationship between tenure track and non-tenure
track faculty. Rather than presenting the issues of contingent faculty as
monolithic, the roundtable will identify the different kinds of institutional
positions that contingent faculty occupy in contemporary higher education, and
the different kinds of organizing strategies and collective bargaining issues
that emerge from trying to develop solidarity across disciplinary and
professional positions. </p>

<p>•                    Trevor Griffey, the roundtable moderator, will open the
conversation
by
identifying the diversity of non-tenure track faculty experiences, and the
complex roles that unions can play in both ameliorating and reinforcing
inequality between faculty of different ranks. He will also moderate the
question and answer period.</p>

<p>•                    Lori Blewett will discuss the organizing of non-tenure
track
and
tenure
track faculty into a single labor union at The Evergreen State College, and
draw from the experience of The United Faculty of Evergreen (AFT-NEA) to
identify benefits and challenges of developing solidarity across faculty rank. </p>

<p>•                    Larry Cushnie will draw from his experience with Faculty
Forward
(SEIU)
at Seattle University to discuss the challenges of teaching at Catholic
institutions that have a social justice mission but rely upon contingent
faculty labor and refuse to recognize or bargain with faculty labor unions.  </p>

<p>•                    Richard Moore will draw from his experience with AFT Local
6486
at
the
University of Washington to discuss the ways in which faculty labor unions are
essential to providing meaningful shared governance and increased job security
to faculty in English language learning programs and university extension
programs.  </p>

<p>•                    Miranda Merklein will draw from her experience with New
Faculty
Majority to critically reflect on the role that non-profit organizations can
play in raising consciousness, building power, and improving the working
conditions for faculty who teach off the tenure track.                               </p>

<p>The roundtable will be followed by a discussion in which members of the
audience will be encouraged to ask follow up questions as well as draw from
their own experience to help identify some of the many issues involved with
organizing contingent faculty today.</p> </p>
