<h4>Labour in the Global Carnival Against Capital</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Though not the first of such events, the ‘Battle of Seattle’ late in 1999
was the seen as the coming out party for the anti-corporate movement. Where was
labour in this important new movement? Did unions participate in blockading the
citadels of corporate global power? Evidence from case-studies of four of the
‘summit-hopping’ episodes (Seattle November-December 1999, Melbourne
September 2000, Quebec City April 2001 and Genoa July 2001) suggests strong
working-class involvement, especially of white-collar workers from the public
sector, and important contributions from union activists and particular radical
unions as organizations, white-collar and blue-collar, public and private.
However, in some cases trade union officialdom at higher levels preferred union
contingents keep a safe distance from centres of action. Such reticence did not
present the union movement in the best light to anti-corporate activists; and
it revealed significant tensions within unions between militant,
class-conscious activists and more co-opted and conservative officials.</p> </p>
