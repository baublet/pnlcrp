<h4>“Regardless of Color” The American Socialist Movement and African Americans between 1876 and 1890</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Labour historians such as Philip S. Foner argue that during the Gilded Age the
American socialist movement - especially the Socialist Labor Party – was
“oblivious” to the problem of race discrimination. Socialists, according to
Foner, failed to understand that African Americans’ reality of discrimination
was structurally engrained in the social fabric of the ex-Confederate States,
and that, consequently, it required socialists to work out exceptional measures
in order to fight for their aim of universal equality (Foner 1977). 
My paper challenges this orthodoxy, critically engaging with scholars such as
Foner in order to shed new light on our understanding of the relationship
between socialism and race at the turn of the century. By critically examining
German-language socialist sources - something that is lacking from current
studies - I will track down debates on the race question amongst SLP members,
explaining the different positions within the party. Socialists such as the
black teacher Peter H. Clark and Adolph Douai correctly understood that race
discrimination and class exploitation had a mutual correlation. Others saw the
scourge of racial discrimination against blacks but argued that only class
struggle and the achievement of the Socialist Commonwealth could deliver racial
equality. Some others, finally, justified blacks’ discrimination adopting
scientific racialist and social Darwinist approaches that proved, in their
opinion, the biological inferiority of blacks.
It is my contention that the concept of “scales of struggle” is extremely
useful to shed light on the strengths and limits of socialists of the time. On
the one hand, a key shortcoming of the SLP was its failure to organise African
Americans in the South, something that was at least in part caused by the
structural weakness of the party’s Southern sections and their inability to
create connections with black workers’ communities. On the other hand, only
by adopting a transatlantic analytical perspective, which considers the strong
connections between the German and the American socialist movements, it is
possible to understand how American socialist racial thought developed in this
period. In sum, by placing the Gilded Age American socialist movement in a
context that considers its different “scales of struggle”, my paper will
offer a reassessment of the complex relationship between socialism and race in
a key moment for the history of the multiracial American working class.</p> </p>
