<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  “The Question of ‘Self-Determination’”: HUAC Investigates the
Specter of Cross-Border Communism in Texas, 1938-39
The creation of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in spring
1938 coincided with a wave of Communist Party (CP) activism in Texas toward
unifying Mexican Americans and their organizations. This campaign sparked fears
among anticommunists of the northward infiltration of communists from Mexico
over a period of tolerance for the Party there during the leftist presidency of
Lazaro Cardenas. The CP did not create this activism, which was fostered by the
consular offices of Mexico in Texas, but it did actively seek to co-opt it. The
stated goals of the consular project were the uplift and unity of Mexicans
living in Texas to achieve both their well-being there and also aid, and in
some essential skills cases return, to Mexico. Anticommunists feared that the
permeable border would enable circulation of communists, including possibly
thousands of returning Spanish Civil War veterans of the international brigades
offered a home by the Cardenas government. Would an independent state of
Mexican Americans closely allied with Mexico emerge during a revolutionary
crisis? HUAC alarm over this possibility predates the escalation of
anticommunism over fall 1939 to summer 1941 during the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
HUAC investigation into fears of Mexican, not just Russian, communism and the
potential radicalization and unification of the largest minority group of the
Southwest, while African American activism escalated in the Southeast, inserts
the southern border as a key component of our understanding of race and region
in the evolution of anticommunism.</p>

<p>□  "Our sweat and our blood have fallen on this land to make other men
rich”: Narrative, Context and the Articulation of Workers’ Dreams in El
Plan de Delano 
“To those who oppose us, be they ranchers, police, politicians, or
speculators, we say that we are going to continue fighting until we die, or we
win.”</p>

<p>What were the ideological foundations of the Plan of Delano, drafted in 1966 by
Cesar Chavez and Luis Valdez? How did Emiliano Zapata’s agrarian dreams,
defined in 1911 in the Plan of Ayala, serve as a guide in the crafting of El
Plan de Delano? In his commentary to the Plan, Valdez wrote: “It was decided
by all involved that a statement of some kind was in order.” In tailoring
Zapata’s ambitious “oratory” to the needs of Californias “humble”
campesinos, Valdez described the adaptation of a revolutionary document with
the goal of setting social justice ideals and demands down in words.
Essentially serving as a human rights document, the Plan’s character was
defined by a non-violent approach to redress the social suffering of farm
workers in search of a broad coalition of support. Was the document subversive
in its context or necessary for the rebalancing of labour asymmetries defined
by racial oppression?</p>

<p>□  Turn of the Century Technê: Anarchist Newspapers as Social Media in Los
Angeles, Borderlands, and Mexico in the Early Twentieth Century
The vast cultural production of the transnational radical community in Los
Angeles, California and the borderlands is exceeded by the overlapping network
of individual and organizational connections that sustained it. By the early
twentieth century the shrinking of space and time through technological change
facilitated the ability of anarchists to turn a global movement into reality.
Through personal networks, mass meetings, and print media anarchists in Los
Angeles formulated the terms of their struggle, coordinated their actions,
broadcasted their views to a broader tier of supporters and sympathizers, and
attempted to spread their message to the public at large. Anarchist newspapers
printed in Los Angeles, such as Regeneración, maintained a nearly-global
readership as improvements in transportation technologies lowered the cost of
international mail. During this period the leftist press as a whole fostered an
imagined global community of radicals, which served as the base for expressions
of solidarity. At moments of local crisis, usually during a strike or the
imprisonment of participants, organizers sent letters and telegrams
communicating appeals for financial contributions, and supporters responded.</p>

<p>Newspapers functioned as the most public manifestation of a layered radical
community spanning individual association, organizational solidarities, and the
printed page. In this sense, anarchist newspapers in the early twentieth
century functioned as “social media” in a remarkably similar way as digital
social media today. Further, the necessity of using mail delivery service to
the transport newspapers and letters across distance became their biggest
weakness. Most governments around the world—democratic or not—relied on
their control of mail service to refuse delivery of publications deemed
objectionable and to monitor personal communications. Governments controlled
this crucial piece of the dissemination infrastructure. This paper will provide
an examination of a movement that remained predominantly analogue in its
communication technologies, but global in its reach.</p>

<p>□  Silence Sets the Agenda: LULAC's Inactivity during the 1946 Copper Strike
and the CoalescenceThis study explores how the League of United Latin American
Citizens earned a reputation for being an out-of-touch middle-class
organization. Throughout the 1930s, local LULAC councils actively pursued
community campaigns that matched the Mexican American civil rights
organization’s larger agenda, especially against issues related to
educational, social, and economic discrimination. World War II interrupted
LULAC’s civil rights efforts both nationally and locally. After the war, the
organization regrouped under a unified national agenda that made access to
equal education LULAC’s most important priority. Therefore, as the El Paso
copper workers struck for national wage standards, El Paso Local Council No.
132 had other civil rights concerns. Actions by leaders of El Paso’s Mexican
American community indicated that they thought advancing LULAC’s national
policy was more important than addressing immediate local issues. Mexican
American workers, in turn, looked to the CIO and other unions for support.
LULAC’s lack of response to the strike and the Mexican American workers in El
Paso helps explain why many scholars have characterized LULAC as an
out-of-touch middle class organization. Nevertheless, in 1946 LULAC did lead a
successful campaign in the Mendez v. Westminster case against school
segregation in California. Therefore, during the post-war period, LULAC
continued to fight for civil rights through legal action and electoral
politics. But the focus of these efforts had changed—and narrowed. Workers’
rights in local strikes were no longer top priorities. of a National Civil
Rights Agenda</p> </p>
