<h4>U.S. Labor’s Modernizing Mission: Exporting Industrial Pluralism in the “Development Decade”</h4>

<em>Jeff Schuhrke</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This essay considers the relationship between U.S. labor and international
development in the 1960s.  It centers the AFL-CIO’s Cold War foreign
activities on modernization theory and ties to the U.S. Agency for
International Development, instead of on covert ops and ties to the CIA, as
other histories have done. Labor and industrial relations were central
components of America’s overseas modernization project in the 1960s. 
“Industrial pluralism”—the political and legal paradigm that defined U.S.
labor relations from the end of World War II to the 1970s, which emphasized
class collaboration, productivity, and limited state intervention—was one of
the defining features of what industrial relations scholars, labor leaders, and
liberal policymakers in the 1960s considered to be “modern.” They aimed to
export this paradigm to the global South in the name of development and
anti-Communism.</p> </p>
