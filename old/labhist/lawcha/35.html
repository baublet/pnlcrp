<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>1) Obringer: Pennsylvania passed the first child labor law in 1848. Embedded
with this
law
was a 10 hour work day provision. In 1849 the law changed. Surrounding the
passage of these laws was the labor movement's call for a ten-hour day. This
paper will attempt to distinguish whether the factors that convinced the
government to pass these laws was born of the protests of working people, or
pressures from elsewhere.</p>

<p>2) Derickson: The proposed paper addresses a struggle over workers’ right to
know about
health hazards they faced on the job.  In the 1910s, New York set a progressive
policy of providing access to hazard information such as the findings of state
inspections and the reports of occupational disease cases filed by physicians. 
Prior to the 1930s, Connecticut was the only state impounding that sort of
evidence of hazrds.  New York placed regulation of occupational health under
its state labor department; Connecticut gave that authority to its state health
agency.  A clause in the Social Security Act promoted development of
occupational health capability in state health departments by offering funding
to establish new industrial-hygiene units, shifting the scale of public-policy
struggle over this matter to the national-government level.  As states pursued
the federal funds and followed the Public Health Service’s guidance to
emulate Connecticut, the labor movement fought back by defending the
state-level labor agencies.  At the end of the 1930s, liberal Senator James
Murray offered a proposal to allow state labor departments to share in the
Social Security grants.  The battle over his bill brought to light the
injustice of supporting health bureucracies that refused to share
life-and-death information with the workers at risk.</p>

<p>3) Barclay examines how white, disabled working
class men of Western Pennsylvania reformulated or reinscribed masculinity
during the collapse of the steel industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p> </p>
