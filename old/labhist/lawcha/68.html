<h4>Silence Sets the Agenda: LULAC's Inactivity during the 1946 Copper Strike and the Coalescence of a National Civil Rights Agenda</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This study explores how the League of United Latin American Citizens earned a
reputation for being an out-of-touch middle-class organization. Throughout the
1930s, local LULAC councils actively pursued community campaigns that matched
the Mexican American civil rights organization’s larger agenda, especially
against issues related to educational, social, and economic discrimination.
World War II interrupted LULAC’s civil rights efforts both nationally and
locally. After the war, the organization regrouped under a unified national
agenda that made access to equal education LULAC’s most important priority.
Therefore, as the El Paso copper workers struck for national wage standards, El
Paso Local Council No. 132 had other civil rights concerns. Actions by leaders
of El Paso’s Mexican American community indicated that they thought advancing
LULAC’s national policy was more important than addressing immediate local
issues. Mexican American workers, in turn, looked to the CIO and other unions
for support. LULAC’s lack of response to the strike and the Mexican American
workers in El Paso helps explain why many scholars have characterized LULAC as
an out-of-touch middle class organization. Nevertheless, in 1946 LULAC did lead
a successful campaign in the Mendez v. Westminster case against school
segregation in California. Therefore, during the post-war period, LULAC
continued to fight for civil rights through legal action and electoral
politics. But the focus of these efforts had changed—and narrowed. Workers’
rights in local strikes were no longer top priorities.</p> </p>
