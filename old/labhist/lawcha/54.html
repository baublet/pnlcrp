<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel examines the interconnections between labor and racialized space in
a larger context of capitalism and neoliberalism. Living in barrios, labor
camps, or on the margins of the state, communities of color have experienced
and endured the disciplining power of racialized space that often isolates and
marginalizes them. Organizing within these spaces, working class communities
have fought the socioeconomic and legal structures that force them into
livelihoods characterized by low wages and poor living and working conditions.
The social movements that have emerged from place-based struggles have operated
at varying scales and with diverse definitions of community and belonging.
Migrant communities, for instance, have drawn clear links between the
conditions that push them out of their homes and the structures that keep them
impoverished in the United States. Some Mexican Americans have drawn the
boundaries of community around citizenship, making clear how legal status
organizes social space. The papers in this session examine how working class
groups have leveraged their social membership in the communities where they
reside to fight for such things as better housing, higher wages, and
environmental justice. Together they elucidate the changing relationship
between workers and the state, pointing to the varying ways racialized space
defines the terms of this relationship and what communities of color have done
to remake theses spaces.</p> </p>
