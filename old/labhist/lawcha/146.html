<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our panel shows how unions used the levers of state power to advance a variety
of progressive causes in the postwar era. While the dominant narrative of labor
and the state after World War II decries bureaucratization and waning
militancy, our papers reveal generative interactions between unions and
structures of governance at multiple scales, from local political campaigns to
federal antipoverty policies and Supreme Court jurisprudence. This political
activity was facilitated, in part, by major changes to postwar government
organization in the United States, including new civil rights and antipoverty
legislation at the federal level.
Kelly Goodman explores the UAW's role in securing state protection for teacher
organizing and school desegregation through local school board elections in
Detroit. Lindsey Dayton shows how HERE deployed legal resources to help workers
file individual workplace claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nick
Juravich charts the AFT's organizing among community-based workers hired with
funding from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Chair Emily
Lieb will comment on the interplay between state policy and organizing of many
kinds. 
Labor's efforts in the political arena connected unions with ongoing struggles
for black freedom, economic justice, and women's liberation in this era,
creating openings for new forms of social movement unionism. While these
campaigns yielded uneven results, they point to the possibility of using
political action and state structures to build and expand the labor movement.</p> </p>
