<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>An effort begun by LAWCHA’s Teacher/Public Sector Initiative, Teaching
Labor’s Story aims to collect primary sources that capture the struggles and
sentiments of workers in each era of US history to help infuse labor and
working-class history into US history classrooms.  LAWCHA members provide both
excerpts of these primary sources along with guides that provide the necessary
background information—such as historical context, “sourcing” the source,
defining key terms, and even some potential discussion questions—that help
teachers and students utilize these documents.                                This
panel
will
explain
the
development of Teaching Labor’s Story, provide existing source excerpts and
guides, and invite LAWCHA members to provide and solicit additional
contributions.                                Further, the committee distributed
existing
primary
sources and
guides to both practicing and pre-service teachers, asking for feedback on the
current form of Teaching Labor’s Story materials.  The panel will share the
findings of this feedback.  The Teaching Labor’s Story initiative aspires to
make labor and working-class history more accessible to students and teachers,
demonstrating just how central it is to all eras of US history, because, like
race and gender, class is everywhere.</p> </p>
