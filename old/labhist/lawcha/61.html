<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In 2012 the Chicago Teachers Union, led by a new leadership team from the
Caucus of Rank-and-file Educators, initiated a transformative contract campaign
and a nine-day strike that inspired the labor movement.  In 2013-14 they
organized massive community pressure that was ultimately unsuccessful in
stopping the closure of fifty neighborhood schools.  In 2015 their support led
to the insurgent candidacy of Chuy Garcia against Mayor Rahm Emanuel, forcing
the mayor into an unexpected run-off election.                                      </p>

<p>The union continued the work it had begun in 2010 to build a strong
labor-community coalition in defense of public education, but aggressively
broadened that coalition in early 2016. </p>

<p>On April 1 2016 the coalition engaged in a one-day political strike, and a
coalition of several dozen community and labor groups mobilized in a day of
multiple actions on the theme that “Chicago is not broke!”                       </p>

<p>The
mayor
and
Board of Education declared it an illegal strike; the CTU disagreed and took
the action.  The Chair of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board sided
with CPS in declaring the action illegal. </p>

<p>In October 2016, on the brink of a strike, Mayor Emanuel offered what he had
consistently refused – significant funds from his personal slush fund, the
TIF or Transaction Increment Financing fund, and a strike was averted. The
union could not legally strike over classroom issues. Unlike the 2012
situation, where compensation issues were a strike issue but the union was able
to loudly vocalize the classroom issues that were the driving force behind the
strike, albeit not legally strike issues. </p>

<p>With the Board of Education announcing four “furlough” days in January
2017, amounting to a 2% pay cut, there is talk among CTU members about
launching another strike, legal or not. </p>

<p>The panel will discuss lessons of the last seven years of struggle by the CTU
for education and social justice. </p>

<p>The first outcome of the 2012 Chicago teachers’ campaign was affirmation for
those within labor who argued that there was no substitute for educating,
organizing, and mobilizing the members in a democratic union. CTU’s
experience revealed that it is possible for a union leadership with
determination and the right skills to turn a top-down bureaucratic organization
into a bottom-up social movement.</p>

<p>A second outcome of the Chicago teachers’ experience was that it added new
vigor to a very old debate in US labor about the purpose and goals of unions. <br />
The CTU loudly and defiantly rejected a “pure and simple unionism”
approach.  As Karen Lewis put it, “While unions have been busy advocating for
the rights of our members and institutions, we have made a mistake by
forgetting to relate to and advocate for everyone else.”</p>

<p>A third outcome of the Chicago teachers’ experience was that the teachers
embraced the idea of a labor-community coalition. They would not simply seek
public support through advocating for their students; they would actively seek
allies who shared their goals. A creed of bargaining for the common good made
possible a strategy of organizing strong alliances for the common good. In the
months leading to the averted October 2016 strike, 62 community, parent, and
neighborhood groups signed a statement and held a press conference declaring
that if the CTU were forced to strike, they would stand with the teachers and
bring their members to the picket lines. </p>

<p>A fourth outcome of the strike was linked to the previous two, bargaining and
organizing for the common good, but went deeper. The CTU not only argued that
the goals of parents, students, and teachers were identical—that the
students’ learning conditions were the educators’ teaching conditions. They
not only bargained and struck for both themselves and for their students. The
CTU also exposed and denounced institutional racism and poverty as central
roadblocks to moving Chicago’s students toward a great education. </p>

<p>A fifth outcome of the CTU strike is renewed debate within labor about the
question: Where does our power lie?  From the 1870s through the 1940s, the
answer would have been: Labor’s power lies in strikes, rallies, and marches. 
But from the 1950s to the present, the answer for most of organized labor
shifted to:  Experienced leaders who will service the members, and electoral
politics and lobbying.                                      Instead, the CTU’s
emphasis,
from
challenging
school
closings to the contract fight, has always been on mobilizing its members,
parents, and supporters at Board of Education meetings and in the streets,
including, when necessary, in nonviolent civil disobedience. As Lewis said in
2012, “Our best tool is our ability to put people in the street, a mass
movement, organizing.”</p>

<p>And a sixth issue for discussion are the strengths and the limitations of
collective bargaining. When bargaining and strike issues are legislatively
limited, must a union adhere to the law?  Or is its own path forward to engage
in illegal strikes?</p> </p>
