<h4>Interwoven Identities: Gender, Caste and Community in Mill Work in Colonial Madras</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper is about the processes of integration of women into the workforce of
the cotton textile industry in colonial Madras. It examines the social
perspectives and cultural framework that shaped life and work for the woman
worker. Women played an active, though under-appreciated, role in unionization,
lightning strikes and drawing workers into the freedom movement. Women waged
workplace battles to challenge patriarchal attempts to subordinate them and
helped frame legislative interventions and bring subaltern questions to the
nationalist discourse. <br />
Life at the mill, influenced by ideas of equality of gender, common citizenship
and contract but constrained by colonial subservience to authority, produced a
caricatured modernity that strained against its conservative moorings in caste,
community and gender. We trace the construction of notions of gender, community
and class among the cotton mill labourers, and their interconnections. We
examine perceptions of the state and its institutions, the unions and their
practices.</p> </p>
