<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This roundtable focuses on new histories that include gender politics and
activist labor In Mexican American history from the 1940s to 1994. Alejandra
Garza’s research examines the Texas vaquero through the lens of gender, race,
and class, to explain the complexities of working class Mexicans in South
Texas. She brings in works from Andrez Tijerina and Armando Alanzo to highlight
the histories of ranchers and settlers, as well as the changes that occurred in
ranching during the mid to late twentieth century.  Katherine E. Bynum’s work
analyzes the lived experiences of Elvira Portugal, a Mexican American
businesswoman, who established the Dallas Tortilla and Tamale Factory in the
heart of Little Mexico. Elvira’s story provides insight to women’s working
commitments and how their dual duties to work and home helped sustain their
families as well as the community.  Michael D. Aguirre’s examines a pivotal
movement that developed at the end of the Bracero Program in 1964. Through
agriculture, transnational companies, and use of labor laws, Aguirre reveals
the meanings of the borderlands working class, a transnational labor group that
challenged nationalist notions of an American working class. Tiffany J.
Gonzalez’s discussion focuses on the life of Maria Cardenas, the first
Mexican American woman to serve on San Angelo’s city council. She will bring
forth a nuanced discussion of labor and gender politics that improved the
Mexican American community. Cynthia T. Renteria’s talk looks at La Mujer
Obrera, an independent organization located in El Paso, Tex.  The presentation
considers the history of LMO beginning from organizing women in the garment
industry, and the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lastly,
Joel Zapata’s study discusses women’s transnational response to the North
American Free Trade Agreement.</p> </p>
