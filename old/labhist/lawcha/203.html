<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Session:  Labor Rights and Social Welfare in the Postwar Global South
Chair/Comment:  Leon Fink</p>

<p>Panel on the labor history of India and Brazil, respectively, and directly furthering the LABOR/LAWCHA 'global' move. <br />
A Beveridge Plan for India? Social Insurance and the Making of the "Formal Sector“</p>

<h2>The paper explores the global and local contexts of a central piece of labour legislation that was passed in the first year of Indian independence: the Employees' State Insurance Act of 1948. Global trends in social policy had impacted on Indian debates over the appropriateness of a social insurance scheme for workers since the 1920s; the World War had further intensified this debate in many parts of the world; the postwar crisis, the concomitant rise of labour struggles and the emerging economic policy of the postcolonial dispensation then created the conditions for a peculiar form of social insurance available only to a minority of India's workforce, the employees of the so-called 'organized sector'. While thus being firmly located in a global political context, India's employees' insurance should not be understood in terms of a 'diffusion' of Euro-American forms of social regulation. This paper argues instead, that the peculiar form that worker-oriented social policies took in postcolonial India contributed to a hardening of boundaries between what would later be called 'formal' and 'informal' labour and thus to a regime of labour regulation that diverged substantially from those of the North Atlantic region.</h2>

<p>Labor Legislation and Rural Workers’ Rights in Brazil</p>

<h2> This presentation explores how rural workers in Brazil achieved the same rights as urban ones through both the Labor Courts and labor legislation from the 1950s to the 1980s. The Consolidated Labor Laws (CLT) of 1943 systematize the labor legislation that was already extant in the country, giving such laws a new organic structure and strength. The jurisdiction of the laws initially included urban workers, but excluded almost all those working in rural occupations (the vast majority of workers in the country in the 1940s). This was due to pressures from landowners to assure that the CLT did not recognize rural workers as an occupational category with rights to organize unions and have access to social security legislation. At the same time that the urban labor movement grew stronger in the 1950s,  rural workers as well began to use strikes and the tribunals (regular and labor courts) to fight for the application and expansion of existing rights. Therefore, the decade of the 1950s was a time when the “social problem” of rural workers ceased to be a secondary matter, growing into an explosive issue in the early 1960s. The organizational capacity and pressure of those workers in the arenas of law and justice came to the forefront. However, rural workers’ access to labor rights would  increase only during the administration of President João Goulart, when the Statute of the Rural Worker (ETR) came into effect amid a widespread campaign for basic reforms, particularly land reform. In July 1963, the ETR gave rural workers all the existing rights pertaining to urban employees, thus recognizing the demands of labor. This presentation analyses this fight for the enlargement of rural workers’ rights, which had as its parameter the CLT patterns. The paper also aims to explore the landowners’ reaction, mainly during the Military Dictatorship (1964-1985), when employers began hiring huge numbers of casual workers who were not covered by the law, a situation that generated more struggles in order to enlarge the law and the courts’ jurisdiction.</h2>
