<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most of us know the song “Nine to Five,” sung with an edge by Dolly Parton
and the star-studded Hollywood movie NINE TO FIVE.  Yet few realize that these
two icons of popular culture grew out of a social movement that spanned over
twenty-five years, which had a profound impact on work for women and the labor
movement. </p>

<p>In the early 1970s, a group of women office workers in Boston decided that they
had suffered in silence long enough and created 9 to 5 to force changes in
their workplace. Soon chapters were springing up across the country! 9 to 5
addressed sexual harassment, equal pay for equal work, the glass ceiling and
FMLA. </p>

<p>Clericals were the low-wage workers of their era, and the stories and
strategies of these bold, creative women have deep resonance in contemporary
life. The story and legacy of the 9 to 5 movement speaks directly to today's
low wage workers, the Fight for $15 and the growing inequality of today's
America.</p>

<p>Julia Reichert is an Oscar-nominated filmmaker. Her earlier films include
"Union Maids" (1976), "Seeing Red" (1983), "A Lion in the House" (2006), and 
"The Last Truck: Closing of a GM Plant" (2009)</p> </p>
