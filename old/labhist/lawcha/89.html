<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is a multi-media, inter-disciplinary, immersive workshop that theorizes
and visibilizes the rural, working class activist labors of Northwest
anti-fascist organizers, with special attention to intersections of age,
gender, and race. For twenty years, Kate Boyd and Cristien Storm have
researched and organized against white nationalism in the Pacific Northwest.
During this
moment of escalating white nationalist violence, Kate and Cristien have
partnered
with feminist video artist and curator Molly Mac to interview rural activists
who were active in the 1980’s and 1990’s, in order to build an
inter-generational,
non-teleological bridge that transmits the political imaginaries and
sensibilities of the past to those struggling to organize in the present.
Workshop participants will be immersed in a “living archive” video
exhibition that both documents past resistance strategies and also engages in
the trajectory of future efforts. Participants will simultaneously engage with
an interactive training on the depth and breadth of the white nationalist
movement, anti-fascist rural organizing praxis, and get a chance to practice
developing their own anti-racist responses, rooted in cultural organizing.</p> </p>
