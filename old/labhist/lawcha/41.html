<h4>This is NOT a Local Campaign: Protest Movements in the Post-Liberal Era</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The United States’ abandonment of the liberal welfare state model of the
mid-twentieth century has had drastic impacts on the American working classes.
Attempts to turn public property into private profits through austerity,
privatization, and de-regulation not only greatly expanded corporate power,
they also re-shaped nearly every aspect of American life, from policing and
education to the environment and the workplace. But while corporate power has
become increasingly concentrated in the last several decades, corporate
vulnerabilities have been decentralized through global supply chains and
increasingly complicated methods of outsourcing and subcontracting. These
shifts have altered the ways that protest movements can pressure those in
power.</p>

<p>My paper presentation explores these dynamics through two fascinating case
studies in which Americans at the political margins were forced to build
large-scale coalitions to pressure local opponents on national and
international levels. The first was a decade-long campaign to convince the
University of Arizona to select a less ecologically vulnerable location for a
new telescope complex. As the project’s many backers were revealed throughout
the late 1980s and early 1990s, the campaign expanded from a small coalition of
American Indian activists and environmentalists to an international pressure
campaign targeting dozens of college campuses in the US and Canada, the
Smithsonian Institution, and the Vatican. The second case study was a four-year
campaign by Florida farm workers to force Yum! Brands, the largest restaurant
corporation in the world, to change its labor policies. By the time the boycott
concluded, there were active affiliates at 300 American high schools and
colleges, and students at twenty-two schools had successfully ousted Taco Bell
franchises. Through these stories, I outline some of the complexities of the
economic and political shifts of the post-1960s period, as well as how these
changes have impacted the efforts of protest movements.</p> </p>
