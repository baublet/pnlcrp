<h4>Relationship-Based Organizing: AFSCME’s Clerical Unionization Campaigns at the University of Minnesota</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>By the 1970s, clerical workers in higher education increasingly reached out to
the large unions for help in bargaining, as they encountered a lack of job
security, reorganization of work, and difficult bargaining conditions due, in
part, to diminishing state funding for universities, and turned to affiliation
and unionization to strengthen the workers’ power. AFSCME, which represented
more university office workers than any other union nationally, hoped to appeal
to higher education clericals by drawing on their long experience in the public
sector and paying attention to the majority women clerical workers’
gender-specific needs. Through an examination of the University of Minnesota,
Relationship-Based Organizing: AFSCME’s Clerical Unionization Campaigns at
the University of Minnesota shows AFSCME’s tactical change in unionization
campaigns, switching from unsuccessfully focusing on campaign literature in the
1982 campaign to a highly successful person-to-person organizing model in the
1989-1991 campaign. The tactical change drew lessons from the model employed by
the AFSCME’s clerical organizing campaign at Harvard University and the
working women’s movement. The working women’s movement had a tremendous
impact on the labor movement, including style of organizing, what workplaces
could be seen as unionization targets, and what issues should be prioritized in
campaigns and contracts. This research, based on AFSCME archival collections at
the Walter Reuther Library at Wayne State University, the University Archives
at University of Minnesota, and oral histories with union organizers, provides
depth to the largely unknown history of the university workplace, working
women’s movement, and their union entry into the clerical organizing. Both
the local case study and the national context of organizing will be examined.</p> </p>
