<h4>Imagining the Commonweal: Coxey's Army, Cox's March, and Working Class Political Conceptions of the Public Sphere, 1896-1932.</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In 1896 Jacob Coxey, a populist reformer and small town business leader, led a
group of unemployed workers on a march to Washington D.C. Covering hundreds of
miles, and generating large amounts of newspaper coverage, Coxey and the other
marchers used the conception of the "commonweal" as a central theme in their
rhetoric to challenge popular Gilded Age ideas of the political economy. Routed
at the Capitol Building by police, the protest ended with no formal action
taken by Congress or the Cleveland administration to address public concerns of
the economy. Decades later a radical labor priest, James Renshaw Cox, led a
group of unemployed once again from Pennsylvania to D.C. Echoing many of the
ideas of Coxey and the marchers of the 1890s, Cox was part of a growing segment
of American Catholics who used the commonweal as a framework to reimagine how
the public sphere, politics, and the economy should relate. Once again the
marchers were largely ignored by the President, yet the marchers did gain the
support of Hoover's Treasury Secretary, support that would eventually lead to
political scandal and his impeachment. This paper is an examination of how
working class political movements have reimagined the public sphere,
specifically with the conception of the commonweal, and those reimaginings
were, and still are, radical critiques of capitalist political economy. In a
period where social movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter
rely on the taking of public space, making radical critiques of political
economy, and responding to hostile government responses, such a history is
critical for academic and popular understanding.</p> </p>
