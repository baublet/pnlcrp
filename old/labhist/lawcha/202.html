<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>An evening devoted to the dramatic and powerful labor history of the West Coast waterfront, the importance of preserving that history, and the inspiration it can provide us in our present political moment. This three-part program features segments with labor archivists, ILWU activists, and political
scientists putting the history and present into perspective.</p>

<p>Part 1: Labor Archives History Panel - “Under the Hook, in the Hall, on the March, and upon the Shelves: ILWU-Related Collections at Pacific Coast Labor Archives”  --  In this panel, labor archivists will talk about the ILWU’s rich and often colorful history preserved in archives in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii.
 Featuring the directors of three labor archives -- the Labor Archives and Research Center at San Francisco State University, the Labor Archives of Washington at the
University of Washington, Seattle; and the Anne Rand Library at the International Longshore and Warehouse Union in San Francisco -- this panel will discuss the ways in
which unions, universities, scholars, and activists have worked together to preserve and promote the legacy of the left coast maritime labor movement.  The
presentations will highlight collections from this history, which relate directly to today’s struggles for workers’ rights, immigrant rights, social justice, civil
rights, and other causes. Topics will include the Harry Bridges Deportation trials, the deportation and defense of progressive Filipino American cannery union officers
and members, and other episodes in the union’s long history of activism.  </p>

<p>Part 2: ILWU Activists Panel -“How History Informs Current Struggles” --  ILWU officers consider how the militant history and guiding principles of the union relate directly to today’s struggles and how those lessons can help suggest a path
for current and future efforts.</p>

<p>Part 3: Summary -- Speaker: Michael McCann, Harry Bridges Center Director
Professor of Political Science and Harry Bridges Center Director Michael McCann will consider the history of the ILWU and social justice unionism on the Pacific Coast with issues such as immigration, civil rights, and social justice history and current struggles within the current political context. What lessons from the ILWU’s history inform current can and future actions?</p> </p>
