<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The U.S. labor movement demonstrated signs of a renaissance in the 1990s as
rank-and-file voices on the margins and a new cohort of progressive union
leaders began to break with organized labor’s forty year course steadied by
its established leadership. At the AFL-CIO’s first contested election in
1995, a coalition of dissident union leaders rode the tide of reformism that
flowed from the margins of the labor movement and elected a “New Voice”
slate of progressive officials. New President John Sweeney described the
election as “a moment of hope and promise for the future” and later penned
the epilogue to A New Labor Movement for the New Century (1998), a collection
of essays by contemporary labor activists. Meanwhile, on the shop floor several
unions attempted to revitalize the work stoppage as a winning tactic in labor
conflicts, using both prolonged economic strikes and one day publicity walkouts
to win demands. When labor activist Kim Moody authored Workers in a Lean World:
Unions in an International Economy in 1997 and introduced the concept of
“social unionism,” he was documenting a working-class resistance movement
across the globe that was still underway. That same year in an article titled
“UPS Strike Makes New Labor History,” Nelson Lichtenstein predicted the
Teamsters’ victory would put an end to the prevailing American idea that a
strike was “synonymous with labor's defeat and demoralization.” </p>

<p>This panel begins to explore the U.S. labor movement’s revitalization
efforts during the 1990s by featuring the scholarly analysis of workers’
struggles within two economic sectors. Debbie Goldman contrasts two organizing
campaigns of call center employees in the telecommunications industry during
the 1990s, illustrating the National Labor Relations Act’s structural
obstacles and the Communication Workers of America’s (CWA) role in advancing
new “bargain to organize” tactics outside the NLRA framework. Ryan Wisnor
explores the conditions at large retail bookstores, including Borders and
Barnes &amp; Noble, that sparked two dozen union drives across the country between
1996 and 2003. His work focuses primarily on the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union (ILWU) successful effort to unionize Powell’s Books in
Portland, Oregon.</p> </p>
