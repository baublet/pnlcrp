<h4>From Stewardess to Flight Attendant: Popular Culture, Workplace Relations and Women’s Quest for Workplace Dignity in the Canadian Airline Industry .</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper draws on notions of the ‘stewardess’ in popular culture and
interrogates these against other historical sources detailing flight
attendants’ experience of the workplace. Although labor historians recognize
the importance of probing the ideological context in which workers work, we
tend to see popular culture as distorting or mystifying the ‘real’ world of
work. In this paper, we acknowledge that popular culture can play a mystifying
role, but we also argue that images created by popular culture nonetheless have
an important impact on how jobs are perceived and experienced by workers, as
well as how management shapes the workplace. While our example – flight
attendants – may seem particularly rich in terms of popular culture context,
we believe some of our conclusions about gender, race and class emerging from
the paper might be extrapolated to other jobs. 
Our paper examines popular culture sources (advertising, novels, comic books,
young adult fiction and movies) from the 1940s to the early 1980s, detailing
how these created images of ‘the stewardess,’ with particular attention to
gender roles, sexuality and the family. We examine both Canadian and American
primary sources, indicating some of the cultural differences between this
occupation as it evolved in these two countries – and why. We also examine
images changed over time, and the way in which popular culture may have
contained within it themes that later aided the resistance of flight attendants
to their sexualization on the job.  Finally, we contrast these popular sources
to workplace grievances and conflicts over issues relating to sexuality and the
family expressed through union battles, arbitration and media sources.</p> </p>
