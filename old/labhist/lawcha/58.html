<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The complicated and at times contradictory interplay of class, race and
immigration in the 2016 U.S. elections and the accompanying permutation of both
national political parties offers a unique opportunity for historical analysis.
This session will contextualize these issues as they shaped the 2016 campaign,
analyze the factors underlying their emergence and reassess our understanding
of class, race and immigration in recent American history. </p>

<p>Racism and extremism were among the more visible manifestations of the 2016
elections. Kevin Boyle will explore the elements underlying support for Donald
Trump and draw lessons on how his campaign may provide an opportunity to
rethink presumptions of race, politics and public life. Robyn Muncy will
analyze the use of the term “working class” by presidential candidates and
mass media reporting on the presidential contest and will set current uses of
the phrase “working class” in the context of the term in U.S. political
culture since the 1930s. </p>

<p>While U.S. labor’s active role in the 2016 elections represented a
continuation of its long involvement in national politics, Matthew Garcia will
examine the cost and benefits of partisan political action in a labor movement
context through a case study of the United Farmworkers of America (UFW) in the
1976 national elections. Garcia also will explore lessons learned by
Mexican/Latino civil and labor rights groups from the UFW’s emergence as a
national political force. Sarah Coleman furthers the discussion with a focus on
the influence of anti-immigrant sentiment on liberal policy-making through her
examination of the role California’s middle-class white voters played in
pushing the Clinton administration toward an embrace of triangulation in
immigration policy formation.</p>

<p>Comments will be offered by Tula Connell, labor writer and historian, author of
Conservative Counterrevolution: Challenging Liberalism in 1950s Milwaukee.</p> </p>
