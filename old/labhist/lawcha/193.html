<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Guest Workers, the Cold War, and Dreams of Development in Mexico and Spain
Looking back after 30 years of service to Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the distinguished diplomat Jaime Torres Bodet pondered his most
consequential policymaking endeavor: the 1942 negotiation of the bilateral
agreement that permitted millions of young Mexican men to leave their families
and communities each year to harvest American crops. Known as the Bracero
Program, the accord last more than 20 years and became among the most
controversial policies enacted by Mexico’s post-revolutionary government. Its
critics - both in Mexico and the USA - demonized the Bracero Program as an
exploitative labor system that benefitted American growers at the expense of
both Mexican workers and national pride. The program’s proponents defended it
as a model guest worker accord that guaranteed basic rights for farm workers
while also serving to improve US-Mexican relations during the Cold War.
Building upon social science research from the 1920s, its defenders also
portrayed it as a form of foreign aid in that braceros returned home with the
hard-earned savings and newly-acquired skills to achieve the rural development
goals of the Mexican state. Torres Bodet, for his part, admitted that
“renting out the health and vigor of a large contingent of our countryman to
foreign bosses must be seen, under any circumstances, with sorrow.” But he
considered migration “inevitable” and thus defended a Mexican state policy
meant to defend migrants’ working and living conditions while they labored
abroad. Himself the son of Spanish and French immigrants, the one-time
ambassador to France also likened the Bracero Program to the postwar European
guest worker accords instituted during his posting to Paris (1955-58). From
this perspective, the Mexican braceros were no different from the Spanish
peasants who harvested crops or mined coal in postwar France and Belgium. Many
arrived with the assistance of the Spanish Emigration Institute, the Franco-era
agency that promoted emigration to Europe’s industrial core as an official
antidote to rural unemployment and underdevelopment. Like the Mexican
counterparts, the majority returned to a homeland undergoing rapid economic and
social change.</p>

<p>Taking Torres Bodet’s lead, this paper examines the North American Bracero
Program from the comparative perspective offered by the migratory labor
agreements that sent millions of southern European guest workers to labor in
postwar western Europe. Of course, such programs served fundamentally to
deliver temporary labor to agricultural and industrial employers. But they
ostensibly served broader ends, ranging from their role in promoting economic
development in sending regions to their service as political safety valves, an
ostensible antidote to communism. Based upon research in US, Mexican and
Spanish archives, this paper will analyze these guest worker accords in a
global and comparative perspective by analyzing the developmentalist agenda of
the sending states. It then explores both the economic and cultural effects of
emigration and return migration in Cold War-era Spain and Mexico.</p>

<p>□  The Construction of the Social Collectives and Social Roles: The Silent
Majority in China’s Urbanization
There is a large scale but often neglected marginal population in Chinese
cities. They are scattered in large and small cities and are connected every
day by common daily life. Few notice them or feel their existence, but when the
Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn festival come, and with them vacations,
urban areas notice that life is more inconvenient without them. Nearly every
single building and road in China has been built by them. They are supposedly
the most respected group in the country. However, in reality, they lack basic
social security, they suffer from the limitation of the household registration
system (Hukou), and they are worried about their children's educational
prospects. There is a special derogatory term for them-- "peasant workers."
This group comes from major historical developments as in the early years of
China’s opening-up and reform, the main body of this group were young farmers
who went to the city to seek jobs so as to earn a living. Often as "floating
population", or "external population," these workers exist on the margins of
prosperity, incapable because of legal, cultural, and social biases to become
fully integrated into their new urban setting, but differentiated from the
rural workers who have always remained in the countryside. According to
statistical data from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission,
China's floating population was 253 million in total in 2015. This vast group
accounts for approximately 20% of China's population, often appearing as hot
topics for mass media, newspapers, and academic research. Typically, their
plight is associated with polemics denouncing the Hukou system of China, a
legal system that designates people as rural or urban dwellers, and which is
often associated with the social problems of people being unable to settle,
access social welfare, and gain education. This presentation is an exploration
of these workers, the Hukou system, and how popular polemic works have done
little to understand the underlying problems of China’s migrant population.
Examining the history of the Hukou system, this paper explores the deeper
issues at play in popular biases toward these rural workers, and concludes that
in order to gain a deeper understanding of workers around the world we first
must understand the complex, and ever changing nature of urban planning, slum
developments, and the more important cultural biases that contribute to
marginalization. There is no denying that until today the fate of these
migrants and their city dreams has been uncertain. Therefore, in keeping with
this conference’s theme of global analysis, this article aims to utilize
their case so as to analyze the impact of the construction of social
collectives and roles on different social groups from an interdisciplinary
perspective. This is done in hope to regain the attention of both academics and
common readers to the issues vulnerable and specific workers face in places
like China and around the world.</p>

<p>□  Forging an Immigrant Workers’ Movement in the Shadows of Border
Militarization, State Anti-Unionism, and the Neoliberal Non-Profit Industrial
Complex <br />
The U.S.-Mexico border along the 100-mile stretch of South Texas land known as
the Rio Grande Valley carries with it some of the most unique and perilous
conditions for laborers in the country. What this region has historically
struggled with in regards to labor rights is a confluence of factors ranging
from geographic isolation to high immigrant populations to Texas’
longstanding anti-union history among others. More recently, however, the level
of militarization in this border region has escalated to the highest point
since the early 20th century efforts against Mexican sediciosos, anti-American,
Mexican dissidents, in which the National Guard was introduced into the region
in order to maintain social control. In 2014, the National Guard was again
summoned, but far from the days of the sediciosos, these armed military members
were mostly patrolling a group of people working and living in perhaps the
worst conditions in America without the crimes rates to justify this extra
oversight. To make matters worse, those who are currently fighting against the
labor injustices of yesterday situated in the border military zone of today,
are also having to deal with the convoluted world of what many have termed
“the non-profit industrial complex.” The border militarization handicaps
potential worker organizing efforts as many fear retribution via deportation
against themselves or family members if they speak up and the non-profit
industrial complex makes it difficult for grassroots efforts to succeed as the
more heavily funded efforts always seem to be those that least challenge the
status quo and in essence least push the envelope for worker rights. Yet in
spite of all this and in spite of the popular anti-union sentiment that has
long plagued the state of Texas, a budding workers center has emerged in South
Texas known as Fuerza Del Valle Workers Center which, using other worker center
models, is creating possibilities for worker liberation in this politically
arid terrain.</p>

<p>Fuerza del Valle is a grassroots workers center which provides support to
workers in the area in cases of wage theft through grassroots methods of
protest and public shaming while utilizing its attachment to the lawyers of the
South Texas Civil Rights Project to leverage power against those who underpay
and/or grossly mistreat South Texas workers in the form of litigation. Fuerza
is small in that it employs only two staff members, but is huge in that it has
an active membership upwards of thirty to forty workers who have either won
claims against former employers through Fuerza or simply choose to proactively
support a worker-based organization knowing that their time of need could come
at any moment in this context of precarious employment on the border. Included
in this group of workers is a sub-committee of female domestic workers who
attempt to find solutions collaboratively to the problems that they face in
their jobs which are notorious for mistreatment and abuse. As well, Fuerza
regularly organizes marches, information sessions and other events in support
of immigrant rights considering that the vast majority of workers involved with
Fuerza are immigrants. The point of this presentation is to detail how
grassroots labor organizing in a place like the South Texas border is taking
place in order to provide insight into the present and future of this work in
immigrant, anti-union, and/or militarized, border communities in the age of
neoliberalism. It is through dialogue with one another while being situated in
different contexts that we believe we can build the best opportunities for the
advancement of worker rights and organizing efforts in spite of the complex
manner in which labor efforts are daily attacked.</p> </p>
