<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel posits farmworkers in the United States, both foreign and domestic,
face similar challenges yet employ different forms of resistance in response to
the constrained choices available to them at the time of a particular labor
conflict. In this panel, Erin L. Conlin explores how Bahamian guestworkers
responded to employment opportunities and subsequent conditions in the United
States, from the 1940s through the 1960s, and how those experiences helped
shape their emerging labor consciousness at home and abroad. Andrew J. Hazelton
examines how the National Farm Labor Union in the United States attempted to
extend labor law coverage to farmworkers in the 1950s, even though they were
denied boycott protection under the Taft-Hartley Act.</p>

<p>Paper 1:
In 1942 the Bracero program, a bi-nationally created temporary labor program
sent over 4.2 million Mexican migrants to the United States. The parameters of
program participation demanded that migrants would be temporary, male, young,
and able bodied. This was a challenge to the decades long tradition of family
migration in which migrants of all ages and both genders often migrated in
family groups to take on enduring and repeating migrations together.  Yet, the
human nature of migration would not be so easily re-ordered. In fact, when ever
possible, women and families would counter this re-ordering and would undertake
their own migrations to the United States.  This paper will explore how the
actions of family members and women constituted a form of resistance to an
imposed and engineered labor system that explicitly undermined a pattern of
human migration that had always been social and familial at its core. </p>

<p>Paper 2:
In June 1942 Bahamian workers in Nassau shattered windows along Bay Street, the
economic and political capital of the island nation, protesting the Jim
Crow-wage system utilized by the United States as it built air and naval bases
on New Providence. A year later, foreign agricultural guestworkers in Florida
rioted, with some news outlets reporting workers were celebrating the
anniversary of the Burma Road Riot. Taken together, these events mark a key
moment of labor consciousness in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>This paper examines Bahamian guestworkers' bitter sweet experiences in the
temporary foreign labor program (“The Contract”), which the Bahamas and
United States engaged in from 1943 to 1966. It explores how participants saw
The Contract as an opportunity to secure better wages and see the world, yet 
were often severely disappointed when confronted with American racism and
deplorable living and/or working conditions. It explains how as workers'
developed a more profound labor consciousness they invented new forms of
struggle to air their grievances and seek remediation.</p>

<p>Paper 3:
In the 1960s and 1970s, the United Farm Workers used consumer and secondary
boycotts to protest agricultural employers’ unfair labor practices and
strikebreaking tactics in California. However, the Farmworker Movement could
pursue some of these boycott tactics only because farmworkers were excluded
from the nation’s labor laws, which restricted boycott activities after the
passage of the Taft-Hartley Act.</p>

<p>This paper examines a critical moment in the legal status of farmworker unions
by focusing on the early 1950s. During the DiGiorgio Strike, the National Farm
Labor Union was enjoined from boycott activities under Taft-Hartley despite the
fact that the workers it represented were not covered by that act. Arguing that
the law was being used to penalize farmworkers while simultaneously withholding
benefits like collective bargaining, the right to strike, and National Labor
Relations Board procedures, the National Farm Labor Union waged an unsuccessful
battle to extended labor law coverage to farmworkers.</p> </p>
