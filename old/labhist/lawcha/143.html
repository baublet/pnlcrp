<h4>Representing Teachers: Labor and Liberalism in Bel Kaufman’s Up the Down Staircase</h4>

<em>Daniel Gilbert</em><br>
University of Illinois

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper situates the explosion of teachers' labor militancy within a broader
cultural conversation about public educators’ role in building the so-called
Great Society. The paper centers on the work of Bel Kaufman, who drew on her
experience as a New York City teacher in her 1965 novel Up the Down Staircase,
which formed the basis for the 1967 Hollywood film of the same name. Kaufman
became a prominent ally of teachers unions around the country from the
mid-1960s forward, and her book articulated experiences and perspectives that
resonated with millions of other teachers. The paper draws on new archival
research in Kaufman’s papers, exploring the ways in which her novel became a
touchstone for broader public reckoning with the workplace politics of public
education.</p> </p>
