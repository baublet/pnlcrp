<h4>Bridging the Class Divide?: How Class Dynamics Shape Labor-Environmental Coalitions in Rural Areas</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In recent years activism around climate change, energy development, and green
jobs has caught the attention of scholars and media outlets.  Labor,
environmental, and community organizations have endorsed large-scale
demonstrations in urban areas, and have mobilized their members to attend.  In
the past few months, protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline suggest that
labor, environmental, and community organizations are collaborating on
environmental issues in rural areas as well.  This paper explores the role of
class in these rural coalitions, asking whether and how the class dynamics in
rural coalitions are distinct from their urban counterparts. </p>

<p>The scholarly literature on labor-environmental coalitions has demonstrated
that divergent interests and discordant organizational cultures make it
challenging for labor and environmental organizations to work together.  While
labor unions’ interests are generally economic, environmental groups focus
almost exclusively on the natural environment.                    Although labor
unions are
organized hierarchically, most involve their members in their day-to-day
operations, inviting them to weigh in on major decisions and policy changes. 
This stands in stark contrast to environmental groups, which tend to be
non-hierarchical but provide limited opportunities for members to influence
day-to-day operations and influence important decisions (Andrews 2005; Longo
and Baker 2014; Minchin 2002; Orbach 2004; Payne 2013).  There is limited but
convincing evidence that the class composition of labor and environmental
organizations contributes to these dissimilar organizational cultures.</p>

<p>This paper draws upon three case studies in order to understand the role of
class in rural labor-environmental coalitions.                    I conducted
in-depth
interviews
with 21 activists involved in three labor-environmental coalitions: one
addressing development and tourism in Montana, one tackling oil drilling in
North Dakota, and one confronting pipeline construction in Nebraska. </p>

<p>My preliminary analysis suggests that class plays a different role in rural
coalitions than it does in urban and suburban areas.  Despite the divergent
class backgrounds of their leaders and members, the labor and environmental
organizations involved in the rural coalitions described above, had a great
deal in common.  Their organizational cultures diverged far less than the
scholarly literature would suggest.  Rural labor organizations in the three
states had less combative, hierarchical cultures, and rural environmental
organizations in the three states provided more avenues for robust member
involvement, than scholars have predicted.  Even more telling, members and
leaders of the two types of organizations tended to share hobbies and
recreational activities in rural areas.  The time that they spent hunting,
fishing and hiking in public lands shaped their organizations’ commitments to
preserving the rural character and natural beauty of their local communities. 
As the analysis proceeds, I expect to find additional evidence of the
centrality of class to these rural coalitions. </p>

<p>While the Green Jobs initiatives of the mid-2000s and labor’s robust
participation in the 2014 People’s Climate March suggest the tremendous
potential of labor-environmental coalitions, the fevered pitch of fracking and
pipeline debates indicate their fragility.  In order to understand the
potential and limits of collaboration between labor and environmental groups in
rural areas, we must understand whether and how class shapes their internal
dynamics.</p> </p>
