<h4>The Ambiguities of Catholic Inter-racialism in 1950s Chicago: Friendship House and the Catholic Interracial Council</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper examines the activities of the Catholic Interracial Council in
Chicago as well its affiliated Friendship House from the mid-1940s through the
1950s under the liberal Bishop Bernard J. Sheil. Indeed, Sheil preached about
the "doom" of racism in 1943 in light of the atrocities committed in Nazi
Germany. This paper considers the relationship of these progressive Catholic
institutions to the political dynamics of the Catholic archdiocese of Chicago
and the U.S. Catholic church generally during the early years of the Cold War
as well as the important missions the church had with working class migrant
communities in the Windy City, particularly Polish and African American
communities. It considers especially how issues of racial discrimination were
discussed in the context of growing early Cold War acrimonies between the
radical left and Catholic workers movements which often leaned towards
conservative ends of the political spectrum and the complexities of ethnic and
racial identities that came to light as a result of these dynamics.</p> </p>
