<h4>Love of Labor Lost? Religion, Human Rights, and the Argentine “Dirty War”</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Argentine “Dirty War,” which followed the 1976 anti-Peron coup and the
international human rights movement it sparked are well-studied topics. This
paper, touching on the conference subtheme of War and Empire will spotlight the
activist role of religious leaders such as Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer, who was
well known for his role in promoting domestic and international social justice
and for bringing the widespread human rights abuses in Argentina to public
attention.  Meyer's role in raising awareness of the human rights abuses of the
Argentine junta is laudable in terms of bringing social justice concerns into
the Jewish and general religious mainstream. However, it is also important to
look at Meyer's role (and that of similar religious leaders) in downplaying the
labor aspects of the Argentine human rights tragedy, the better to deflect
negative associations of human rights with political leftism in the waning Cold
War, and to broaden the base of support. These efforts, in turn, may have
played into the hands of the Videla regime, which pointedly used terror to
silence the workers' movements that formed an important component of the
opposition. Meyer and his like-minded clerical colleagues therefore may also
have contributed to the marginalization of labor and class issues from the
progressive religious activism they helped to create, and with it, the popular
conception of human rights.</p> </p>
