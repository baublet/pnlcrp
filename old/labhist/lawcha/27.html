<h4>Illegal People, Legal Goods: Workers, the Auto Industry and Commuting at the Local Scale in the 1920s Detroit-Windsor Borderland</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Illegal People, Legal Goods” examines America’s northern border to
explore how workers and employers in two nations negotiated new border laws to
shape immigration and trade patterns in America’s industrial core during the
1920s. The paper will trace the shift from open border to regulation in
Detroit, Michigan, a city that represented America’s third industrial center,
fourth city in population, and a key borderland with Canada. Before the U.S.
passed immigration laws in 1921 and 1924, twenty thousand commuters crossed
daily from Windsor, Canada to the factories of Detroit, while major automobile
companies ferried parts across the same river for assembly in Windsor branches.
To the horror of American employers and Canadian business interests, new
American immigration laws threatened to regulate the international border in
new ways. Over the next several years, unions, employers, and politicians on
both sides of the border waged a battle over the commuting issue that raised
concerns over the endurance of free trade, the threat of dangerous foreigners,
and friendly relations between two North American nations.</p>

<p>This paper takes up the fraught issue of Canadian commuting to reveal how
unions, employers, and two governments negotiated border crossing as an
Anglo-Saxon privilege, making the border between “desirable” Anglo-Saxon
North Americans and “undesirable” ethnic Europeans more important than the
international boundary. After 1924, the Detroit Federation of Labor (DFL)
capitalized on a growing anxiety over foreignness and border crossing to launch
a campaign against the twenty thousand Canadian commuters who crossed into
Detroit daily for work. Union efforts not only angered American employers and
Canadian business interests, but they outraged Canada’s Foreign Office. Eager
to avoid a clash with its northern neighbor or major automobile corporations,
in 1927, the U.S. Department of Labor negotiated an agreement with Canada that
allowed Anglo Canadians and British nationals to keep commuter cards, yet
restricted commuters of foreign origin regardless of their Canadian
citizenship. U.S.-Canadian negotiations also allowed major employers to
maintain and even grow Windsor branch plants, factories with notoriously low
pay and poor conditions. The result, which mollified the DFL and the Canadian
state, set a precedent for excluding individuals on the basis of ethnicity in
the borderland region, while ensuring that the border would remain open to the
trade of goods.</p> </p>
