<h4>Police Power as Political Power: The New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the 1966 Civilian Review Board Referendum</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>When in 1966, the new mayor of New York City, John Lindsay, introduced private
citizens into the process to take and investigate complaints against the
police, the local police union and its allies waged a successful campaign to
remove them via referendum and amend the city’s charter to prohibit civilians
from serving on any police review board. In analyzing the review board
referendum, a new form of police power becomes apparent – political. While
there are many volumes on police brutality, scholars have not recognized the
more subtle forms of domination police are able to exercise. Books critical of
the NYPD focus on violence and methods of coercion, as well as falsified
charges, lying and social repression.  These allegations are well documented,
but they do not encompass all of the power the police department has deployed.
In its effort to destroy the new review board in 1966, the police union, the
Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, vowed to spend its $1.5 million treasury
on advertising. Working closely with a veteran Madison Avenue advertising
executive and an external firm, the PBA was able to bring out white voters to
defeat a liberal measure, the first time a progressive matter had lost at the
polls in the city in decades. Running a racially coded campaign designed to
incite fear of crime in white voters, the PBA, with no prior experience in
politicking, was more successful than it had anticipated. In less than six
months, the twenty thousand strong PBA was able to muster 1.3 million voters to
ban civilian oversight of police and repudiate one of Mayor Lindsay’s core
programs. Police power in New York extends beyond how we commonly think of it.</p> </p>
