<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  “Badly Need[ed]…Capital”: Organized Labor, Trade Policy, and Visions
of Globalization at the end of Bretton Woods
Amid the historic fracturing of the American political system during Nixon's
second term, it was business leaders and administration officials who embarked
on an ambitious journey to open investment and trade markets abroad, including
in the Communist countries. The Trade Act of 1974 was instrumental in this
strategy. The attachment of American union leaders to an anti-Communist foreign
policy kept them looking backwards, opposed to international collective
bargaining in Europe, bereft of solutions to the problems of global economic
integration. Their inability to bargain over employer investment decisions and
the historic weakness of American full-employment policies left protectionism
as one of the only tools to maintain domestic employment. For these reasons
labor found itself opposed to détente, confronting an administration
portraying investment regulations—capital controls—as not only illiberal
diplomacy, but as restraints on domestic economic growth and full employment.In
the minds of C. Fred Bergsten, Pete Peterson, and other cabinet officials
including George Shultz, Herbert Stein, and William Simon, capital mobility,
the destabilizing force of the Bretton Woods system, would become the new basis
of world economic integration. The remarkable success of their program would
have a lasting impact on the tone and inflection of American liberalism in the
late twentieth century.</p>

<p>□  U.S. Labor’s Modernizing Mission: Exporting Industrial Pluralism in the
“Development Decade”
This essay considers the relationship between U.S. labor and international
development in the 1960s. It centers the AFL-CIO’s Cold War foreign
activities on modernization theory and ties to the U.S. Agency for
International Development, instead of on covert ops and ties to the CIA, as
other histories have done. Labor and industrial relations were central
components of America’s overseas modernization project in the 1960s.
“Industrial pluralism”—the political and legal paradigm that defined U.S.
labor relations from the end of World War II to the 1970s, which emphasized
class collaboration, productivity, and limited state intervention—was one of
the defining features of what industrial relations scholars, labor leaders, and
liberal policymakers in the 1960s considered to be “modern.” They aimed to
export this paradigm to the global South in the name of development and
anti-Communism.</p>

<p>□  From Laborlore to the Labor Bureaucracy and an Ideology of Pragmatism
The folklorist Archie Green has argued that studying laborlore--a broad range
of culturally expressive practices in trade unions, work traditions, practices,
could help create a more inclusive pedagogy and history, built from the bottom
up, rooted in class and class conflict in the service of a broad democratic
politics. One way laborlore can do this is to investigate the culture practices
of labor officials. This presentation will explore songs, stories, and jokes to
help understand how laborlore can prop up a union bureaucracy as well support
as democratic politics.</p>

<p>□  Undocumented Capital: U.S. [Im]mobilization, Containment, and Exploitation of Migrant Labor: shows how U.S. policies of citizenship, immigrant policing,
and detention and deportation rely on the spatial logistics of containment to
render invisible undocumented persons while shoring up the global neoliberal
capital project that relies on a tractable, disposable labor force.</p> </p>
