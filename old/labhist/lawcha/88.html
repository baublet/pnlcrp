<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>For the past two decades, the best histories of migrant laborers have adopted a
transnational approach, using sources and interpretations from workers’
places of origin as well as their work sites. Now, some scholars are trying to
expand their frames even further. They hope to consider the phenomenon of
migrant labor on a global scale. This work is methodologically dicey,
presenting challenges of research, interpretation, and narration. </p>

<p>In this panel, scholars at three different stages of their academic careers
demonstrate possible ways to further our understanding of migrant labor as a
phenomenon that has been not only national or binational, but global. Recent
Ph.D. María Quintana examines the discourses of the Mexican national and
British colonial governments in the 1940s-60s, finding insightful parallels in
the ways in each justified its decision to cooperate with U.S. labor
recruitment attempts. Just-tenured historian Julie Weise examines primary
sources on Mexican braceros and their Spanish contemporaries working in France
to unearth connections between the ideas each brought into their official and
unofficial labor actions. And senior scholar Cindy Hahamovitch examines the
relationship between British abolitionism and the rise of indentured (or
“coolie”) labor systems, illuminating more continuity than change between
slavery and its successor.</p>

<p>In all, these three papers foreground the importance of ideas by and about
labor migration to situate such migrations as central phenomena in modern world
history.</p> </p>
