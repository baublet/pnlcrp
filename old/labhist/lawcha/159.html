<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since the 1970s, public sector unions have occupied a position of relative
strength within a shrinking organized labor movement in the United States. In
recent years, attacks on public sector unions by conservative governors and
corporate lobbying organizations in Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan (to
name only a few examples) have raised the question: can public sector unions
retain their position as a stronghold of union density and political influence?
How have public sector unions responded to similar political challenges in the
past? More broadly, what is the relationship between public sector unions and
conservative politics in the United States? While public sector unions have
challenged the neoliberal contraction of public services and social programs,
some have also abetted the expansion of the carceral state, and conservative
“law and order” politics. The relationship between public sector unions and
conservative politics is thus a complex and, at times, paradoxical one.
This panel examines the complex relationship between public sector unions and
conservative politics in three different areas. Joseph Hower’s paper shows
how AFSCME, under the leadership of Jerry Wurf, responded to anti-tax populism
(and related attacks on public sector workers) in the 1970s. Elizabeth Faue’s
paper turns to the issue of school violence during the same period, considering
how the AFT under Albert Shanker advocated “zero tolerance” juvenile
justice policies in response to rising rates of assault against teachers. The
paper considers the relationship between teachers’ unions and the “school
to prison pipeline.” Finally, Josiah Rector’s paper focuses on how
conservative politicians and lobbying groups in Michigan have used Emergency
Manager laws to undermine public sector unions in the 21st century. The paper
considers the effectiveness of union responses to Emergency Manager laws,
including strikes, lawsuits, ballot referenda, and other strategies.</p>

<p>Joseph E. Hower, “Every Candidate . . . Is Running Against Our Union”:
AFSCME’s Response to Tax Cut Fever in the Late 1970s”</p>

<pre><code>    Dropping earlier legalistic objections to unionization, the Public
</code></pre>

<p>Service Research Council and other similar groups seized on the growing
salience of tax issues during the late 1970s to craft a critique of union power
that stressed the threat posed to the citizen-taxpayer. At the same time,
anti-tax activists like Howard Jarvis found in the anti-public worker language
a compelling tool to wield in their own campaigns, one which effectively masked
the fiscal implications of their tax-cutting logic. By casting government
workers as parasites on the body politic, Jarvis and others were able to
suggest that revenues could be reduced without cutting services, simply by
shrinking the share directed to government workers through pay cuts, benefit
reductions, and layoffs. Proposition 13, then, was not solely a California
issue, nor was it even strictly about the distribution of the costs of
suburbanization.  It was also the manifestation of an older anti-public worker
impulse fused with an increasingly urgent concern over taxes, a potent
combination that posed little less than an existential crisis for the public
sector labor movement. 
        My paper will explore the response of one union, the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, to the emergence of
anti-tax politics in the late 1970s. Although it had pressed for state and
local tax reform for the better part of a decade, the union initially
underestimated the political power of the fused anti-tax / anti-worker /
anti-union argument. President Jerry Wurf and other union officials assumed
that middle-class taxpayers would never risk valued public services by sharply
curtailing public revenues, so their initial response to rising anxieties over
taxes focused on a multi-million dollar advertising campaign designed to
establish AFSCME as "The Union that Works For You." Predicated on defending
public sector unions by defending public services, the strategy was designed to
instill in taxpayers of the inextricable link between the tax bill and basic
government services. Forced into an even more defensive posture in the
aftermath of Proposition 13, AFSCME adopted a two-track response to the crisis,
trading short-term concessions to stunt the growth of the backlash while also
pushing progressive alternatives to the "meat axe" approach in states like
Michigan and Oregon. Partly successful at mitigating the worst effects of the
Tax Revolt, the union’s campaign nonetheless rested on a misreading of the
new political landscape. AFSCME in general, and Wurf in particular,
misunderstood the extent to which the politicization of public workers (and
their unions) had altered the basic taxes-services equation. Far from
undercutting the core message of conservative critics, AFSCME's defense of
government services only served to strengthen the perception that those
services were, at least in part, self-serving. </p>

<p>Elizabeth Faue, “Teachers and the School to Prison Pipeline: The AFT, “Zero
Tolerance Policies,” and School Violence, 1970-2000”
        During the 1970s, a series of government studies and media reports
sounded the alarm about rising rates of violence, drug use, theft, and
vandalism in the nation’s public schools. For teachers, such violence led to
deteriorating work environments that put teachers, school workers, and students
at risk. Historians of the carceral state have analyzed the “law and order”
politics of this period and the increased investment of the state in the
criminal justice system, but in general they have paid little attention to
schools. The politics of school violence played a critical role in the
expansion of the juvenile justice system, which activists have called the
“school-to-prison pipeline.”  In less obvious ways, public investment in
the criminal justice system—increasing government expenditures—competed
with education in government budget battles. 
        This paper shows how AFT officials, particularly AFT President Albert
Shanker, responded to rising rates of assault against AFT members by students
by promoting “zero tolerance” policies against juvenile offenders. It
argues that, while these policies developed in response to school violence,
“zero tolerance” contributed to the problem of mass incarceration, by
substituting heavy-handed policing and surveillance for therapeutic approaches
and structural solutions to school segregation and underfunding. In the 1990s
and 2000s, activists from other teachers’ unions (and even within the AFT)
advocated policies that sought to protect teachers and students from violence
but avoided the criminalization of youth. By examining how the AFT under
Shanker responded to the crisis of school violence in the 1970s and 1980s, this
paper provides a fresh perspective on the origins of the “school to prison
pipeline.”</p>

<p>Josiah Rector, “Deposing the ‘Modern-Day Cincinnatus’?: Public Sector
Union Responses to Emergency Manager Laws in Michigan, 2000-2015”
In Michigan in recent decades, Emergency Manager laws have radically expanded
the power of the state government to take over municipalities and school
districts in fiscal crisis. Most critiques of Emergency Manager laws focus on
their troubling implications for voting rights and racial equity. In 2013, for
example, over half of African American voters in the state of Michigan lived in
municipalities run by unelected Emergency Managers, rendering citizens’ votes
for mayors and city council members void. Commentators have paid relatively
little attention to the impact of Emergency Manager laws on Michigan’s public
sector unions. However, this paper argues that efforts by conservative
politicians and wealthy donors to undermine public sector unions are central to
the design and implementation of Emergency Manager laws. Right-wing
intellectuals, like Michael Van Der Beek of the Mackinac Center for Public
Policy, celebrate the Emergency Manager as a “modern-day Cincinnatus” with
dictatorial powers to cast aside “self-serving union bosses” and dissolve
“inept local school boards.” These laws enable gubernatorial appointees to
void public sector union contracts; eliminate local school boards; privatize
schools and other public assets; replace unionized public workers with private
contractors; and suspend collective bargaining for up to five years. By
weakening Michigan’s public sector unions, moreover, supporters of these laws
hope to set an example for other states.
This paper examines how public sector unions in Michigan have responded to
Emergency Manager laws in Michigan during the past fifteen years. Union locals
in Detroit and other cities have used lawsuits, electoral campaigns, and
strikes to battle specific Emergency Manager initiatives, such as outsourcing,
pension cuts, and layoffs. In 2012, unions played a central role in a statewide
ballot measure to repeal Public Act 4, which a majority of Michigan voters
approved. However, the replacement of the law with the referendum-proof Public
Act 436 posed an unprecedented challenge to public sector unions, raising
questions about the viability of their current political strategies. This paper
argues that, while local contractual fights are necessary, unions should
develop broader coalitions with other groups disadvantaged by Emergency Manager
laws.</p> </p>
