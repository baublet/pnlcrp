<h4>Class in Session: Teaching Labor History Through Digital Tools</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Students learn best when we invite them to be scholars and researchers.  My
presentation explores some of the techniques and sources I have been using to
“flip the classroom” in labor studies courses at UW, Tacoma.  These
sessions of class utilize digital resources and open-source archives to engage
students in various topics in the study of work and labor history.  I want to
highlight two projects in particular.  The first utilizes Social Explorer, the
online prescription database tool, which my students have utilized to create an
economic report card of their region for the past three years.        The second
project invites students to create and revise topics in Wikipedia.  To date,
the majority of entries concerning labor strikes during the Great Depression
were created by my students at UW and UW, Tacoma.  These kinds of assignments
help students transcend the boundaries of the campus and lends gravity to the
otherwise abstract concepts we teach in the classroom.</p> </p>
