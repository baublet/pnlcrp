<h4>Mirroring the Empire: Cigar Makers' International Union and Anti-Cuban Sentiment, 1898-1901</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper looks at anti-Cuban sentiment within the Cigar Makers’
International Union (CMIU) during and immediately after the Spanish-American
War. Dating back to 1868, Cubans formed émigré enclaves in various parts of
the United States with Key West and Ybor City (in present-day Tampa) in
Southern Florida serving as two of the larger hubs. Both communities were
centered around the Cuban cigar industry and developed labor unions with deep
ties to the Cuban independence movement and Spanish anarchism. The CMIU made
several attempts to organize Cuban workers in Southern Florida but were
repeatedly rebuffed. This paper argues that the CMIU adopted the language of
American colonialism in order to justify replacing the Cuban-led unions of
Southern Florida. Following the Spanish-American War, the United States
military and government characterized Cubans as unfit for self-rule and
democracy. These characterizations were used to justify the occupation of Cuba
and subsequent interventions made possible by the 1901 Platt Amendment. The
CMIU adopted many of these same characterizations to demean Cuban-led unions
and argued that Anglo leadership was needed in order to properly lead Southern
Florida’s cigar unions. By 1901, the CMIU was able to situate itself as the
alternative to the radical labor unions of Southern Florida and became the
dominant representative of cigar workers as more radical unions were quelled by
vigilantism.</p> </p>
