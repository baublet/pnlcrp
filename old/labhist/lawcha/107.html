<h4>Civil Liberties and Anticolonialism in a Time of War: The National Labor Defense Council, 1917-18</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Founded by labor lawyer Frank P. Walsh shortly after the US entry into World
War I, the National Labor Defense Council (NLDC) has been all but forgotten.
Avoided by most pro-war progressives and ridiculed by AFL president Samuel
Gompers, the poorly-funded NLDC proved even less effective in defending antiwar
activists than Roger Baldwin’s National Civil Liberties Bureau (forerunner of
the ACLU). Nonetheless, as my paper will show, the links that the NLDC <br />
forged
between antiwar labor radicals and anticolonial activists (especially those
working within America’s small South Asian population)—along with Walsh’s
own experiences defending such activists—paved the way for a vibrant post-war
anticolonial coalition, exemplified by the founding of the broadly-based League
of Oppressed Peoples in 1919 and the emergence of the Farmer-Labor political
upsurge of 1920.  </p>

<p>Drawing heavily on the voluminous Frank P. Walsh collection in the New York
Public Library, my paper provides an elaboration of themes that I discuss in my
forthcoming essay, “The Easter Rising and New York’s Anticolonial
Nationalists,” in Ireland’s Allies: America and the 1916 Easter Rising, ed.
