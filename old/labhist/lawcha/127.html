<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The growth in the numbers of part-time faculty is one expression of the
increasing corporatization of universities.  Currently, a majority of college
teachers in the county is temporarily employed, often with no more than 15
weeks of job security, and working for low pay, with no health or retirement
benefits.  Along with this casualization of labor, however, are attacks on
faculty governance and a devaluation of a liberal arts education.  Rising
numbers of contingent faculty have undermined the status of all faculty and
allowed universities to more easily adopt corporate agendas and priorities. 
Departments and faculty who have opposed the neo-liberalization of the
university have often been targeted for removal.  The problems faced by
temporary instructors cannot be addressed separately from the broader
transformation of higher education.  WalMart University is here.
        We propose a roundtable discussion, organized around a series of very
short presentations and generative questions to explore the historical,
political, and institutional forces driving this move toward a
“faculty-free” university.                          As Paulo Freire continually
warned:
Education
is not neutral; educators are accept the status quo or oppose it.  The current
changes in the administration of universities affect not only faculty and
students, but society more broadly because they alter the very nature of the
educational experience.  The panel, comprised of historians, activists, and
adjuncts, will offer a variety of perspectives on this salient topic.
        To extrapolate from Marx, in a postindustrial economy education
constitutes an essential factor of production and, as such, illuminates the
operation of political and economic power in this neoliberal moment.  Labor
conditions among higher education faculty mirror national trends for many
workers – minimal-to-no job security, low pay, few benefits, and little room
for advancement.  Not surprisingly, women and people of color are
disproportionately excluded from stable jobs.  Further, since most faculty now
teach without the financial and intellectual protections of tenure threatens,
academic freedom is threatened and the university no longer serves as a public
sphere for the open exchange of ideas. <br />
        All of this speaks to the political contentiousness of education, its
meaning, and purpose.                        The financial precariousness of faculty
is
deeply
enmeshed with the increasing precariousness of education itself.   As colleges
come to depend more on more on faculty that occupy positions of both financial
and intellectual insecurity, and faculty governance collapses, the foundations
of democracy in our society are seriously undermined.</p> </p>
