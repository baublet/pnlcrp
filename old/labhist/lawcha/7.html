<h4>“The Question of ‘Self-Determination’”: HUAC Investigates the Specter of Cross-Border Communism in Texas, 1938-39</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The creation of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in spring
1938 coincided with a wave of Communist Party (CP) activism in Texas toward
unifying Mexican Americans and their organizations. This campaign sparked fears
among anticommunists of the northward infiltration of communists from Mexico
over a period of tolerance for the Party there during the leftist presidency of
Lazaro Cardenas. The CP did not create this activism, which was fostered by the
consular offices of Mexico in Texas, but it did actively seek to co-opt it. The
stated goals of the consular project were the uplift and unity of Mexicans
living in Texas to achieve both their well-being there and also aid, and in
some essential skills cases return, to Mexico. Anticommunists feared that the
permeable border would enable circulation of communists, including possibly
thousands of returning Spanish Civil War veterans of the international brigades
offered a home by the Cardenas government. Would an independent state of
Mexican Americans closely allied with Mexico emerge during a revolutionary
crisis? HUAC alarm over this possibility predates the escalation of
anticommunism over fall 1939 to summer 1941 during the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
HUAC investigation into fears of Mexican, not just Russian, communism and the
potential radicalization and unification of the largest minority group of the
Southwest, while African American activism escalated in the Southeast, inserts
the southern border as a key component of our understanding of race and region
in the evolution of anticommunism.</p> </p>
