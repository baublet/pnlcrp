<h4>The Construction of the Social Collectives and Social Roles: The Silent Majority in China’s Urbanization</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a large scale but often neglected marginal population in Chinese
cities. They are scattered in large and small cities and are connected every
day by common daily life. Few notice them or feel their existence, but when the
Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn festival come, and with them vacations,
urban areas notice that life is more inconvenient without them. Nearly every
single building and road in China has been built by them. They are supposedly
the most respected group in the country. However, in reality, they lack basic
social security, they suffer from the limitation of the household registration
system (Hukou), and they are worried about their children's educational
prospects. There is a special derogatory term for them-- "peasant workers."
This group comes from major historical developments as in the early years of
China’s opening-up and reform, the main body of this group were young farmers
who went to the city to seek jobs so as to earn a living. Often as "floating
population", or "external population," these workers exist on the margins of
prosperity, incapable because of legal, cultural, and social biases to become
fully integrated into their new urban setting, but differentiated from the
rural workers who have always remained in the countryside. According to
statistical data from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission,
China's floating population was 253 million in total in 2015. This vast group
accounts for approximately 20% of China's population, often appearing as hot
topics for mass media, newspapers, and academic research. Typically, their
plight is associated with polemics denouncing the Hukou system of China, a
legal system that designates people as rural or urban dwellers, and which is
often associated with the social problems of people being unable to settle,
access social welfare, and gain education. This presentation is an exploration
of these workers, the Hukou system, and how popular polemic works have done
little to understand the underlying problems of China’s migrant population.
Examining the history of the Hukou system, this paper explores the deeper
issues at play in popular biases toward these rural workers, and concludes that
in order to gain a deeper understanding of workers around the world we first
must understand the complex, and ever changing nature of urban planning, slum
developments, and the more important cultural biases that contribute to
marginalization. There is no denying that until today the fate of these
migrants and their city dreams has been uncertain. Therefore, in keeping with
this conference’s theme of global analysis, this article aims to utilize
their case so as to analyze the impact of the construction of social
collectives and roles on different social groups from an interdisciplinary
perspective. This is done in hope to regain the attention of both academics and
common readers to the issues vulnerable and specific workers face in places
like China and around the world.</p> </p>
