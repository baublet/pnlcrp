<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Will Jones, University of Minnesota. </p>

<p>“Public Employee Unions and the Black Middle Class”
It is increasingly recognized that, as Michael B. Katz, Mark J. Stern, and
Jamie J. Fader wrote in 2005, “Public employment . . . has been the principal
source of black mobility, especially for women, and one of the most important
mechanisms reducing black poverty.”  Far less attention has been paid,
however, to the role that unions played in driving that mechanism.  Starting in
the 1930s, and particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, African Americans emerged
as leading proponents and the principal beneficiaries of unionization in the
public sector.                                            Drawing on research in four
cities,
Will
Jones
considers
the
impact their efforts on the rise of the “new black middle class” in those
decades.</p>

<p>“The Crisis of the Black Working Class: The Continuing Search for
Racial-Economic Equality in Memphis and the South”</p>

<p>Black workers struggled for and made powerful economic advances through both
labor and freedom movements from the 1930s through the 1960s. But black workers
in the South experienced a double crisis when mechanical cotton pickers
displaced agricultural workers and mechanization and globalization shut down
factories in the cities. As more educated and politically involved African
Americans advanced as the result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting
Rights Act of 1965,  the fate of under educated, underpaid or unemployed
working people worsened. Black public employees made great advances through
unionization after the sanitation strike in 1968, but anti-union and white
backlash through the Republican Party have undermined the public sector in
Memphis and throughout the South.  This paper traces the growing crisis of the
black working class as movements for racial and social justice continue into
the increasingly difficult terrain of America’s racial capitalism and the
global economy in the 21st century. Using Memphis as a lens, the paper asks
what has happened to King’s dream of equality in the fifty years since 1968? </p>

<p>“The Workers and the Organizers: Toward a History of Black Women and the
Labor Movement”</p>

<p>While there are a number of studies that examine the history of black women’s
labor, there are few that focus on black women’s labor activism or offer a
national picture of the scope and trajectory of black women’s forays into
labor activism. Keona K. Ervin’s paper will outline key approaches to framing
a synthesis that stretches from the late nineteenth century with domestic
worker and black female prisoner organizing to factory workers’ campaigns in
the post-industrial, late twentieth century. Such a history resists
uncomplicated categorization because women foregrounded expansive and inclusive
visions of worker control and made effective use of alternative mechanisms that
at times called into question the union’s efficacy as a vehicle of social
justice. Finding multiple ways to form a collective relationship with their
employers, black women labor activists devised struggles that mobilized their
communities to support the fight for for workers’ basic living concerns,
racial justice, and women’s rights. Integrating black women’s involvement
in the mainstream labor movement and a broader narrative of black women’s
worker organizing can serve as a useful frame. By this approach we can
reimagine the history of American labor activism.</p> </p>
