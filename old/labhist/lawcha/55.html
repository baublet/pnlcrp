<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel casts the U.S.-Mexico borderlands as a region of unbalanced struggle
for workers, organizers, immigrants, and Border Patrol officers. It considers
the borderlands as both a tightly integrated and deeply divided region united
by capital and labor flows but separated by the geopolitical division of
national borders. John Weber examines the activities of Laredo-area Border
Patrol agents in the 1920s who trafficked European immigrants into the U.S.
from Mexico while simultaneously ignoring undocumented Mexican migration in
deference to agricultural interests. Andrew Hazelton explores the careers of
Clemente and Federico Idar, two brothers who organized for the American and
Mexican labor movements during the 1920s as part of their broader efforts to
improve conditions for Mexican-descended people in the borderlands. Looking to
the 1960s, Tim Bowman analyzes the efforts of Antonio Orendain, whose negative
experiences in the La Casita Farms strike in Starr County made him cynical
about the organizing potential of South Texas and stifled his advocacy in later
decades. Sonia Hern√°ndez, author of Working Women into the Borderlands (Texas
A&amp;M University Press, 2014), offers comments.</p> </p>
