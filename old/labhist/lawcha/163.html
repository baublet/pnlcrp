<h4>“Finnishing the History of the 1910s Pacific Northwest Lumber Wars”</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper will provide a brief overview of the key events and themes of the
1910s labor upsurge in lumber, easily the Pacific Northwest’s largest
industry. It will focus special attention on the central place of Finnish
immigrant men and women in the making of the great 1917 Lumber Strike, the
post-strike efforts to maintain the Northwest Industrial Workers of the World
(IWW, or Wobbly) movement, and the violent repression experienced by strikers
and their supporters. In so doing, I will be exploring the internal politics of
the IWW lumber workers’ movement, looking at how identities of race, gender,
ethnicity, and politics were negotiated by the radical group, and how those
negotiations shaped the boundaries of union, socialist, and Wobbly movements in
the Pacific Northwest.        It concludes that the 1917 strike and subsequent IWW
struggles were the product of years of previous labor and left-wing organizing,
which, in several Northwest lumber towns communities, was based among Finnish
immigrants.</p>

<p>A close examination of Finnish workers’ activism during the Pacific Northwest
labor conflicts yields richer and more accurate understandings of labor
relations in the Northwest’s biggest industry during the early twentieth
century. Additionally, emphasizing the place of women Finnish radicals will
help restore Finnish-American working people to the center of Pacific Northwest
labor and women’s history.</p> </p>
