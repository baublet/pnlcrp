<h4>Pacific wage war: Divergent Labor Standards and Minimum Wage issues in American Sāmoa</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Until 2009, the StarKist Samoa cannery was the largest tuna factory in the world and Chicken of the Sea &#40;COS&#41; was the second largest fish processor and exporter across the globe. Both of these canneries were located in American Sāmoa &#40;AS&#41;. Their products &#40;whether packaged for Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, or Albertsons&#41; were labeled “Made in the USA” because AS is an unincorporated territory of the United States. But as an unincorporated territory of the United States, federal labor laws do not apply equally, such as minimum wage and maximum work hours. This allowable divergence in work standards due to colonized status, as well as tax and tariff breaks, cheaper freight, lower insurance, and close access to fishing waters, has made AS an attractive liminal political-legal and economic space for the tuna canning industry throughout the second half of the twentieth century. However, in 2007, the U.S. Congress passed a federal law that required a 50-cent wage increase every year until AS wages were at the same level as the continental United States. When the first mandatory increase was instituted in 2007, the minimum wage for cannery workers in AS increased from $3.26 to $3.76. That same year, the lowest legal wage in the continental United States was $5.85. By 2009, the continental U.S. minimum wage was $7.25.  After three 50 cent increases, COS announced the closure of its cannery in 2009. Overall employment in AS fell by 19 percent and cannery work decreased by 55 percent. This paper will examine the debates surrounding the minimum wage issue in AS and the impact that variable labor standards has had in American Sāmoa. </p>
