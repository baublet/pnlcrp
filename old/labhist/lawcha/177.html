    <p>□ “Regardless of Color”:The American Socialist Movement and African
Americans between 1876 and 1890
Labour historians such as Philip S. Foner argue that during the Gilded Age the
American socialist movement - especially the Socialist Labor Party – was
“oblivious” to the problem of race discrimination. Socialists, according to
Foner, failed to understand that African Americans’ reality of discrimination
was structurally engrained in the social fabric of the ex-Confederate States,
and that, consequently, it required socialists to work out exceptional measures
in order to fight for their aim of universal equality (Foner 1977). My paper
challenges this orthodoxy, critically engaging with scholars such as Foner in
order to shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between
socialism and race at the turn of the century. By critically examining
German-language socialist sources - something that is lacking from current
studies - I will track down debates on the race question amongst SLP members,
explaining the different positions within the party. Socialists such as the
black teacher Peter H. Clark and Adolph Douai correctly understood that race
discrimination and class exploitation had a mutual correlation. Others saw the
scourge of racial discrimination against blacks but argued that only class
struggle and the achievement of the Socialist Commonwealth could deliver racial
equality. Some others, finally, justified blacks’ discrimination adopting
scientific racialist and social Darwinist approaches that proved, in their
opinion, the biological inferiority of blacks. It is my contention that the
concept of “scales of struggle” is extremely useful to shed light on the
strengths and limits of socialists of the time. On the one hand, a key
shortcoming of the SLP was its failure to organise African Americans in the
South, something that was at least in part caused by the structural weakness of
the party’s Southern sections and their inability to create connections with
black workers’ communities. On the other hand, only by adopting a
transatlantic analytical perspective, which considers the strong connections
between the German and the American socialist movements, it is possible to
understand how American socialist racial thought developed in this period. In
sum, by placing the Gilded Age American socialist movement in a context that
considers its different “scales of struggle”, my paper will offer a
reassessment of the complex relationship between socialism and race in a key
moment for the history of the multiracial American working class.</p>

<p>□ “A Union of All Reforms": The Industrial Congress and the
Antislavery-Labor Alliance, 1845–1860
The relationship between the early American labor movement and abolitionism has
often been portrayed as fraught with tension and mutual animosity, a hostility
that sometimes spilled over into violence in such episodes as the
Anti-abolitionist Riots of 1834 and the Draft Riots of 1863. Indeed, labor
reformers and abolitionists were often in conflict with one another over such
issues as economic inequality, race, and the legitimacy of wage labor in an
evolving capitalist economy. But out of the discursive debates over slavery,
labor, and political economy in the 1830s and 40s emerged, I argue, a degree of
cooperation and coalition-building between labor reformers and abolitionists
that has been largely overlooked by most of the recent literature on
antislavery as well as the newest work on “capitalism and slavery.” Land
reformers, trade unionists, ten hours-law supporters, abolitionists and early
socialists made common cause in the pre-Civil War Industrial Congresses, held
between 1845 and 1860 and hailed by progressives of various stripes as a
“union of reformers” that would help to bring about what they referred to
as an “integral emancipation,” liberating workers from both chattel and
wage slavery.</p>

<pre><code>While the Industrial Congresses ultimately fell far short of these
</code></pre>

<p>overly sanguine expectations, they did lead to an unprecedented gathering
together of the representatives of various reforms, as well as to a tentative
but transformative political alliance between working-class land reformers
affiliated with the National Reform Association and the antislavery Liberty
Party. In keeping with the theme of “Borders and Coalitions,” I propose to
examine the impact of this alliance in the context of the political
realignments bought about by the aftermath of the Mexican-American War and
Wilmot Proviso and the heightened internationalism of the revolutionary year
1848. The advent of an aggressive slaveholder expansionism and the prospect of
the loss of formerly “free soil” to slave plantations provided the catalyst
for an unprecedented degree of cooperation between antislavery and pro-labor
forces. While the alliance between labor reformers and the Liberty Party was
short-lived, it resulted in an unprecedented and perhaps never-replicated
free-labor experiment between abolitionist Gerrit Smith and landless workers,
both black and white, in New York City and State. Although the Industrial
Congresses lost much of their momentum by the early 1850s, the representatives
it gathered and the ideas they propounded ultimately contributed to the
ideological and social base of the new Republican Party. After the war, the
Industrial Congresses would be once again revived to serve as a vehicle for a
reanimated labor militancy.</p>

<p>□ “Driven to Desperation:” Race, Navassa Island, and the Problem of Free
Labor in the Nineteenth Century
My paper uses the 1889 uprising on Navassa to complicate our understandings of
the transition from slave to “free labor” at the end of the nineteenth
century. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, the Navassa Phosphate Company lured
African-Americans with promises of high wages, company housing, and benefits.
The reality failed to live up to these lofty promises; in fact, The New York
Times proclaimed that the company’s employees were in effect “slaves.”
The events of 1889 focused national attention on the island, the company’s
employment practices, and galvanized labor and civil rights activists.</p>

<p>□ Labor Ideology and the Local Politics of Chinese Exclusion: The 1885
Chinese Expulsion in Tacoma, Washington Territory
The expulsion of the Chinese community from Tacoma in 1885 was a prominent
event in the wider anti-Chinese politics of the late 19th-century United
States. This paper focuses on the labor ideologies espoused by key figures in
the expulsion, including in particular the city mayor, Jacob Weisbach, who led
the year-long campaign that culminated in the forced removal of all Chinese
residents. By combining arguments tied to labor republicanism, a
producer-controlled economy, and the threat of Chinese “slavery,” the
expulsion reveals how the egalitarian rhetoric of labor radicalism could be
turned to endorsing the repressive racial politics that integrated European
immigrants into a white republic. The prominence of the mayor, a German
immigrant and radical, further reveals how a local labor-based political
coalition could frame anti-corporate and race-based politics as a unified
vision in the face of an emerging industrial order, in this case embodied in
the power of the Northern Pacific Railroad that dominated the city's economy.
Understanding how such politics played out in Tacoma is not just a matter of
tracing a representative experience, however, but instead points to the need to
see how concrete political actors drew upon and modified inherited conceptions
of racial hierarchy in response to specific economic and political conditions.</p> </p>
