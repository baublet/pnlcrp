<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Class in Session: Teaching Labor History Through Digital Tools
Students learn best when we invite them to be scholars and researchers. My
presentation explores some of the techniques and sources I have been using to
“flip the classroom” in labor studies courses at UW, Tacoma. These sessions
of class utilize digital resources and open-source archives to engage students
in various topics in the study of work and labor history. I want to highlight
two projects in particular. The first utilizes Social Explorer, the online
prescription database tool, which my students have utilized to create an
economic report card of their region for the past three years. The second
project invites students to create and revise topics in Wikipedia. To date, the
majority of entries concerning labor strikes during the Great Depression were
created by my students at UW and UW, Tacoma. These kinds of assignments help
students transcend the boundaries of the campus and lends gravity to the
otherwise abstract concepts we teach in the classroom.</p>

<p>□  Labor and Digital Media: Organizing the "Creative City" 
In the Spring of 2015, writers for the news and gossip website Gawker announced
their intention to organize with the Writers’ Guild of America East (WGAE).
Gawker’s management recognized the union without any resistance. Soon
thereafter writers at other digital outlets, from Vice Media to Salon to The
Huffington Post, sought and gained union recognition, some joining up with
WGAE, others with the NewsGuild, and most through a routine card check.
Observers saw in this burst of organizing an important sign of life for
organized labor, not least because it involved a demographic thought to be
immune to the attractions of trade unionism.</p>

<p>This paper takes a step back. First, I map this burst of organizing onto the
transformation of the political economy of the news media. Then I examine the
history of unionization in the cultural industry and in journalism to draw out
the themes—such as the running tension between the romance of the writer’s
life and the need for economic security, between an accommodating
professionalism and a more oppositional trade unionism—that might best inform
an understanding of the present situation. Finally, I will shift the
perspective a bit. Since many of these workers are indeed young and
college-educated, those “creative class” types that thanks to Richard
Florida have fired the early 21st century urbanist imagination, does
unionization in their ranks represent a new scale of struggle in the
neo-liberal city? And how might it fit in with current efforts to re-think
organized labor more generally?</p>

<p>□  Unions &amp; Social Media
Recent shifts in socioeconomic discourse have been widely perceived as opening
up potential opportunities in a widespread union renewal effort. Given the
digital media expansion that has run concurrent with labour’s decline, it
seems clear that any potential shift toward a more dynamic and influential
union movement will not only require significant social and ideological
changes, but an active role on the part of labour activists and academics in
the understanding and use of social media. This presentation will provide an
overview of the academic research that has been done on unions’ use of social
media and will highlight the challenges faced by the labour movement in
utilizing social media as a means of expanding their profile and perceived
significance to those sectors that could benefit from a larger role for labour.
Finally, this presentation will explore potential lessons for the labour
movement that can be drawn from research on social movements’ use of social
media.</p> </p>
