<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel features three very different approaches to considering the role of
working-class communities in neoliberalism’s emerging ascendancy in the 1970s
and 1980s. In his exploration of New York City’s 1970s austerity policies as
an elite reaction to racial justice activism, Michael Reagan argues that
working-class communities of color served as powerful symbols in a campaign to
undermine redistributive policies and other alternative approaches to fiscal
crisis. In Reagan’s story, working-class New Yorkers were both tools and
victims in an elite neoliberal project. In contrast, Eddie Bonilla and Marisa
Chappell ask how working-class urban residents themselves engaged with shifting
political and policy environments in the 1970s and 1980s. Bonilla explores
radical leftist Chicano activists in California whose inability to negotiate
the evolving complexities of gender and immigration status in the
postindustrial labor market left them without an effective political strategy.
Chappell, on the other hand, explores low-income activists’ engagement in
both challenging and contributing to narratives of ownership and choice that
fueled neoliberal policymaking. Taken together, the papers offer not only
different but perhaps conflicting answers to fundamental questions regarding
the role of working class actors in the emergence of neoliberal political and
policy regimes in the American postindustrial city.</p> </p>
