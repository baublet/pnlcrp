<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Working people have comprised the majority of the population in all societies
across all times and places. Over the past fifty years historians have reversed
previous decades of neglect to study and publish extensively on working class
experiences, ideas, activities, and roles in historical change. Yet,
transferring these exciting and critical stories from scholarly research to the
broader public's historical thinking has been sketchy at best. Labor and
working class history continues to be largely neglected and narrowly episodic
in standard history curriculum. Why is this the case? What is and can be done
to reintegrate the history of work and working people into the history they
made?</p>

<p>This panel will address these questions by examining developments at the state
and local levels, where history curriculum are developed, shared and taught. 
Panelists will explore specific efforts by government and non-government groups
to bring workers and labor history into history teaching and learning –
including formal inclusion in state teaching/learning standards, in recommended
content topics, and the creation of lesson plans, curricular units and resource
lists.</p> </p>
