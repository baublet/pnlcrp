<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  A Worker Writes History?
I have been working on a social history of Colorado coal miners in the 1920s
and an account of the 1927-28 Colorado miners' strike since 1982. I am not an
academic and I do not have academic experience; I have done my research and
writing as a union organizer and left activist, a worker and as someone whose
family members and friends worked in the mines. Most of my research has been
done with Colorado miners and their families and most of these people are now
deceased. Certain questions have arisen from my research: can the assembly
forms of workers' organizations be made relevant today? how do we understand
and work with the pivotal people and institutions which make workers' mass
movements possible? how do we understand the connections and lack of
connections between workers' (sub)cultures, work communities and communities
and our ability and willingness to act? How do workers live between dramatic
moments of heightened class struggle? These questions have arisen from my study
of Colorado miners in the 1920s, and I think that I am finding answers. More
broadly, other questions have arisen as well as I have done my work: can an
"ordinary" worker write working-class history? what do union activists get out
of labor and working-class history? why do we do working-class history and how
do we communicate the "why" of this to other workers? Does Brecht's poem "A
Worker Reads History" have meaning today?</p>

<p>□  Combating the Klan: Constructing Radical Identity in Southern Illinois
My work examines how the radical immigrant miners of Franklin County, Illinois
preserved radical sentiment in southern Illinois during the mid 1920s, despite
the decline of both the coal industry in the region and radicalism within the
United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). In particular, this paper focuses on the
grassroots activism and interethnic solidarity displayed by union miners from
southern Illinois at the 42nd annual convention of the Illinois Federation of
Labor in 1924. A number of mining representatives disrupted the proceedings and
demanded that the conference openly denounce the Ku Klux Klan and their use of
terrorism within mining communities. Despite the prevalence of Klan attacks on
union members, the miners met heavy opposition from the UMWA hierarchy present
at the convention. This was due to not only the political influence held by the
KKK in the area, but also the southern Illinois organizers’ affiliation with
the Communist party. The dispute at this convention spoke to the presence of a
divided working class in southern Illinois that often erupted in violent
conflicts based on ethnic identity, national origin, and radical affiliation. I
contend that the events at this convention informed the next decade of labor
disputes in the coalfields of Franklin County, in which the UMWA consistently
neglected the needs of their immigrant members and left them exposed to
repression at the hands of the coal operators, the KKK, and the courts. This
paper differs from previous literature in that it pertains to trade union
activism during the 1920s, which is a period often neglected by labor
historians. Additionally, the majority of the existing literature neglects
thorough analysis of Franklin County radicals, despite the remarkable window
that they provide into the everyday realities and tribulations of immigrant
miners during the 1920s.</p>

<p>□  Coal Miners and Class Identity in the Japanese Labor Movement: 1912-1928
The historiography of the Japanese labor movement in the early 20th century has
typically adopted a simplistic narrative, pitting the burgeoning union movement
against state and corporate efforts to ameliorate the so-called “labor
problem” through appeals to industrial harmony. Within this narrative
framework, the fate of an already-formed working class was determined through
legislation, company reforms, and violent encounters. However, the mobilization
of the working class by labor leaders, itself a contentious process demanding
the articulation of a shared class identity, remains unexamined in these works.</p>

<p>My paper analyzes the challenges faced by local labor activists as they
attempted to foster and articulate class identifications through an analysis of
the works of two activists from the coal mining region of Chikuhō in southwest
Japan: Mitsuyoshi Esshin and Hashimoto Eikichi.</p>

<p>Both Mitsuyoshi and Hashimoto are notable for being former coal miners who
joined Japan’s national labor movement. Both were committed to mobilizing
Chikuhō’s miners in the wake of increasingly violent unrest in the region.
However, they faced a challenge in articulating a class identity for miners
that both integrated the latter into the larger labor movement while appealing
to existing regional and occupational identities. The resulting works betray an
underlying tension between their affirmation of a class identity that crossed
occupational boundaries and their tendency to ground their narrative of social
revolution in the specificities of mining life. Consequently, in mobilizing
their personal histories and intimate knowledge of mining work, both writers
often reinforced claims that Japan’s miners possessed a unique occupational
culture, which was simultaneously being used by industrialists to legitimize
paternalistic management practices and challenge state or union intervention.</p>

<p>My paper thus explores two themes that permeated coalition building and class
mobilization efforts in Japan. Firstly, it analyzes the tension between
particularity and universality in class discourse. Secondly, it emphasizes the
permeability of class identity itself and the indeterminacy of its
articulation, especially in non-Western contexts.</p> </p>
