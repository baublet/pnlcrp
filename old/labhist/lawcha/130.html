<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Workers in the belligerent countries faced contradictory pressures during World
War I as their nations slid into war and demanded ever-increasing loyalty. 
Caught between intensifying nationalism and residual internationalism, faced
with volatile wartime labor and housing markets and persistent pockets of
unemployment, burdened by sharply rising prices and food shortages, threatened
with unprecedented levels repression and harassment of war opponents, not to
speak of military conscription itself, workers and their movements (both trade
unions and political parties) responded differently.  These contradictions
deserve closer examination in local contexts and specifically in the urban
crucibles in which the war pressures were most acutely felt.
       This session will explore and compare these contradictions and the
evolving patterns of opposition and repression in specific cities in the United
States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia.  By moving beyond the
political machinations of national parties and parliamentary elites, we may see
more clearly the cross pressures of daily life in wartime with which city
workers were faced and the often difficult political choices they made.</p> </p>
