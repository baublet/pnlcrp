<h4>The Frontlines of “Global” Movements: Re-considering Working-Class Struggle in the “Anti-Globalization” Movement</h4>

<em>Eric Larson</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>How did working-class organizations participate in the Global Justice, or
“Anti-Globalization,” movements of the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly
in the U.S. context? Most scholarship on the movement has focused on
non-governmental organizations, advocacy networks, and direct action
collectives. This paper re-considers this scholarship in light of the
activities of the Jobs with Justice coalition, a U.S.-based working-class
coalition that sought to expand labor unions’ work with the networks of
activists and organizations confronting sweeping neoliberal economic reforms.
Like many grassroots groups that collaborated in the massive protests and
world-scale fora of the era, the unions and organizations that led the Jobs
with Justice coalition were frontline organizations, since they directly faced
the consequences of multilateral trade agreements and the new policies of the
World Trade Organization. Jobs with Justice, in trying to “localize global
justice” to better respond to working-class needs, sought to re-adjust the
scales of struggle to win concrete local battles even as relating struggles to
transnational networks. This paper is based on interviews and archival work in
local Jobs with Justice offices as well as in collections at the AFL-CIO and
several key protest sites. It directly relates to the conference theme of
Scales of Struggle, and also speaks to sub-themes of War and Empire, Borders
and Coalitions, and Struggling for Justice.</p> </p>
