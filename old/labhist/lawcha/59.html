<h4>Combating the Klan: Constructing Radical Identity in Southern Illinois</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>My work examines how the radical immigrant miners of Franklin County, Illinois
preserved radical sentiment in southern Illinois during the mid 1920s, despite
the decline of both the coal industry in the region and radicalism within the
United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). In particular, this paper focuses on the
grassroots activism and interethnic solidarity displayed by union miners from
southern Illinois at the 42nd annual convention of the Illinois Federation of
Labor in 1924. A number of mining representatives disrupted the proceedings and
demanded that the conference openly denounce the Ku Klux Klan and their use of
terrorism within mining communities. Despite the prevalence of Klan attacks on
union members, the miners met heavy opposition from the UMWA hierarchy present
at the convention. This was due to not only the political influence held by the
KKK in the area, but also the southern Illinois organizersâ€™ affiliation with
the Communist party. The dispute at this convention spoke to the presence of a
divided working class in southern Illinois that often erupted in violent
conflicts based on ethnic identity, national origin, and radical affiliation. I
contend that the events at this convention informed the next decade of labor
disputes in the coalfields of Franklin County, in which the UMWA consistently
neglected the needs of their immigrant members and left them exposed to
repression at the hands of the coal operators, the KKK, and the courts. This
paper differs from previous literature in that it pertains to trade union
activism during the 1920s, which is a period often neglected by labor
historians. Additionally, the majority of the existing literature neglects
thorough analysis of Franklin County radicals, despite the remarkable window
that they provide into the everyday realities and tribulations of immigrant
miners during the 1920s.</p> </p>
