<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The post-Stonewall gay rights movement of the 1970s formed successful
communities of support and cultural liberation, especially in urban centers
along the east and west coasts. But by 1977 a virulent national network of
political backlash was on the move. Campaigns fueled by religion-based fear
pressed to rescind all LGBT civil rights reforms and to support sanctions
against employment of LGBT workers in education and social services. 
        The religious right made gains in some communities and regions, but was
not as strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, where resistance was vigorous.
There, queer communities included revolutionary leftists whose organizations
affirmed sexual self-determination. Independent issue-oriented lesbian groups
organized their own community-based actions and educational programs as
expressions of their socialist ethics. 
        Starting with the Coors Beer Boycott in 1974, organized labor in the
Bay Area made common cause with union-minded queer activists. LGBT labor
coalitions grew in other regions, including the Pacific Northwest, where during
the 1980s and 1990s queer unionists rallied with labor to defeat right-wing
anti-gay electoral initiatives that would threaten the livelihoods and safety
of LGBT union members.</p> </p>
