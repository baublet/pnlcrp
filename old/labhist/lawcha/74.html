<h4>The Triumph of Credentials: Professional Work and Inequality in Progressive-Era Boston</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper explores professionalization as a political strategy of job control
in the early 20th century U.S. at multiple "scales": the city, region, and
nation. As craft union control was undercut, middle-class Americans pursued
“professional” strategies of control through advanced schooling. Local
degree-granting colleges and universities reoriented themselves to provide
training for the traditional professions such as law and medicine, as well as
the “new professions” of business management, engineering, and education.
Through regional and national forms of accreditation, formerly local elite
institutions regulated and set the standards for the most prestigious
credentials and highest-paid work. This is one chapter of a larger dissertation
on the transformation of training for work across the employment structure in
the city of Boston from 1870-1940, and its implications for social inequality
at the national scale. While class conflict drove a "race to the bottom" in the
mutual regulation of apprenticeship by unions and employers, preventing the
national coordination of training for industry, the very different political
configuration of white-collar and professional training drove a “race to the
top” of educational credentials. While an expanding system of decentralized
local school systems allowed many to enter white-collar jobs, the triumph of
credentials primarily benefited a new, nationally-connected, educated elite.</p> </p>
