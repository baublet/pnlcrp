<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Recent scholarship has shown how Latina/o experiences in the United States are
shaped by national origins, governmental reception, regional economies, and
local demographics. This panel builds upon that literature by providing three
diverse case studies that illustrate the experiences of different Latino
groups, more specifically the women in these communities, through the lens of
work and labor relations in the mid-twentieth century. In the disparate
locations of Grand Rapids, Michigan, Miami, and Philadelphia, labor served as
the hub around which these communities accumulated economic, social, and
political capital, and through which they built identities.  Work determined
the areas in which they lived, the institutions they interacted with, and the
activities they engaged in outside of work.  Latinas actively sought to engage
and affect their environments as they adjusted to local circumstances and
created survival strategies for themselves and their families. While the bulk
of Latina/o labor history has centered on rural experiences in earlier decades,
this panel focus on life in urban centers during the Cold War era and
deindustrialization.</p>

<p>The subjects of Delia Fernandez’s study of West Michigan encountered a labor
market that did not allow for families to fit comfortably within
urban/industrial and rural/agricultural divides.  Starting in the 1940s and
through the 1970s, Latinas challenged these artificial divisions through the
planning and executing of seasonal adaptation, split households, and regional
mobility as they contributed to their family economies.  So too, the presence
of Cuban exiles in Miami reshaped local labor markets and welfare provision.
Mauricio Castro demonstrates how Cuban exiles, particularly women, leveraged
their experience and educational backgrounds and took advantage of an
unprecedented level of federal largesse throughout the 1960s and into the early
1970s. These aid programs helped establish the Cuban community’s power in
South Florida while simultaneously serving as a social laboratory for federal
work education and welfare programs. In Philadelphia, Puerto Rican and African
American workers faced a rapidly deindustrializing landscape. Organized women
workers responded in part by challenging their union leadership throughout the
1970s. By supporting diverse candidate slates in union elections and balking at
union officials’ decrees, these workers took on local neoliberalization and
sought to create more equitable and inclusive work sites. </p>

<p>In each of these circumstances, Latina/o workers confronted large economic and
political questions with impacts far beyond Michigan, Florida, and
Pennsylvania. How could working-class people survive in a piecemeal labor
market? How should the government assist with job training and placement? How
could workers influence huge economic transformations through local venues?
Relatively recent migration patterns and ethnically segmented labor markets
disproportionately exposed Latina/os to shifts in the structural forces
undergirding urban economies. This panel thus provides telling examples of how
everyday people adjusted to changing economies and social realities in the
middle of the twentieth century.</p> </p>
