<h4>Strikes, Comprehensive Campaigns and the Revival of the Labor Movement</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper troubles the assertion that reviving the strike is labor’s primary
strategy for union renewal. It beings with the understanding that unions have
been successful when they developed forms of resistance that take into account
how employers are structured and how they operate in the context of the state. 
Strikes constituted a successful union tactic in the early part of the 20th
century given their ability to exert economic pressure on relatively simple
firms. By mid-century firms were becoming increasing complex, but the post-war
labor accord established a legal and political framework around the strike – 
which was a regular feature of the post-war industrial relations system. With
firms increasingly taking on post-modern forms the contestation of power today
is often not on the picket line or the plant gates which raises the question if
strikes are automatically the appropriate form of resistance. Given the
complexity of 21st century firms, one cannot assume that any one tactic (such
as the strike) is appropriate without extensive corporate research to identify
how power flows in a firm and its potential vulnerabilities. The real promise
of comprehensive/strategic campaigns is the utilization of deep corporate
research to build multifaceted campaigns that draw from structural,
institutional, associational and symbol power that operate at a number of
different scales. In this way comprehensive campaigns can create new
opportunities for militancy that the strike cannot.</p> </p>
