<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Not a labor town: Transforming Labor and Gender Politics in a
Deindustrialized City?
What factors strengthen worker claims in labor-hostile cities? A case study of
a 21st century nurses’ strike sheds light on this question. On Friday March
31st, 2000, approximately 535 nurses at St. Vincent’s Hospital and Worcester
Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts went on strike against Tenet
Healthcare Corporation over issues related to staffing and pay. The strike
lasted 49 days and had broad support, including that of local and state
lawmakers. When the strike concluded with satisfactory provisions on key
issues, it was widely deemed a win for workers. In fact, that win gave strength
to nurse organizing on safe staffing and mandatory overtime issues across the
U.S. Despite this success, conventional wisdom remains that Worcester, once a
diverse manufacturing center, is not a city that is friendly to labor. In this
case study I analyze local, regional, and trade news coverage to offer a
contextualized understanding of the factors that facilitated community support
for this influential strike. In particular, the paper explores the ways in
which the gendered, classed, and racialized notion of nurses as professionals
and as care providers – for individuals as well as for communities – was
deployed to situate these workers as altruistic advocates. While such
strategies facilitate labor gains in the short term, they risk reproducing
social divisions and inequalities that may limit their impact in the long term.</p>

<p>□  “Hard Times at the Cooker:” The Struggle to Save Chicago’s Public
Hospital
My paper explores the impact that disinvestment and privatization had on staff
and patients at Cook County Hospital during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and
the movement they formed in response. In the 1970s, Chicago’s economy, like
that of the nation’s, had collapsed while medical costs skyrocketed. Facing
pressure from the state, Cook County enacted a series of austerity policies.
Officials laid off nurses’ aides and clerical workers and reduced the number
of hospital beds. When the County contracted out the hospital’s management to
Hyatt Medical Management Enterprises, Inc. in 1980, the subsidiary of the Hyatt
Hotel Corporation sent collections agencies after patients. Deteriorating
working conditions and health care delivery moved the hospital community to
action. Medical professionals, hospital workers, and community members
mobilized their unions and formed the Committee to Save Cook County Hospital to
defend the public institution that was integral to the livelihoods and health
of many.</p>

<p>□  This is NOT a Local Campaign: Protest Movements in the Post-Liberal Era
The United States’ abandonment of the liberal welfare state model of the
mid-twentieth century has had drastic impacts on the American working classes.
Attempts to turn public property into private profits through austerity,
privatization, and de-regulation not only greatly expanded corporate power,
they also re-shaped nearly every aspect of American life, from policing and
education to the environment and the workplace. But while corporate power has
become increasingly concentrated in the last several decades, corporate
vulnerabilities have been decentralized through global supply chains and
increasingly complicated methods of outsourcing and subcontracting. These
shifts have altered the ways that protest movements can pressure those in
power.</p>

<p>My paper presentation explores these dynamics through two fascinating case
studies in which Americans at the political margins were forced to build
large-scale coalitions to pressure local opponents on national and
international levels. The first was a decade-long campaign to convince the
University of Arizona to select a less ecologically vulnerable location for a
new telescope complex. As the project’s many backers were revealed throughout
the late 1980s and early 1990s, the campaign expanded from a small coalition of
American Indian activists and environmentalists to an international pressure
campaign targeting dozens of college campuses in the US and Canada, the
Smithsonian Institution, and the Vatican. The second case study was a four-year
campaign by Florida farm workers to force Yum! Brands, the largest restaurant
corporation in the world, to change its labor policies. By the time the boycott
concluded, there were active affiliates at 300 American high schools and
colleges, and students at twenty-two schools had successfully ousted Taco Bell
franchises. Through these stories, I outline some of the complexities of the
economic and political shifts of the post-1960s period, as well as how these
changes have impacted the efforts of protest movements.</p> </p>
