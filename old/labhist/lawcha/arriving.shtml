				<p class="style20" align="center">Transportation to Residence Hall or UW Campus</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Lander Hall, the residence hall where many are staying (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lander+Hall,+1201+NE+Campus+Pkwy,+Seattle,+WA+98105/@47.6556596,-122.3171995,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549014f3ba755af3:0x942b03c21f9cc45e!8m2!3d47.655826!4d-122.3148976">1201 NE Campus Pkwy</a>), is next door to Alder Commons where we are holding the Thursday night welcome reception and plenary and a few blocks from the UW campus and Mary Gates Hall where  sessions will meet Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</p>
				
			 <h2 align="left">From the Airport to Lander Hall and University District Hotels</h2>
				<p><strong>Taxi and Shuttle Express  Service:</strong> Taxi (25 minutes) and Shuttle Express are located on the 3rd  floor parking garage of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.portseattle.org/seatac/ground/" target="_blank" title="Sea-Tac International Airport">Sea-Tac International Airport</a>. Taxi will cost about $50 and Shuttle Express $24.75. Tips are expected on both.</p>
			  <p><strong>Light Rail/Bus Service:</strong>
              Light rail (called Link) is direct from airport to UW campus but the UW station is a Â¾ mile walk from Lander Hall where many are staying. It is much closer to Mary  Gates Hall where most conference sessions will be held. To get  to Lander from  Sea-Tac International Airport, the trip involves both light rail and buses  (separate tickets) and will take at least one hour. Follow airport signs to Link  light rail system heading north to Seattle. Pay the fare before boarding Link  light rail. Exit at any of the downtown Seattle transit centers (International  District/Chinatown, Pioneer Square, University Street and Westlake). Purchase  bus ticket and board a northbound bus #71, 72 </p>
