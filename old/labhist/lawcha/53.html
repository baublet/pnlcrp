<h4>Labor Ideology and the Local Politics of Chinese Exclusion: The 1885 Chinese Expulsion in Tacoma, Washington Territory</h4>

<em>Charles Williams</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The expulsion of the Chinese community from Tacoma in 1885 was a prominent
event in the wider anti-Chinese politics of the late 19th-century United
States. This paper focuses on the labor ideologies espoused by key figures in
the expulsion, including in particular the city mayor, Jacob Weisbach, who led
the year-long campaign that culminated in the forced removal of all Chinese
residents. By combining arguments tied to labor republicanism, a
producer-controlled economy, and the threat of Chinese “slavery,” the
expulsion reveals how the egalitarian rhetoric of labor radicalism could be
turned to endorsing the repressive racial politics that integrated European
immigrants into a white republic. The prominence of the mayor, a German
immigrant and radical, further reveals how a local labor-based political
coalition could frame anti-corporate and race-based politics as a unified
vision in the face of an emerging industrial order, in this case embodied in
the power of the Northern Pacific Railroad that dominated the city's economy.
Understanding how such politics played out in Tacoma is not just a matter of
tracing a representative experience, however, but instead points to the need to
see how concrete political actors drew upon and modified inherited conceptions
of racial hierarchy in response to specific economic and political conditions.</p> </p>
