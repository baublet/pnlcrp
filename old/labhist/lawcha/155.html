<h4>Radical Religion: The Catholic Church and the War on Poverty in Brooklyn</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Catholic Church was (and remains) defined by boundaries – between
parishes, dioceses, and priests and parishioners. By the late 1960s, those
boundaries were also racial and political. The majority of Catholic
parishioners were white and conservative, but a small and active contingent of
black Catholic churches emerged to challenge the politics of their
coreligionists. This paper will examine the alliances that arose to overcome
parish and racial boundaries in Brooklyn and, in particular, how a contingent
of “radical” priests and nuns allied with liberal white Catholics, black
and Puerto Rican Catholics, community activists, and like-minded organizations
to spearhead a number of progressive programs – including non-profit housing
corporations and welfare rights organizations – that were inspired by the
Gospel but performed in the streets of the city. Significantly, the majority of
these efforts were made possible through the Great Society’s Office of
Economic Opportunity, as well as a “diocesan war on poverty.” This paper
thus explores the combined efforts of the Church and the state to intervene in
systems of poverty and discrimination, but also chronicles their ultimate
failures. We are rich in histories of the Great Society from the perspective of
politicians and bureaucrats, but this paper provides a grassroots perspective
of the community institutions that carried out the OEO’s mission – from its
well-funded initial outburst to its slow withdrawal that crippled progressive
organizations. This paper will argue that the Catholic Church is an exemplary
case study for examining the failures of the War on Poverty because it allows
historians to view the program in microcosm, revealing how progressive,
interracial efforts to alleviate poverty were abandoned to fund those that, as
one Brooklyn Catholic argued, would not disrupt “the sanctity of the status
quo.” The Church, like the state, failed to truly challenge the boundaries of
inequality in American cities.</p> </p>
