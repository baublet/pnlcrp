<h4>The Role of the Precariat Sociologist in Transforming Academia</h4>

<em>Sarah Grunberg</em><br>
Ithaca College

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Abstract</p>

<p>This short personal memoir of my life as an adjunct in a sociology department
addresses the lived condition of the precariat in higher education today and
calls for the academic community generally, and sociologists specifically, to
become more publicly and actively engaged with revolutionary solidarity and the
fight to transform higher education. While sociologists often speak abstractly
about concepts such as C. Wright Mills’ Sociological Imagination, this
article challenges contingent and non-contingent professional scholars to apply
this knowledge to their own lived experiences in academia. As contingent
workers, we are caught in a state of false consciousness, believing that our
job market chances are based on our individual achievements and ability to
“market ourselves”, rather than on a system that is more invested in our
exploitation than it is in our, or our student’s, futures.  </p>

<p>How can we “do” sociology without actively challenging and changing the
systems that oppress us as workers and as human beings? Sociology teaches that
collective action can be effective. The adjunct professor can move toward
empowerment. As such, this memoir also concerns my experiences in labor union
organizing at my college and solidarity in activism surrounding racial and
economic justice with my undergraduate students in our fight against the
hierarchies of college administration and the corporatization of higher
education. This is accomplished through the application of sociological thought
to my own position in academia and my fight to bring a voice to marginalized
individuals who have the least amount of power and authority in an institution
where governance and decision making power is left to the disconnected few.</p> </p>
