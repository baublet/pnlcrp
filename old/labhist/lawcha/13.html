<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>As scholars of labor and working class history, our research addresses the
people who comprise the largest proportion of the population in any given time
or place. In an age of rapidly intensifying economic disparity and an increase
in workers who "vote against their interests," labor and working class
historians are especially positioned to address some of the most pressing
issues of our age. Despite these facts, however, the fields of labor and
working class history seem to suffer from the same "decline" as the working
class itself. Why?</p>

<p>We propose to hold a roundtable discussion in which a younger generation of
working class and labor scholars assess the field in an effort to answer this
question. Our panel will discuss what scholars have done right, where we can
improve, and how we should develop the field to the benefit of the historical
discipline as a whole. It is our hope that this panel will stimulate deeper
thought and conversation among our colleagues and lead to changes that can
renew interest and appreciation for working class studies.</p> </p>
