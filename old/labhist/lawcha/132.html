<h4>“Badly Need[ed]…Capital”: Organized Labor, Trade Policy, and Visions of Globalization at the end of Bretton Woods</h4>

<em>Andrew Elrod</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Amid the historic fracturing of the American political system during Nixon's
second term, it was business leaders and administration officials who embarked
on an ambitious journey to open investment and trade markets abroad, including
in the Communist countries. The Trade Act of 1974 was instrumental in this
strategy. The attachment of American union leaders to an anti-Communist foreign
policy kept them looking backwards, opposed to international collective
bargaining in Europe, bereft of solutions to the problems of global economic
integration. Their inability to bargain over employer investment decisions and
the historic weakness of American full-employment policies left protectionism
as one of the only tools to maintain domestic employment. For these reasons
labor found itself opposed to détente, confronting an administration
portraying investment regulations—capital controls—as not only illiberal
diplomacy, but as restraints on domestic economic growth and full employment.In
the minds of C. Fred Bergsten, Pete Peterson, and other cabinet officials
including George Shultz, Herbert Stein, and William Simon, capital mobility,
the destabilizing force of the Bretton Woods system, would become the new basis
of world economic integration. The remarkable success of their program would
have a lasting impact on the tone and inflection of American liberalism in the
late twentieth century.</p> </p>
