<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the 1955 merger of the AFL and the CIO, the development of mutually
valuable, enduring partnerships between the country’s major labor federation
and community allies has been elusive. Especially in recent decades, they have
typically been charitable in nature – whereby labor mobilized support to
local communities in the face of natural disasters (hurricanes, floods) or
basic need shortages (food banks, book fairs); or where designed to provide
support to the unions, they have been highly transactional – soliciting
one-time assistance from the community in the context of a pending labor
dispute (a strike, a city hall rally, legislative lobbying), generally with
little effort to build or nurture an ongoing relationship that transcends the
particular crisis in question. For the most part, these charitable and/or
transactional relationships have failed to strengthen either partner: they have
neither led to lasting gains for unions, nor have they sustained, much less
added to the effectiveness of, movements seeking lasting social, racial, or
economic justice.</p>

<p>Even the Federation’s occasional engagement in broad, issue-based coalitions
(e.g. around trade, labor law reform) and the relationships it has maintained
with other progressive national organizations (e.g. NAACP, LCCR), have too
infrequently resulted in sustained alliances marshaling their combined power to
influence societal change. </p>

<p>Over the past decade, beginning with the AFL-CIO’s worker center
partnerships, continuing with its prominent role in the community-labor CLEAN
car wash worker campaign in Los Angeles, and taking root most recently in its
restructured, “impact”-based national partnership with United Way, the
Federation has sought to transform its community partnerships to ones that more
effectively blend its institutional assets with the social movements for
lasting change that its community allies are promoting. </p>

<p>The moderator, who will lead the discussion, and the other panel members, each
of whom has played an active role in the transformation of the AFL-CIO’s
relationships with community allies, will address the nature and the
significance of these changing trends, and the potential that this has to offer
much greater strength and effectiveness to labor-community coalitions.</p> </p>
