<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>While many studies have considered the carceral state as a job site for both
inmates and corrections officers, this panel goes beyond conventional paradigms
to consider the many ways in which struggles over access to work, identities as
workers, and labor relations shaped prison labor programs and litigation in the
twentieth century. This panel shows that labor was central to claims on
prisoner rights and to workers’ return to society after incarceration. Amanda
Hughett’s paper concerning the 1970s alliance between the American Civil
Liberties Union National Prison Project and the North Carolina Prisoners Labor
Union reveals the limits of litigation in addressing prison labor and prisoner
rights’ issues writ large. In an examination of a worker retraining program
in Cook County Jail, Melanie Newport addresses how vocational education offered
misdemeanant offenders new lives as workers after their incarceration while
rationalizing the increased incarceration of ever larger numbers of poor people
in 1970s Chicago. Finally, Morgan Shahan explores the development of parole
policy and practice in early 20th century Illinois, revealing how employers
ensured a steady supply of cheap labor for bosses willing to commit to aiding
parolees in their quest to “make good.” Together, these papers show the
range of struggles incarcerated people engaged in while behind bars and upon
their release.</p>

<p>Melanie Newport is an Assistant Professor of US history at the University of
Connecticut—Hartford. She is currently working on a book, Cook County Jail:
Racism, Violence and the Dangerous History of Jail Reform. Looking to one of
America’s largest jails, she explores how contests over reform, human rights,
and race came to constitute everyday experiences of state violence among
marginalized people in American cities from the 1950s to the present. Newport
is also interested in histories of money bail; the focus of her second research
project is how criminal courts, reformers, and bail bondsmen developed legal
technologies to set the price of freedom for people accused of crimes in the
modern US. She holds a BA from Pacific Lutheran University, an MA from the
University of Utah , and a PhD from Temple University. Newport’s research has
been supported by the Black Metropolis Research Consortium, the University of
Chicago, and the Center for the Humanities at Temple. </p>

<p>Morgan Shahan is a PhD candidate in 20th Century U.S. history at Johns Hopkins
University. As a social and cultural historian, she is broadly interested in
the intersection of social movements, race and racism, and the carceral state.
Her dissertation, tentatively entitled “Managing Deviancy: Parole, Probation,
and Carceral Development, 1895-1939,” concerns the development and evolution
of probation and parole laws and policy from the Progressive Era to World War
II. With this work, she hopes to trace the creation and illustrate the
implications of a new legal, social, and political category that lay between
institutionalization and the enjoyment of ex-prisoners’ ability (however
circumscribed) to navigate free society unsupervised. Raised in the San
Francisco Bay Area, she holds a B.A. in History from the University of
California at Berkeley and an M.A. from Johns Hopkins. Her research has been
supported by the Illinois State Historical Society and Johns Hopkins
University. </p>

<p>Dan Berger is Assistant Professor of History at University of
Washington-Bothell. He is an interdisciplinary historian focusing on critical
race theory, twentieth century U.S. social movements, and critical prison
studies. He is the author of Captive Nation: Black Prison Organizing in the
Civil Rights Era, which won the 2015 James A. Rawley Prize from the
Organization of American Historians, The Struggle Within: Prisons, Political
Prisoners, and Mass Movements in the United States, and editor of The Hidden
1970s: Histories of Radicalism. Rutgers University Press, 2010.</p> </p>
