<h4>The Elusive Postwar Boom: Metro-Detroit Autoworkers, 1945-1960</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>There was no boom for Detroit autoworkers in the fifteen years after World War
II.  Recessions, automation, decentralization, and the collapse of independent
automakers in are part of the story, but materials shortages (including during
the Korean War), steel strikes, copper strikes, supplier strikes, wildcats,
overproduction (especially in 1955), hot weather, cold weather, plant
explosions, age, race, and gender discrimination, and the inability of
autoworkers to afford new cars were constant contributors to this instability. 
No one in the 1950s—whether ordinary autoworkers, union leaders, auto company
executives, business analysts, or local shopkeepers—thought that the decade
was marked by steady work, improving wages, or anything resembling
predictability for autoworkers.  This presentation would be drawn from my book
manuscript currently under contract and under review with the University of
Illinois Press.  (Rather than repeating this as a formal paper proposal, I've
uploaded below a version of a paper on this topic that I presented at the
Newberry Library.)</p> </p>
