<h4>Not a labor Town: Transforming Labor and Gender Politics in a Deindustrialized City?</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>What factors strengthen worker claims in labor-hostile cities?              A case
study of
a 21st century nurses’ strike sheds light on this question.  On Friday March
31st, 2000, approximately 535 nurses at St. Vincent’s Hospital and Worcester
Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts went on strike against Tenet
Healthcare Corporation over issues related to staffing and pay.  The strike
lasted 49 days and had broad support, including that of local and state
lawmakers.  When the strike concluded with satisfactory provisions on key
issues, it was widely deemed a win for workers.  In fact, that win gave
strength to nurse organizing on safe staffing and mandatory overtime issues
across the U.S.  Despite this success, conventional wisdom remains that
Worcester, once a diverse manufacturing center, is not a city that is friendly
to labor.  In this case study I analyze local, regional, and trade news
coverage to offer a contextualized understanding of the factors that
facilitated community support for this influential strike.  In particular, the
paper explores the ways in which the gendered, classed, and racialized notion
of nurses as professionals and as care providers – for individuals as well as
for communities – was deployed to situate these workers as altruistic
advocates.  While such strategies facilitate labor gains in the short term,
they risk reproducing social divisions and inequalities that may limit their
impact in the long term.</p> </p>
