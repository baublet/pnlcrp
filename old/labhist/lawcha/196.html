<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Part-time Faculty and Collective Bargaining Outcomes
Controversy swirls over the extent to which faculty unionization benefits
part-time or contingent faculty. Many contingent faculty are dubious that
bargaining units controlled by full time or tenure track faculty do or can
represent their interests. Indeed, not all tenure track faculty embrace the
idea of regularizing appointments for contingent faculty or improving their
conditions lest that weaken the institution of tenure or the conditions tenured
and full time faculty experience. However, very little data analysis has been
presented in order to indicate contemporary outcomes related to contingent
faculty. By merging several data bases including the National Center for the
Study of Higher Education's Directory of Collective Bargaining we are able to
begin assessing some outcomes including the extent to which results diverge
where contingent faculty are a) not represented b) where they are including in
general units with tenure track faculty, and c) where they create separate
units. Where the data allows, this paper will focus on earning and upon the
reliance of institutions upon part-time faculty.</p>

<p>□  The Winds of Changes Shift: An Analysis of Recent Growth in Bargaining
Units and Representation Efforts in Higher Education
This presentation will include an analysis of completed and pending questions
of representation in 2016 involving faculty in higher education. The 2016 data
demonstrates that the rate of newly certified units at private colleges and
universities far outpaced new units in the public sector.  The presentation
will also examine the private and public sector legal principles underlying the
composition of faculty bargaining units, i.e., whether tenured and tenure track
faculty should be in the same or separate bargaining unit, and how the1980 
Yeshiva University decision continues to impact faculty unionization and unit
composition at private colleges and university. </p>

<p>□  Building Union Power: Contract Fights, Budget Battles, and the Future of
the University
This paper examines the California Faculty Association's transition to Social
Justice unionism which fights for the rights of contingent labor as well as
being advocates for our students, fighting for resources for our institutions,
to resisting corporatization/privatization of our universities, and fighting
for racial justice. In recent years we have fought back against student fee
increases, we have successfully challenged legislative efforts to allow private
vendors sell their online courses to the university system as for credit
courses, we have joined the efforts of Ethnic Studies faculty to preserve and
expand ethnic studies in our system, and we have negotiated a contract provided
important economic and non-economic gains for both non-tenured and tenured
faculty.</p> </p>
