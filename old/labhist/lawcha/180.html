<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Blue-Collar Cosmopolitans: Sailors, Pullman Porters, and Working-Class
Sophistication in the Industrial Era
The term “cosmopolitan” is rarely used in relation to working-class people.
Yet some with broad perspectives and travel experience appear to qualify for
the label – the globe-trotting immigrant, the well-read deep water sailor,
the African American Pullman Porter, the socialist militant. Long before
current notions of “globalization,” such workers linked their local
communities with the broader world. Judging from autobiographies, some sailors
were not only more widely-traveled, but also often better-read than middle
class people. Aside from their cosmopolitan experience and perspective,
maritime workers occupied a vital place in labor history, as they often
provided the links required for transnational social and political movements.
Likewise, Pullman Porters helped to spread Black freedom movement literature
and ideas, connecting activists as they traveled through cities around the U.S.
The socialist machinist’s or garment worker’s personal life may have been
circumscribed by their factory walls and city neighborhood, but with the rise
of socialist movements, her/his worldview, political goals, and strategies were
inherently transnational. In placing such experiences in relation to our
understandings of the cosmopolitan, we not only illuminate the lives of these
workers but also broaden our notions of the cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>□  A Great Vision: An Activist Family’s History in the Fight for Social
Justice
Personal accounts by people who have directly experienced historical events can
provide vivid and empathetic insights into history. Typically such accounts in
the form of memoirs encompass the life span of one individual.
Multi-generational family histories that comprise multiple voices are very
rare. This presentation synopsizes one such work, my recently-released book
“A Great Vision” published by Hardball Press. There is the rich oral
tradition of my family’s narrative, of our Old World struggles as Croatian
nationalists resisting nascent Italian fascism in the turbulent northern
Adriatic region, our immigration story and arrival in industrial Chicago. A
vivid picture of life in the midst of 1930s organizing efforts emerges out of
the extensive excerpts from oral history interviews with my father Herb March,
a key organizer of Chicago’s packinghouse workers, and personal experience
stories from my mother Jane March, an initiator of the Back-of-the-Yards
Neighborhood Council. The tragic story of the fates of my three uncles who, in
the depths of the Great Depression, after a decade in the USA, returned to
Europe to join an American-founded commune in the Soviet Union provides a
glimpse into the little-studied phenomenon of migration of Americans to the
USSR. How family values of struggle were conveyed to ensuing generations is
revealed in the account of my own participation in the civil rights, peace, and
student New Left movements in Los Angeles, Berkeley and Mississippi, and of my
niece Sara’s principled stand as a tree-sitting environmental activist in
northern California. The family story is useful to historians and imbued with
relevant issues such as trans-nationalism and gender dynamics.</p>

<p>□  Chilean Exile Activists in Seattle:  Solidarity Across Borders
From the late 1970s to the present, the Seattle area’s political culture has
been influenced by Chilean activists whose influence outstripped their
relatively small numbers. Between 1976 and 1979, some forty Chilean families
came to Seattle, part of an international diaspora fleeing the dictatorship of
Augusto Pinochet, who had participated in a 1973 coup against Chile’s elected
president, with support from the CIA and Nixon-Kissinger Administration. Over
the years, many of these exiles worked to restore democracy in Chile by
supporting popular organizations there and by reshaping US policy and public
awareness. “Chileans for Democracy” (CFD), founded in Seattle in 1984 and
built on precursor organizations, built coalitions with religious, human
rights, labor, leftwing, and Latin American solidarity activists in the city
and beyond. They influenced Seattle not only by drawing attention to Chilean
politics but by recreating aspects of Chilean culture in public events. The CFD
contributed to change in Chile, including a 1988 plebiscite against Pinochet,
and his replacement by an elected president in 1990. In the early 1990s the CFD
dissolved, though many individuals continued community and transnational
activism. Members came to live what historian Dirk Hoerder has termed
“transcultural lives” that bridge “competing cultures” and “permit
moves and linkages” between them. This presentation will discuss the history
of Seattle’s Chilean exile community and a project to preserve their history
in the Labor Archives of Washington State (LAWS) at the University of
Washington Libraries Special Collections.</p> </p>
