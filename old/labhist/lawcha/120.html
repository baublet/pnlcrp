<h4>Part-time Faculty and Collective Bargaining Outcomes</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Controversy swirls over the extent to which faculty unionization benefits
part-time or contingent faculty.  Many contingent faculty are dubious that
bargaining units controlled by full time or tenure track faculty do or can
represent their interests.  Indeed, not all tenure track faculty embrace the
idea of regularizing appointments for contingent faculty or improving their
conditions lest that weaken the institution of tenure or the conditions tenured
and full time faculty experience.  However, very little data analysis has been
presented in order to indicate contemporary outcomes related to contingent
faculty.  By merging several data bases including the National Center for the
Study of Higher Education's Directory of Collective Bargaining we are able to
begin assessing some outcomes including the extent to which results diverge
where contingent faculty are a) not represented b) where they are including in
general units with tenure track faculty, and c) where they create separate
units.        Where the data allows, this paper will focus on earning and upon the
reliance of institutions upon part-time faculty.</p> </p>
