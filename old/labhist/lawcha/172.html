<h4>Paper: "Black Railroad Shopmen, the 1922 Strike, and Civil Rights Struggles in Texas"</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Railroad shop work is one relatively unexplored vein of African American
working-class history. Shop towns and cities dotted the US landscape, and, in
the South, black workers often dominated unskilled and semi-skilled shop
positions. Most accounts of black shopmen are national or southern in scope.
This paper anchors its study in Texas, but especially Marshall, Texas, where
the Texas &amp; Pacific employed hundreds of black and white men in its sprawling
railroad shops complex. News coverage of the 1922 national railroad shopmen’s
strike, along with census and city directory records and oral interviews,
allows a partial reconstruction of black shop workers’ participation in the
1922 conflict and thus their relationships with each other, white unionists,
the federal government, and their broader community. In 1922, black shop
workers took exceptional risks, on both sides of the strike divide, at a time
when the prospect of progress was fast receding. Their efforts underline the
influence of black wartime protest and activism, the unique aspects of labor
and race relations in the shops, and the rooted life led by many black shopmen
and their families. This history has the potential to generate fresh
investigation of the roots and nature of the civil rights movement in shop
towns such as Marshall, a center of 1960s-era civil rights activism in Texas.</p> </p>
