<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Historians, sociologists, demographers and scholars in other fields have taken
greater notice of the rapidly increasing presence of Chicanx throughout the
United States. Chicanx form a majority of the overall Latino population, which
has become the largest under-represented group in the nation.  Indeed, there
are significant Chicanx communities in all fifty states.  In addressing this
phenomenon, this panel will address specifically the historical and current
conditions of Chicanx beyond the well-studied Southwestern United States and
focus on the Pacific Northwest.  The papers have a multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary focus, addressing colonialism, gender, history, immigration,
labor, literature, sociology, education, and religion. This panel builds on the
historiography of the Chicanx presence in the Pacific Northwest and examines
various forms of resistance, community mobilization, culture and how people
negotiated their precarious position in regions that lacked a critical mass of
Chicanax. More important, the panelists illuminate how Chicanx overcame their
racialization, marginalization, and isolation in the Northern Borderlands by
using their sense of identity and the search for social justice.</p> </p>
