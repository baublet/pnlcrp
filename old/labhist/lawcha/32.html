<h4>Creating a City to Resist the State: The Seattle General Strike of 1919</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Seattle general strike of 1919 was a remarkable moment in the process that
Eugene Holland characterizes in Nomad Citizenship as a slow-motion general
strike.  The Seattle general strike rose out of the immanent historical
practices of Seattle’s labor communities as they interrupted state and
capitalist formations and instead organized to govern themselves. Defying the
conservative national leadership of their own unions as well as Seattle’s
bombastic governmental and economic elites, these workers organized themselves
into a viable alternative structure for making and carrying out decisions
necessary to running the city. The writings of the strike’s historian, Anna
Louise Strong, and of the “two-card men” whose dual union membership
combined the fight to improve existing conditions with the larger struggle for
a better world, both reflect and create a constructive dissidence that still
resonates today.
The Seattle general strike ended on February 11.  Yet perhaps it did not.  I
suggest that Seattle’19 can still be available to us as an example of Eugene
Holland’s idea of affirmative nomadology, an opportunity to distill
principles and practices for organizing ourselves outside the confines of
capital and the state.                          Holland encourages us to identify
assemblages of
resonating processes that serve as relays for material and political
operations. Seattle’19, I argue, is a resonating moment within Holland’s
imagining of  “a long-term process of becoming-general of the general
strike.” (p. 156)</p> </p>
