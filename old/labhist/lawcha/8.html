<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In recent decades, the largest factories in history have been built in China
and Vietnam.  Some sprawling shoe and electronics plants employ 100,000 workers
or more, housing tens of thousands in adjacent dormitories.  These industrial
behemoths have been the sites of repeated labor conflicts, including a strike
at a shoe factory in Ho Chi Minh City that involved 90,000 workers, one of the
largest single-site strikes in history.  The outsized factory – factories
larger and more advanced than other contemporary facilities, that mark the
forefront of industrial development – have been built repeatedly since the
first English textile mills in the late eighteenth century.  Over and over
again they have been associated with visions of modernity and utopia, while
often sites of intense labor exploitation and conflict.</p>

<p>This paper will compare contemporary factory giants with earlier episodes of
industrial giantism, including English and American textile mills, U.S. steel
factories, Ford’s Highland Park and River Rouge plants, the “gigant”
factories of the Soviet Union’s First Five Year Plan (like the Stalingrad
Tractor Factory and the Magnitogorsk steel complex), and the Nowa Huta Lenin
steelworks in post-World War II Poland.  It will discuss the economic and
political reasons for building such very large scale factories, the differences
and similarities of giant factories under capitalist and socialist regimes,
their cultural role as emblems of modernity, and how workers experienced being
at the heart of the largest industrial facilities of their age.  The talk will
be accompanied by images of industrial giantism through the years.</p> </p>
