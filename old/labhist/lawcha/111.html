<h4>Organising Community: Hotel and Restaurant Unionisation and Community-based Radicalism in 1930s Minneapolis</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper examines intersections between community struggles and unionism by
focusing on the attempts of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) to
organise in Minneapolis in the late 1930s and early 1940s. HERE Local 665
organised on an industrial basis the miscellaneous workers who held low-status
jobs within the hotel and restaurant industry, such as maids, kitchen and
laundry staff and cafeteria workers, positions that were mostly held by women
and African-Americans in a famously white city. Unionists spread 665 both
through tactics of salting within the workplace, and through a nexus of
communities that had been built up by radicals and ethnic groups throughout the
1930s. 665 would then contribute back to these broader struggles, using its
position on the Farmer-Labor Association and the AFL Central Labor Body of
Minneapolis to press for left policy and support the nascent Civil Rights
movement. In examining the history of 665, I will bring out the often complex
relationships between race, gender, community and union organisation in 1930s
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>This paper is part of a broader project focusing on the development of
third-party labor politics in Minnesota. The Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party held
office from 1930-38, and is thus widely regarded as the most successful third
party in US history. My work seeks to reconceptualise the relationship between
the party and broader radical movements in Minnesota at that time. I argue that
it was this connection with outside radical communities that provided a base
for a working-class political organisation. This chapter, on 665, will provide
a case study of this relationship. By focusing on a service workers union,
dominated by women and African-Americans, I seek to broaden the image of
working-class people who participated in radical politics. While labor
historians have lately put considerable focus on service work, the image of the
Farmer-Labor Party remains resolutely traditional; the (white male) producerist
manufacturing worker to complement the (white male) producerist farmer. This
paper seeks to contribute both to a new conception of working-class politics,
and to uncover potentialities for connections between local community activism,
labor, and political organisation.</p> </p>
