<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The McClellan Committee hearings (1957-1959) raised public concern about the
issue of union corruption and made the leadership of the Teamsters Union a
notorious symbol of the problem of labor racketeering.                               </p>

<p>Allegations
of
corruption involving Dave Beck were followed by a series of other high profile
hearings that focused on his successor James Hoffa and a group of other local
Teamster leaders, such as Don Peters, who shared Hoffa’s willingness to adopt
aggressive union organizing tactics, and his apparent willingness to work with
men who had mob ties.  The AFL-CIO responded by holding a parallel set of
investigations, run at the behest of its own Ethical Practices Committee and
intended to demonstrate the labor movement’s ability, and willingness, to
deal with the problem of corruption within its ranks.                               </p>

<p>These
papers
offer
a
fresh look at that history, providing an alternative perspective by offering
new research on the history of Teamster leaders spotlighted by the McClellan
Committee and by exploring the behind-the-scenes mechanics of the AFL-CIO’s
Ethical Practices Committee.  </p>

<p>Robert Donnelly’s paper, “Teamster Boss: Dave Beck,” argues for a
revisionist perspective on the Seattle labor leader, challenging the one-sided
depiction of him that emerged in the McClellan Committee hearings and which has
come to predominate in almost all subsequent accounts.                               </p>

<p>Donnelly’s
account
will place Beck firmly in the context of Seattle’s labor history.</p>

<p>Liesl Orenic focuses her paper on the organizing activities Don Peters, the
dynamic Chicago labor leader, whose Teamsters Local 743 became the subject of a
McClellan Committee probe.  Orenic’s research offers a more complex
understanding of the aggressive organizing tactics that the McClellan Committee
tagged as “racket picketing.”  </p>

<p>Catherine Rios and David Witwer draw on AFL-CIO records to document the
federation’s effort to mount an anti-racketeering purge that would respond to
the revelations of the McClellan Committee.  In doing so the Ethical Practices
Committee revealed the distinctive Cold War framework in which this history
unfolded as well as the limitations facing a non-governmental anti-corruption
effort.</p> </p>
