<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Radicals and the Democratic Party: Independent Political Action or Bore From
Within, 1876-2016</p>

<p>The question of whether to work outside or within the Democratic Party is one
that has long faced working-class radicals. In the absence of a national labor
party in U.S., the question has acted as a plague on working-class movements
due to its divisiveness. While some radicals view the Democratic Party as where
movements go to die, others see working within the party as part of the
political reality of the two-party system. The papers in this panel evaluate
the tactics of radicals working both within and independent of the Democratic
Party from the 1880s to the present.</p> </p>
