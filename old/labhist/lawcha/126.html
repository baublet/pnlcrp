<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Energy is so fundamental to our lives that we often take it for granted. But
each time we flip a light switch or fill our cars with gas, we enter a chain of
relationships connecting us to the workers, businesses, and natural forces that
produced the power we expect to harness. Historians have long recognized the
importance of those networks, but the political and environmental challenges of
our time make them even more salient. As human-induced climate change inches
toward catastrophe and the shifting geography of natural resource extraction
fosters economic insecurity and political resentment among working people, a
growing number of scholars are searching for new ways of understanding the
history of energy. </p>

<pre><code>    This panel contributes to that trend by presenting three studies of
</code></pre>

<p>work, labor relations, and politics in the oil and coal industries. In papers
that range from the early twentieth century to the 1980s, we examine forces
that shaped conflicts on the local, national, and global scale. Through her
study of oil production in the Texas Permian Basin, Sarah Stanford-McIntyre
argues that working-class drillers developed an intimate knowledge of ecology
and geology. That expertise not only provided a sense of power and prestige for
workers in a dangerous and rapidly changing industry, but also bolstered
ambivalent attitudes toward the environmental consequences of their work.
Likewise, Jon Free shows how growing concern over fuel shortages in the early
1970s impacted coal miners’ efforts to control their workplaces through
democratic revolt. The energy crisis—which Free argues predated the 1973 OPEC
oil embargo—both increased and limited miners’ negotiating power, as the
Miners for Democracy and wildcat strike movements butted against financial
imperatives at the heart of the business of coal mining.                       </p>

<pre><code>    By examining the nexus of work, business, and energy on various scales,
</code></pre>

<p>our papers combine insights gleaned from generations of labor and working-class
historians with new perspectives afforded by environmental studies, critical
geography, and the history of capitalism. Thus this panel points toward a
deeper and more nuanced understanding of power; one that acknowledges the
contingency and conflict embedded in the most elemental aspects of human
history.</p> </p>
