<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Labour in the Global Carnival Against Capital
Though not the first of such events, the ‘Battle of Seattle’ late in 1999
was the seen as the coming out party for the anti-corporate movement. Where was
labour in this important new movement? Did unions participate in blockading the
citadels of corporate global power? Evidence from case-studies of four of the
‘summit-hopping’ episodes (Seattle November-December 1999, Melbourne
September 2000, Quebec City April 2001 and Genoa July 2001) suggests strong
working-class involvement, especially of white-collar workers from the public
sector, and important contributions from union activists and particular radical
unions as organizations, white-collar and blue-collar, public and private.
However, in some cases trade union officialdom at higher levels preferred union
contingents keep a safe distance from centres of action. Such reticence did not
present the union movement in the best light to anti-corporate activists; and
it revealed significant tensions within unions between militant,
class-conscious activists and more co-opted and conservative officials.</p>

<p>□  The Frontlines of “Global” Movements: Re-considering Working-Class
Struggle in the “Anti-Globalization” Movement
How did working-class organizations participate in the Global Justice, or
“Anti-Globalization,” movements of the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly
in the U.S. context? Most scholarship on the movement has focused on
non-governmental organizations, advocacy networks, and direct action
collectives. This paper re-considers this scholarship in light of the
activities of the Jobs with Justice coalition, a U.S.-based working-class
coalition that sought to expand labor unions’ work with the networks of
activists and organizations confronting sweeping neoliberal economic reforms.
Like many grassroots groups that collaborated in the massive protests and
world-scale fora of the era, the unions and organizations that led the Jobs
with Justice coalition were frontline organizations, since they directly faced
the consequences of multilateral trade agreements and the new policies of the
World Trade Organization. Jobs with Justice, in trying to “localize global
justice” to better respond to working-class needs, sought to re-adjust the
scales of struggle to win concrete local battles even as relating struggles to
transnational networks. This paper is based on interviews and archival work in
local Jobs with Justice offices as well as in collections at the AFL-CIO and
several key protest sites. It directly relates to the conference theme of
Scales of Struggle, and also speaks to sub-themes of War and Empire, Borders
and Coalitions, and Struggling for Justice.</p>

<p>□  “Made in the USA?”: Resisting Sweatshops in the 1990s
My paper examines the 1990s, as a significant period of anti-sweatshop activism
in the United States. During this decade activists fought many of the same
challenges as in previous eras, but adapted to a new landscape, with an
increasingly mobile and global sweatshop industry. As parts of a larger
anti-globalization, pro-worker, and pro-environment movement taking place at
the turn of the century, these activists forced the means of production back to
the forefront.</p>

<p>□  N.A.F.T.A. (Not A Fair Trade for All)
From the many works I have done as part of my "N.A.F.T.A..." series, I will
select a few to project with commentary about them including quotations of
workers, activists with an emphasis on cross-border solidarity.</p> </p>
