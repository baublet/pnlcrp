<h4>The Fraternal Tradition and the Global History of the Knights of Labor</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The history of international labour movements during the nineteenth century is
generally told in a certain way. Socialists, anarchists and trade unionists
from different countries came together in a variety of networks, movements and
organisations to win strikes, regulate migration, and agitate for political
change across national borders. The First and the Second Internationals were
the largest and best-known of these movements. </p>

<p>Has this narrative obscured other trends and traditions in that story? This
paper will draw on my research and work into the global history of the Knights
of Labor, and on Robert Weirâ€™s groundbreaking work concerning the fraternal
side of the Knights, to think about whether we as historians have missed or
underplayed the importance of fraternal culture in our understanding of
international labour history. Fraternal orders were, after all, among the
largest organisations that catered to a working-class audience. The United
Order of Oddfellows, the Ancient Order of Foresters and other orders recruited
working-class members across the world and provided them with the social
insurance that states did not yet provide. Movements like the Knights of Labor
were also organised on fraternal lines, and secret, fraternal organisations
were present at the formation of the First International and other major global
movements. There is an entire tradition here that needs much greater
examination. </p>

<p>This paper has contemporary relevance as well. Many commentators have pointed
to a decline in solidarity at the workplace and in the community as both a
cause and effect of the decline in trade union membership. Fraternal culture,
with its encouragement of brotherhood (or sisterhood) through shared ritual,
once fulfilled this function. While there is very little chance of a revival of
fraternal culture right now, we should consider other ways of building
solidarity that do not rely only on economic self-interest.</p> </p>
