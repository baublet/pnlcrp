<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Building social awareness through public event organizing: The annual Labor,
Social and Environmental Justice Fair</p>

<p>Students and faculty at California State University, Dominguez Hills put on an
annual Labor, Social and Environmental Justice Fair, led by the Labor Studies
program and the Labor and Social Justice Club. Now in its ninth year, this
event fosters awareness of economic, racial and gender struggles, and how the
labor movement intersects and supports social justice. Students take an
organizing and service learning class to spearhead the event, network with
faculty and students to create a social justice fair with labor at its core.
Fifty organizations, half of which are labor unions and workers centers, set up
booths to interact and inform college students and the several hundred high
school students we bring, about their rights and opportunities to get involved
in social change. Workshops provide opportunities to create in-depth dialogue
and participatory activities around social justice themes, and art and music
broaden the scope of the event. Labor unions provide the majority of the
funding for the annual event. This presentation provides an overview of the
fair as well as an analysis of how the event impacts the organizers and
participants.</p> </p>
