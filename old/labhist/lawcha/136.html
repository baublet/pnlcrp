<h4>Paper title: “Guest Workers, the Cold War, and Dreams of Development in Mexico and Spain”</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Looking back after 30 years of service to Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the distinguished diplomat Jaime Torres Bodet pondered his most
consequential policymaking endeavor: the 1942 negotiation of the bilateral
agreement that permitted millions of young Mexican men to leave their families
and communities each year to harvest American crops.  Known as the Bracero
Program, the accord last more than 20 years and became among the most
controversial policies enacted by Mexico’s post-revolutionary government. 
Its critics - both in Mexico and the USA - demonized the Bracero Program as an
exploitative labor system that benefitted American growers at the expense of
both Mexican workers and national pride.  The program’s proponents defended
it as a model guest worker accord that guaranteed basic rights for farm workers
while also serving to improve US-Mexican relations during the Cold War. 
Building upon social science research from the 1920s, its defenders also
portrayed it as a form of foreign aid in that braceros returned  home with the
hard-earned savings and newly-acquired skills to achieve the rural development
goals of the Mexican state.  Torres Bodet, for his part, admitted that
“renting out the health and vigor of a large contingent of our countryman to
foreign bosses must be seen, under any circumstances, with sorrow.”  But he
considered migration “inevitable” and thus defended a Mexican state policy
meant to defend migrants’ working and living conditions while they labored
abroad.  Himself the son of Spanish and French immigrants, the one-time
ambassador to France also likened the Bracero Program to the postwar European
guest worker accords instituted during his posting to Paris (1955-58).        From
this perspective, the Mexican braceros were no different from the Spanish
peasants who harvested crops or mined coal in postwar France and Belgium.  Many
arrived with the assistance of the Spanish Emigration Institute, the Franco-era
agency that promoted emigration to Europe’s industrial core as an official
antidote to rural unemployment and underdevelopment.  Like the Mexican
counterparts, the majority returned to a homeland undergoing rapid economic and
social change.        </p>

<p>Taking Torres Bodet’s lead, this paper examines the North American Bracero
Program from the comparative perspective offered by the migratory labor
agreements that sent millions of southern European guest workers to labor in
postwar western Europe.  Of course, such programs served fundamentally to
deliver temporary labor to agricultural and industrial employers.  But they
ostensibly served broader ends, ranging from their role in promoting economic
development in sending regions to their service as political safety valves, an
ostensible antidote to communism.  Based upon research in US, Mexican and
Spanish archives, this paper will analyze these guest worker accords in a
global and comparative perspective by analyzing the developmentalist agenda of
the sending states.  It then explores both the economic and cultural effects of
emigration and return migration in Cold War-era Spain and Mexico.</p> </p>
