<h4>The Second Line of Defense: American Women Workers and World War I</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>“WOMEN OF NATION ARE READY TO DON OVERALLS AND REPLACE MEN IN VARIOUS
OCCUPATIONS,” screamed a headline in the Grand Rapids Press (Michigan) on May
9, 1917.  The enthusiastic reporter breathlessly proclaimed that as the men
left for war “women will start work as elevator operators, elevated, subway
and street car conductors, machine shop experts, ticket agents, motion picture
mechanics and distributors, telegraphers, railway car cleaners, office clerks,
bell ‘boys,’ chauffeurs, automobile mechanics, shoemakers, bank clerks,
farm hands, railway checkers and callers, waiters in exclusive cafes, train
dispatchers, gatemen and theater musicians.” <br />
        The Grand Rapid Press was right.  World War I saw an unprecedented
challenge to the sex-segregated labor market that so limited women's work
options.  The phenomenon was much commented upon.  As women took on formerly
men's jobs, newspapers and magazines avidly reported on their incursion, often
printing photographs that featured women dressed in overalls or mannish
uniforms that underscored the ways in which they were transgressing gender
boundaries. Woman suffrage activists seized on the idea of these workers as
"the second line of defense" to bolster their arguments about women's rights to
full citizenship. Women labor leaders and reformers, especially those
associated with the Woman's Trade Union League, used the breakdown of barriers
in the workplace to call for equal pay for equal work and to articulate a
demand for what we now call "comparable worth."
        Yet despite what seemed to be a dramatic transformation, World War I
did not significantly undermine patterns of sex-segregated labor.  Ironically,
perhaps the most enduring result of the war was the expansion of feminized jobs
in the professional and clerical field.  That such “women’s work” marked
the war’s impact suggests that there were built-in limits to possibilities
for women to challenge sex segregation.  Even as they broke barriers,
traditional expectations on the part of male employers and workers, as well as
women reformers and government administrators, who mobilized to protect women
war workers, constrained opportunities both during and after the war.  This
paper explores both the promises that war seemingly offered women workers and
the powerful limits to realizing substantive progress in the struggle for a
more equal workplace.</p> </p>
