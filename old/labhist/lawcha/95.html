<h4>Chilean Exile Activists in Seattle: Solidarity Across Borders</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the late 1970s to the present, the Seattle area’s political culture has
been influenced by Chilean activists whose influence outstripped their
relatively small numbers. Between 1976 and 1979, some forty Chilean families
came to Seattle, part of an international diaspora fleeing the dictatorship of
Augusto Pinochet, who had participated in a 1973 coup against Chile’s elected
president, with support from the CIA and Nixon-Kissinger Administration.  Over
the years, many of these exiles worked to restore democracy in Chile by
supporting popular organizations there and by reshaping US policy and public
awareness. “Chileans for Democracy” (CFD), founded in Seattle in 1984 and
built on precursor organizations, built coalitions with religious, human
rights, labor, leftwing, and Latin American solidarity activists in the city
and beyond.  They influenced Seattle not only by drawing attention to Chilean
politics but by recreating aspects of Chilean culture in public events. The CFD
contributed to change in Chile, including a 1988 plebiscite against Pinochet,
and his replacement by an elected president in 1990. In the early 1990s the CFD
dissolved, though many individuals continued community and transnational
activism. Members came to live what historian Dirk Hoerder has termed
“transcultural lives” that bridge “competing cultures” and “permit
moves and linkages” between them.  This presentation will discuss the history
of Seattle’s Chilean exile community and a project to preserve their history
in the Labor Archives of Washington State (LAWS) at the University of
Washington Libraries Special Collections.</p>

<p>**NOTE:  This presentation could also be reorganized in a format with more
participants.  October 19, the author is holding a “first meeting” for the
“Chilenos en Seattle” history project with LAWS Director Conor Casey and
several of the key Chilean activists, who could likely join such a roundtable
or panel.</p> </p>
