<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>"Union Time: Fighting for Workers' Rights" is a feature-length documentary that
tells the story of one of the greatest union victories of the 21st century--the
fight to organize Smithfield Foods' pork processing plant in Tar Heel, North
Carolina. From 1993 to 2008, workers struggled against dangerous working
conditions, intimidation, and low pay.</p>

<p>Starting in 1993 the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) began an
organizing campaign at the plant that was to span 16 years. Smithfield Foods
fought the union campaign tooth-and-nail, with everything from union busters to
armed company security guards with the power of arrest to a RICO lawsuit
against the union, all to no avail.</p>

<p>The union early on aligned itself with the North Carolina NAACP and its leader
the Reverend William Barber, as well as with Jobs With Justice, the United
Church of Christ and many other progressive organizations. It also waged an
"Air War" that made effective use of social media.</p>

<p>Victory was achieved in a December 2008 election, and in July 2009 UFCW Local
1208 was created. For the 5,500 workers at Smithfield conditions have vastly
improved. In 2013 a second four-year contract was signed.</p>

<p>The key theme of "Union Time"--is that commmunity-based unionism can and did
succeed in building a groundbreaking union in one of the most anti-labor states
in the country.</p> </p>
