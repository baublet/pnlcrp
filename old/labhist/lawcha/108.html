<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel brings together four scholars whose work has examined the
experiences of workers and their unions, at different times and from different
perspectives, at the aerospace giant Boeing Company.</p>

<p>Polly Myer's work examines the familial culture of stability and belonging that
set apart the Boeing Company in its youth and the evolution of its workplace
culture in connection with social, political, and economic changes since.</p>

<p>Andrew Hedden's paper examines the responses of Boeing's largest union,
International Association of Machinists District Lodge 751, to the company's
near bankruptcy in the late 1960s and early 1970s. </p>

<p>In "Emerging from Turbulence," Leon Grunberg and Sarah Moore share in-depth
interviews with 36 recent hires, longtime employees, and retirees to create a
personal portrait of the significant changes that have occurred within Boeing
over the last ten years, what they mean to the workers they affect, and how
those changes are reshaping our attitudes towards work.</p> </p>
