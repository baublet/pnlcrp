<h4>Ludlow, Greek Americans in the Colorado Coal War (documentary film)</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Colorado Coal War of 1913-14, a class war between miners, led by the United
Mine Workers of America, and mine-owners, led by Rockefeller, is  a very
important page of Labor history.  It laid the groundwork for contemporary labor
laws and rights, not only in the US but in all the industrialized world.</p>

<p>In 1903, after a big strike of miners in Southern Colorado, the coal companies
decided to replace their English speaking work force with immigrants from 22
countries of Southeastern Europe, brought in, unknowingly, as scabs.  Ten years
later, the inhuman living and working conditions and the efforts of bilingual
union organizers,  had turned the scabs into stalwart union members, who
endured a long and violent strike and in the end took up arms to defend their
lives after the bloodbath of the Ludlow Massacre on April 20, 1914.</p>

<p>The film documents this struggle through archival interviews with strikers,
songs, photos and videos from that period and interviews with historians,
authors and descendants of strikers who proudly share their family history. For
the first time the important contribution of the Greek - and Italian - miners
in the strike is presented in this film. </p>

<p>The film has been very well received by the public and the critics since its
release this January in Greece and has received two awards until now in Greek
documentary festivals.                                              </p>

<p>This film works with several themes of the conference, in particular the main
theme of scales of struggle; it focuses on the role of Greek labor migration
and immigrants role the class conscious struggle of miners in Colorado. Global
connections, with a Greek film crew enhance these connections. Greek memorials,
including the Colorado UMWA fight song performed in Greece, make a statement
about the role of recovering memory from the past in a powerful way.               </p>
