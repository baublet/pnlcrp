<h4>Drawn to Change: Working-Class Comics as Activist Story-Telling</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>How we choose to tell stories about the past shapes our understanding of
ourselves and the power we possess to change the present and the future.
Recounting the events of the past, then, is not a neutral endeavor; it is
profoundly political. Taking inspiration from such activists as bell hooks and
Howard Zinn, the Graphic History Collective (GHC) – a group of artists,
writers, and historical researchers – blends the traditions of “people’s
history” and labor and working-class history with comics. Overall, our aim is
to use the accessible medium of comics to tell stories about labor history in
ways that can inspire workers to use the lessons of the past as a resource to
inform contemporary struggles for social change. 
   To contribute to the conference theme of “Scales of Struggle: Communities,
Movements, and Global Connections” and the sub-themes of “Struggling for
Justice” and "Public Work of Labor History," this paper will explore the work
of the GHC, focusing on our most recent project, a comics anthology: Drawn to
Change: Graphic Histories of Working-Class Struggle (Between the Lines, 2016).
Speakers from the GHC will discuss the importance and value of presenting labor
histories in accessible and creative formats, paying particular attention to
the production process and how it opens up opportunities for building
community, reaching broad audiences, and organizing in new and relevant ways. 
   We would also like to mount an art exhibit during the conference. The
exhibit will showcase samples from Drawn to Change and enable conference
attendees to view some of the work discussed during our paper.</p> </p>
