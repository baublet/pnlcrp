<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In November, 2013, the small suburban city of SeaTac passed Proposition 1,
authorizing a $15 minimum wage policy phased in over several years; after
surviving a lawsuit filed by business groups, the policy went into effect in
January, 2014.                          Six months later, the Seattle City Council
approved
a
similar
$15 minimum wage policy.  The victories in the Puget Sound catalyzed a
proliferating array of campaigns to raise the minimum wage in cities and states
around the nation as well as at the national level.  This panel will reflect on
the lessons that can be learned from the struggles by a broad coalition of
labor unions, community partners, and elected officials around a host of issues
concerning low wage workersâ€™ rights in the years following the Occupy
movement, both in Seattle and beyond. The roundtable will feature local
activists and activist-scholars involved in the minimum wage campaigns.</p> </p>
