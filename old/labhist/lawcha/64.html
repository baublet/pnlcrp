<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This panel will provide an opportunity for labor activists affiliated with LELO
(Legacy of Equality, Leadership and Organizing) to informally describe their
more than four decades of community-based worker to worker organizing. LELO is
a social movement formation that is unique to Seattle— a community based
labor organization that is part worker center, part international human rights
organization, and part non-profit organization. It grew out of an alliance
between black construction workers and Filipino cannery workers in early 1970s
Seattle, and evolved into a network of workers of color in Seattle who connect
their struggles for jobs in Seattle to worker struggles against capitalism and
imperialism around the world. </p>

<p>The panel will include participants from some of the different parts of
LELO’s activism over its more than four decades, and provide each with the
opportunity to connect the history of their activism to contemporary issues of
labor rights and social justice. 
•                    Trevor Griffey will moderate the roundtable, but will not
present.
•                    Harley Bird will describe the worker to worker organizing
of
the
United
Construction Workers Association (UCWA), which represented black construction
workers who entered Seattle’s building trades under court order. 
•                    Michael Woo will describe how the UCWA founded LELO as part
of
its
effort to develop a united front with in struggle to desegregate the American
workplace in the 1970s, working closely with Filipino cannery workers.
•                    Michael Simmons, if he is able to attend, will talk about
co-founding
LELO and helping organize eight black worker centers in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Texas and Oklahoma in 1973. 
•                    Cindy Domingo will describe the importance of LELO’s
internationalism
to its ongoing labor and human rights activism, drawing from her experience as
a longtime leader of women’s delegations to Cuba and Philippine solidarity
work.
•                    Ricardo Ortega will describe the work of LELO to facilitate
worker-to-worker networks globally, in order to place workers rather than
government bureaucrats and business people at the center of the project to
rewrite the rules of the global economy.</p> </p>
