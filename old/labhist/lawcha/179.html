<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Female Wobblies in Wartime</p>

<p>World War I was a tumultuous time for the Industrial Workers of the World in
the Pacific Northwest. In addition to the massive trial of Wobbly leadership in
Chicago, and the smaller but infamous cases of Louise Olivereau and Marie Equi
and Seattle and Portland, little-known Wobbly women were also at risk during
this period.</p>

<p>Female Wobblies risked arrest for simple membership in the organization during
the repressive years of the Red Scare. While the male leadership was rounded up
in raids across the country, women were arrested for supporting the
organization behind the scenes by editing and distributing the Industrial
Worker, providing support for men in jail, and working with defense
organizations to raise money for trial expenses and to support the families of
those in jail. While women’s work in jail support and defense is important,
it was typical for women to be supportive behind-the-scenes, rather than as
frontline agitators. The authorities, however, recognized this support as
essential to the Wobbly cause, and therefore women were targets of federal
surveillance as much as any of the well-known male Wobblies of the period. This
paper examines how the massive arrests affected Wobbly communities in the
Pacific Northwest and how women worked to support those in jail and risked
arrest themselves.</p>

<p>□  Finnishing the History of the 1910s Pacific Northwest Lumber Wars
This paper will provide a brief overview of the key events and themes of the
1910s labor upsurge in lumber, easily the Pacific Northwest’s largest
industry. It will focus special attention on the central place of Finnish
immigrant men and women in the making of the great 1917 Lumber Strike, the
post-strike efforts to maintain the Northwest Industrial Workers of the World
(IWW, or Wobbly) movement, and the violent repression experienced by strikers
and their supporters. In so doing, I will be exploring the internal politics of
the IWW lumber workers’ movement, looking at how identities of race, gender,
ethnicity, and politics were negotiated by the radical group, and how those
negotiations shaped the boundaries of union, socialist, and Wobbly movements in
the Pacific Northwest. It concludes that the 1917 strike and subsequent IWW
struggles were the product of years of previous labor and left-wing organizing,
which, in several Northwest lumber towns communities, was based among Finnish
immigrants.</p>

<p>A close examination of Finnish workers’ activism during the Pacific Northwest
labor conflicts yields richer and more accurate understandings of labor
relations in the Northwest’s biggest industry during the early twentieth
century. Additionally, emphasizing the place of women Finnish radicals will
help restore Finnish-American working people to the center of Pacific Northwest
labor and women’s history.</p>

<p>□  Civil Liberties and Anticolonialism in a Time of War: The National Labor
Defense Council, 1917-18 
Founded by labor lawyer Frank P. Walsh shortly after the US entry into World
War I, the National Labor Defense Council (NLDC) has been all but forgotten.
Avoided by most pro-war progressives and ridiculed by AFL president Samuel
Gompers, the poorly-funded NLDC proved even less effective in defending antiwar
activists than Roger Baldwin’s National Civil Liberties Bureau (forerunner of
the ACLU). Nonetheless, as my paper will show, the links that the NLDC forged
between antiwar labor radicals and anticolonial activists (especially those
working within America’s small South Asian population)—along with Walsh’s
own experiences defending such activists—paved the way for a vibrant post-war
anticolonial coalition, exemplified by the founding of the broadly-based League
of Oppressed Peoples in 1919 and the emergence of the Farmer-Labor political
upsurge of 1920.  </p>

<p>Drawing heavily on the voluminous Frank P. Walsh collection in the New York
Public Library, my paper provides an elaboration of themes that I discuss in my
forthcoming essay, “The Easter Rising and New York’s Anticolonial
Nationalists,” in Ireland’s Allies: America and the 1916 Easter Rising, ed.
