<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Interwoven Identities: Gender, Caste and Community in Mill Work in
Colonial Madras
This paper is about the processes of integration of women into the workforce of
the cotton textile industry in colonial Madras. It examines the social
perspectives and cultural framework that shaped life and work for the woman
worker. Women played an active, though under-appreciated, role in unionization,
lightning strikes and drawing workers into the freedom movement. Women waged
workplace battles to challenge patriarchal attempts to subordinate them and
helped frame legislative interventions and bring subaltern questions to the
nationalist discourse. 
Life at the mill, influenced by ideas of equality of gender, common citizenship
and contract but constrained by colonial subservience to authority, produced a
caricatured modernity that strained against its conservative moorings in caste,
community and gender. We trace the construction of notions of gender, community
and class among the cotton mill labourers, and their interconnections. We
examine perceptions of the state and its institutions, the unions and their
practices.</p>

<p>□  The Watsonville Canning Strike, 1985-87
Thirty years ago, Watsonville California was the site of a successful 18 month
strike by 1,000 frozen food workers, most of them Mexican immigrant women. They
fought off an attempt to decertify their union, forced the plant owner into
foreclosure, and settled with the new owner after a five-day wildcat. Besides
revitalizing what had been a virtually moribund Teamster local, the strike was
a serious bid for political power by Watsonville's emerging Mexican majority.</p>

<p>□  Rethinking Precarious Work and Care through Janitorial Workers’ Struggle</p>

<p>in South Korea
Neoliberal restructuring after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis in South Korea
produced a sharp division between regular and contingent workers, creating a
new legal category of worker pijŏnggyujik. Examining female janitorial
workers’ struggle in the context of the new precarious class formation, this
paper discusses the deepening gap between those who perform unpaid care work
and those who are perceived as valuable subjects of care in the neoliberal
labor regime. Weaving the narratives of female janitorial workers who perform
various forms of unpaid domestic care work for their young and old family
members, this paper delineates changing boundaries between the public and the
private spheres. It reveals how aging female bodies are situated in the chain
between the paid labor and the role of a caretaker at home, and how they
contribute to the crisis-driven economy through double surplus value creation
in both realms. In doing so, I argue that the new precarity is instituted and
acted upon the vulnerable bodies through the old forms of regionally specific
patriarchal and capitalist social relations.</p> </p>
