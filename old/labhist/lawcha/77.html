<h4>Bridging Mexico and Seattle: History of Seattle's Ship Scalers Union Mural</h4>

<em>Gigi Peterson</em><br>
State University of NY at Cortland

<p>

<hr>


<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Painted in 1945 by US-born Pablo O'Higgins for Seattle's Ship Scalers Union,
"The Struggle Against Racial Discrimination" hangs in the University of
Washington's Kane Hall and is a powerful depiction of labor solidarity across
borders. Along with a visual tour of this mural, the author will explore its
history, which crosses borders and decades.  Created  in a context of
Mexican-US labor and leftwing ties, the mural "disappeared" for some years, and
activists who linked it to Chicano struggles pressed the University of
Washington for its recovery.</p>

<p><em><em></em>NOT FOR SESSION PUBLICITY</em></p>

<p>I would like to propose this session as a kind of tour rather than regular
paper presentations. With LAWCHA meeting in Seattle, it seems a perfect
opportunity to reprise some elements of a talk I gave in 2012: “Bridging
Seattle and Mexico: The Journey of the Pablo O'Higgins Mural for the Seattle
Ship Scalers Union,” Public lecture for Harry Bridges Center for Labor
Studies, University of Washington - Seattle, March 2012.</p>
