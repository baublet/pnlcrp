<h4>“Our sweat and our blood have fallen on this land to make other men rich”: Narrative, Context and the Articulation of Workers’ Dreams in El Plan de Delano</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>“To those who oppose us, be they ranchers, police, politicians, or
speculators, we say that we are going to continue fighting until we die, or we
win.” </p>

<p>What were the ideological foundations of the Plan of Delano, drafted in 1966 by
Cesar Chavez and Luis Valdez? How did Emiliano Zapata’s agrarian dreams,
defined in 1911 in the Plan of Ayala, serve as a guide in the crafting of El
Plan de Delano? In his commentary to the Plan, Valdez wrote: “It was decided
by all involved that a statement of some kind was in order.” In tailoring
Zapata’s ambitious “oratory” to the needs of Californias “humble”
campesinos, Valdez described the adaptation of a revolutionary document with
the goal of setting social justice ideals and demands down in words. 
Essentially serving as a human rights document, the Plan’s character was
defined by a non-violent approach to redress the social suffering of farm
workers in search of a broad coalition of support. Was the document subversive
in its context or necessary for the rebalancing of labour asymmetries defined
by racial oppression?</p> </p>
