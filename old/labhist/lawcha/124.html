<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>On August 13, 2016, Milwaukee, Wisconsin joined Ferguson, Baltimore, and other
American cities in a new wave of racial unrest. Following yet another violent
black death at the hands of the police, the "Sherman Park Uprising" saw
confrontations between law enforcement and disaffected residents, particularly
black youth, last well into the night. As businesses burned and arrests
mounted, city leaders organized an impromptu news conference to publicly sort
out what transpired in the northwest side neighborhood. Mayor Tom Barrett and
Common Council President Ashanti Hamilton updated reporters first, detailing
the city’s efforts to restore order and admonishing parents to get a hold of
their recalcitrant teens. Their comments reflected the conventional wisdom that
unrest in predominantly black urban spaces derives from community shortcomings
and the prevailing crisis in police-community relations. This view has largely
shaped civic responses to the Sherman Park Uprising and has helped justify a
recent "Public Safety Plan" that proposes to dramatically increase Milwaukee's
police force, administer longer prison sentences, and establish "boot camps"
for "at-risk" youth among other measures.</p>

<p>Conversely, Alderpersons Khalif Rainey and Russell Stamper II offered a
powerful alternative narrative: the Sherman Park Uprising reflects a "powder
keg" of inequities and injustices that Black Milwaukeeans disproportionately
experience daily, including alarming rates of unemployment, mass incarceration,
and under-education. "The black people of Milwaukee … are tired of living
under this oppression," Rainey explained, calling for the city's racial
problems to "not [be] examined, but rectified... immediately." </p>

<p>By suggesting that the unrest is rooted in racial and economic problems, beyond
(but including) the scope of policing, Rainey, Stamper, and local community
activists identified the "Milwaukee Uprising" as part of a larger struggle
against capitalism's uneven landscapes of power and privilege---a process that
largely tracks congruent lines of race and class in American cities. In this
view, the "crisis of policing" is not in how the police "get along" with
communities, but in the legitimacy of the police institution itself and its
ability to meet a growing list of vital community needs and demands. This
roundtable aims to square these countervailing narratives, unspooling and
analyzing different threads of Milwaukee's "Sherman Park Uprising" specifically
and the role of policing and surveillance in American society more broadly; it
does so from a range of inter-related perspectives.</p> </p>
