<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  The Rise and Fall of Union Cooperatives
Labor unions’ fluctuating engagement with co-ops stands out as one of the
bigger mysteries of both organized labor and cooperative economics. Why did a
business form that once so appealed to unions lose its attract for them, to the
point that today connections between organized labor and co-ops are few and far
between? This is the central question I will explore in this paper.</p>

<p>□  The Tragedy of the 1971 IRA: British Labour Relations and Modern
Conservatism
The 1971 industrial relations Act was the most contentious piece of UK labour
law in history. It caused considerable industrial unrest in Britain during the
less than two years of its operation and was repealed by the Wilson Labour
government in 1974. However, the 1971 IRA was the first genuine attempt at
comprehensive modern labour reform in Britain, this paper seeks to
contextualise it with Britain changing political landscape of the 1970s and
wider European events at the same time.</p>

<p>□  Men &amp; Machines: Labor, Business, &amp; the State's Approach to Automation,
Productivity, Collective Bargaining, &amp; Jurisdictional Disputes at West Coast
Ports, 1957-1974
My paper will examine how transportation workers in Southern California in the
1960s and 1970s both contested and eventually accommodated significant
developments in labor saving technology, regulatory reform, and industry
practices in longshoring, short haul trucking, and warehousing. Far from a
benign march of progress centered on market efficiencies, productivity gains,
and whiggish sense of inevitability, the very terms for port modernization and
its interrelated goods handling infrastructure served as a site of struggle
between business and labor. The outcome of these transformations somewhat
paradoxically contained the ILWU’s militancy and capacity to the docks while
it simultaneously facilitated the dispersal of drayage and warehouse
infrastructure and work to the urban fringe in Southern California’s Inland
Empire. This process of geographic reorganization of regional transportation
infrastructure, then, coupled with competitive pressures and volatility in the
trucking and warehouse sectors from significant regulatory reform, eroded the
Teamsters’ organizational strength and ability to exert some measure of
control over the working conditions and hiring practices in short haul trucking
and warehouse work. While ports and warehouses may at first seem only
tangentially related, I will argue that they are symbiotic parts of a complex
regional whole that plays an important part in facilitating the global movement
of goods, and serve as an important site of struggle for transportation
workers.</p>

<p>This is not to say that Southern California is exceptional, rather as
transportation hubs across the United States, indeed the world, modernized to
accommodate the shipping container, adapted to a highly competitive deregulated
environment, and adapted business practices to exploit gaps in employment
classification and labor law, these developments reshaped the global movement
of goods. Since these transformations hold enormous implications for most
productive sectors, this also broadly holds significance for where work is
done, by whom, and under what conditions. This allows firms to benefit from not
only significantly reduced time and cost of transporting goods, but allowed for
more precision, predictability, and the ability to forecast and project needs
in logistics and distribution. And though these connections are far from
readily apparent and are further obscured by the disaggregated nature of
production characteristic of postwar business practices, my study will detail
how transportation workers in Southern California contested these larger
processes, and struggled to retain a measure of control over geographically
fragmented work, and how workers contested, and then adapted to work in these
new conditions.</p> </p>
