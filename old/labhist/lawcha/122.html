<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In universities around the world, more and more of the teaching that students
receive is delivered by postgraduate and postdoctoral academics on part-time,
fixed-term or casual contracts. This layer of precarious academic workers
continues to grow even as students are hit with higher fees, and as
universities invest in ever larger building programmes aimed at attracting more
“customers.” Academic workers on part-time, fixed-term and casual contracts
are faced with a choice: accept the erosion of their wages and conditions, or
organise to resist and maybe even reverse that trend. </p>

<p>We propose a roundtable discussion that will address this problem, and the
steps that have been taken and the steps that we might yet take to resolve it.
Because casualization and precarious labour is a global process, we want this
roundtable to compare the situation of precarious academic workers in the US
and UK and to talk about the movements that have (or have not yet) sprang up in
both countries to represent, defend and advance their cause. It will feature
two early-career academics based in the United Kingdom, Lorenzo Costaguta and
Steven Parfitt, who have begun to get involved in the organisation of academic
workers at the University of Nottingham, alongside two panellists (to be
decided and agreed on) from the LAWCHA Contingent Faculty Committee.</p> </p>
