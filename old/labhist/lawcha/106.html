<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>“Forgetting Fascism in the 1940s:  Class, Political Visions, and South Slavic
Americans”</p>

<p>During the 1940s, the rise of anti-Communism caused the narrowing of political
imaginations in the United States that, among other outcomes, rendered South
Slavic American radicalism incomprehensible to most of the larger public. Our
panel seeks to recover the dynamism of that radicalism, which most South Slavic
Americans referred to as antifascism, by explaining why we forgot about it. Too
often scholars of the 1930s and 1940s present antifascism as an epiphenomenon
of Communist activism. But for South Slavic Americans antifascism became their
politics as it linked their homelands to their host land. Throughout the
Depression years being an antifascist meant championing immigrant and African
American rights, industrial democracy, and supporting leftists abroad. By 1943,
Yugoslav Communist Guerrilla leader Josip Broz Tito epitomized the Allied
struggle against the Axis forces as his polyglot Partisan army repeatedly won
skirmishes with the Nazis.  Conservative South Slavs, whether recent arrivals
from Croatia who had supported the fascists, aliens and ethnics who lamented
the fall of the Yugoslav monarchy, or those who long cherished Catholic
anti-Communism used the growing anti-Communist mood to claim their own
Americanness and vilify their rivals within their communities. Instead of
viewing leftist South Slav efforts as an attempt to, in activist Louis
Adamic’s word, “operationalize” Franklin Roosevelt’s four freedoms, the
larger American public considered them foreign agents carrying out a Soviet
agenda.
        These papers proposed by Rachel Batch, Robert Zecker, and John Enyeart
reveal a clearer view of how antifascism functioned, and how internal ethnic
conflicts forged anticommunism.  From Herbert Gutman to Lizabeth Cohen and
Michael Denning we have been instructed that immigrants made and remade the
working class and American identity.  But sometimes waves of immigrants joined
with their fellow ethnics to obscure the legacies of their political rivals and
undermine their social democratic contributions.  For conservative South Slavs
forgetting fascism was a project aimed at destroying both the politics of their
leftist countrymen and denying their identities. Batch and Enyeart both use the
well publicized trial of Croatian Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac as one example
of the anticommunists’ project to forget fascism. Stepinac supported the
Croatian fascist regime that took power after Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia.
After the war, Tito arrested Stepinac as a war criminal and American Catholics
presented this as a clear case of Communist amorality. <br />
Zecker and
Batch
further advance this point by illustrating how anti-Tito Croatian immigrants,
who likely had fascist affiliations during the war, succeeded in Americanizing
by presenting Tito’s Yugoslavia within established tropes of Communist
totalitarianism.</p> </p>
