<h4>A Worker Writes History?</h4>

<em>Robert Rossi</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have been working on a social history of Colorado coal miners in the 1920s
and an account of the 1927-28 Colorado miners' strike since 1982. I am not an
academic and I do not have academic experience; I have done my research and
writing as a union organizer and left activist, a worker and as someone whose 
family members and friends worked in the mines. Most of my research has been
done with Colorado miners and their families and most of these people are now
deceased. Certain questions have arisen from my research: can the assembly
forms of workers' organizations be made relevant today? how do we understand
and work with the pivotal people and institutions which make workers' mass
movements possible? how do we understand the connections and lack of
connections between workers' (sub)cultures, work communities and communities
and our ability and willingness to act? How do workers live between dramatic
moments of heightened class struggle? These questions have arisen from my study
of Colorado miners in the 1920s, and I think that I am finding answers. More
broadly, other questions have arisen as well as I have done my work: can an
"ordinary" worker write working-class history? what do union activists get out
of labor and working-class history? why do we do working-class history and how
do we communicate the "why" of this to other workers? Does Brecht's poem "A
Worker Reads History" have meaning today? NOTE: I'M GOOD WITH BEING PART OF A
PANEL OR TALKING ABOUT THIS IN ANY FORMAT.</p> </p>
