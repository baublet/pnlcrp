<h4>Unions & Social Media</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Recent shifts in socioeconomic discourse have been widely perceived as opening
up potential opportunities in a widespread union renewal effort. Given the
digital media expansion that has run concurrent with labour’s decline, it
seems clear that any potential shift toward a more dynamic and influential
union movement will not only require significant social and ideological
changes, but an active role on the part of labour activists and academics in
the understanding and use of social media. This presentation will provide an
overview of the academic research that has been done on unions’ use of social
media and will highlight the challenges faced by the labour movement in
utilizing social media as a means of expanding their profile and perceived
significance to those sectors that could benefit from a larger role for labour.
Finally, this presentation will explore potential lessons for the labour
movement that can be drawn from research on social movements’ use of social
media.</p> </p>
