<h4>Workers’ Struggles on Stage: Australian Radical Theatre</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This paper considers connections within international left cultural activity by
introducing the New Theatre in Australia, which has seen very little academic
attention. Taking inspiration from the New Theatre of the USA and the Unity
Theatre in the UK, the New Theatre employed a novel mix of conventional theatre
forms, experimental performative styles and communist theories of ‘art as a
weapon’ in their presentation of left-wing theatre within a society that was
largely resistant to their broader political ideals. Their work and
organisation were avowedly working class, and support from the Communist Party
of Australia and left-wing unions was vital. Drawing from primary research and
oral history interviews, the paper highlights their struggle for industrial
justice in a marriage of culture and union activism in Australia. To illustrate
this intersection, a 1952 performance of The Candy Store, written by an
American activist, Bernard Rubin, is discussed. What makes the performance of
this play notable is the location and audience: 1500 feet down a mineshaft to
coal miners staging a stay-in strike.</p> </p>
