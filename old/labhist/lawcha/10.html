<h4>"There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This": Representation and Consciousness of Labor and the Working Class in American Musical Theatre, 1945-1975</h4>

<em>Eric Kaufman</em><br>
The Ohio State University

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>As a relatively elite stage form, “proletarianized” through development of
wide-release film versions, musical theatre occupies an odd space in the
spectrum of artistic production, straddling the boundary between “high art”
and “popular art.” Workers are sometimes colorful background or fetishized,
exoticized and sentimentalized objects of bourgeois gaze; in other instances,
they are more authentic reflections of working-class values. Popular forms of
music, dance, fashion and language, often with working-class roots, have been
integral to musical theatre form and structure. Being both a product of and a
producer of popular culture, musical theatre offers a window into the role of
working-class representations and culture in the broader artistic, commercial
and political culture of our society. </p>

<p>If the images, sounds, forms and values of workers are to be represented in
art, whether as specifically working-class expressions or as appropriation for
a dominant-class audience, workers have a right of ownership to those
representations and an interest—a class interest—in attempting to interpret
and understand them. That understanding is dependent upon an aggressive
insistence that artistic works that depict working people answer to a
working-class critique.</p> </p>
