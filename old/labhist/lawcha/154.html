<h4>War Workers: Pacific Islanders and the U.S. Military in World War Two</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Today, more than 70,000 so-called “third-party nationals” from places as far apart as India, Kenya, and Fiji are working for the U.S. military in war zones such as Afghanistan and Iraq. In my presentation, I will explore the longer history of non-citizen civilian laborers doing the dirty work for the U.S. military. A significant group of workers since the Civil War, the number of non-citizen civilian workers for the U.S. military expanded and diversified dramatically during World War Two. Over 2,000 Hawaiians served in the U.S. Army in both Pacific and European theaters. In the Pacific, American Samoans helped U.S. Marines build an airstrip, extend the naval base, and fortify roads and docks. Solomon Islanders assisted U.S. soldiers as construction workers, local scouts, and messengers. One of them, the Solomon Islander Jacob Vouza, even rescued a young John F. Kennedy from a Japanese ambush. Overall, I argue that these Pacific war workers played a crucial role in the ultimate U.S. success in the Pacific war. Faced with pervasive racism and demeaning work conditions, Pacific Islanders managed to create new opportunities both for themselves and for their home societies. </p>
