<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In What Michael Denning identifies as the beginning of the “era of the
CIO,” roughly 1935 to 1955, the United States experienced the high water mark
of governmental support for the arts. Notwithstanding LBJ’s Great Society, an
extension of many New Deal inspired programs, the 1930s stand out for their
cultural democracy, art of, by, and for the people. Of course, public history
itself is another kind of democratic investment in the arts. In this panel,
Patricia Raynor form the US Postal Museum will discuss and examine New Deal
murals in the Pacific Northwest as public art aimed at putting artists to work
but also for the purposes of making art available to all citizens, not just
wealthy patrons in the cities. Conor Casey will discuss his role as the labor
archivist for the University of Washington and recently digitized collections
featuring arts and labor, especially the work of Richard V. (Dick) Correll
(1904–1990) who was “one of the leading masters of printmaking in the
West.” Digitizing makes these resources available to all. Kate
Sampsell-Willmann will mine the archives at the Library of Congress Farm
Security Administration photographs for a images that show “The Long Arm of
the Job,” where less iconic but just as compelling images can reveal about
work as a social value untethered from labor for wages.</p> </p>
