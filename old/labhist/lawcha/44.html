<h4>Labor and Digital Media: Organizing the "Creative City"</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the Spring of 2015, writers for the news and gossip website Gawker announced
their intention to organize with the Writers’ Guild of America East (WGAE). 
Gawker’s management recognized the union without any resistance. Soon
thereafter writers at other digital outlets, from Vice Media to Salon to The
Huffington Post, sought and gained union recognition, some joining up with
WGAE, others with the NewsGuild, and most through a routine card check. 
Observers saw in this burst of organizing an important sign of life for
organized labor, not least because it involved a demographic thought to be
immune to the attractions of trade unionism.</p>

<p>This paper takes a step back.  First, I map this burst of organizing onto the
transformation of the political economy of the news media. Then I examine the
history of unionization in the cultural industry and in journalism to draw out
the themes—such as the running tension between the romance of the writer’s
life and the need for economic security, between an accommodating
professionalism and a more oppositional trade unionism—that might best inform
an understanding of the present situation.  Finally, I will shift the
perspective a bit.  Since many of these workers are indeed young and
college-educated, those “creative class” types that thanks to Richard
Florida have fired the early 21st century urbanist imagination, does
unionization in their ranks represent a new scale of struggle in the
neo-liberal city?  And how might it fit in with current efforts to re-think
organized labor more generally?</p> </p>
