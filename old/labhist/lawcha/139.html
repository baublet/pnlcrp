<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>It has been nearly thirty years since a pioneer in the study of international
political economy, Robert Cox, published his book, Production, Power and World
Order. Within, he assessed the “reciprocal relationship between power and
production” based upon the organization of world labor forces, noting the
political and economic “consequences of output.” Setting his study in an
historical frame, Cox drew inferences from the International Labor Organization
(ILO) where he had worked twenty-five years. </p>

<p>In a comparable way, this panel seeks to analyze the ILO via a set of
provocative new questions concerning the dynamics of global production networks
since the 1980s. What has happened within the international labor standards
regime due to the transitions in power and leverage between labor unions, other
movements in support of workers’ rights, and the “state” in various
locales? What has been the influence of trends assessing labor value within
global supply chains (“value chains”), including the value of female labor
in relation to male, of workers in former colonial regions versus former
metropoles, between racial minorities and majorities, or via the employment of
migrants compared to citizens? <br />
Finally,
based
upon the
explosive
rise of
power
in the form of the multinational corporation, what has been the effect on the
current international labor standards regime? </p>

<p>India and Indonesia posed two of the earliest postwar challenges for a newly
retooled International Labor Organization following WWII. How would a global
organization advocate for workers while simultaneously supporting bids for
economic sovereignty in leading postcolonial states? Drawing on sources from
official archives in Geneva, New Delhi, and Jakarta, B.K. Williams’ paper
interrogates the ILO’s relationship with India and Indonesia after each state
achieved independence. It argues that the ILO cooperated with local governments
to foster a political economy that produced a workforce that emerged as the
vanguard of globalization. By boosting the fortunes of workers in the Global
South, ironically, the ILO undermined the foundation of the United States’
Fordist economic order. How can historians explain the roots of income
inequality and structural challenges facing American workers? The answer can be
traced to the corridors of the ILO’s headquarters in Geneva and its field
offices in New Delhi and Jakarta. </p>

<p>The notion of worldwide development, involving an articulation of knowledge and
mobilization of power, was set in motion in the late 1950s and perfected in the
decades that followed. As part of the UN Development Decade, the ILO sought to
anchor development with basic human needs, also offering attention to
workers’ human rights. Yet how did ILO ambitions stand up to the “economics
of production” and heightened intensity of global economic expansion amid the
global division of labor, by gender and geography? Developing nations were
pressured to allow industrially advanced ones to help in the “modernization
of the structures,” including the structures of production for profit.  Thus,
Jill Jensen’s paper looks at the ILO in the 1960s and 70s and the conflict
over productivity and growth, on one hand, and “rights” and human worth on
the other. Within, the ILO’s World Employment Program came into conflict with
the rising US multinational enterprise.</p> </p>
