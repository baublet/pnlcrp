<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This session is a roundtable loosely based around Civic Labors: Scholar
Activism and Working-Class Studies (Illinois, October 2016). Chaired by one of
the book's editors, the session will feature a variety of scholar activists
engaging the audience in a discussion of the opportunities and challenges of
scholarly work focused on facilitating social change in coordination with
non-academic partners. Participants will consider the role of various power
relationships--particularly race and gender--in shaping the success of such
work. Specific examples of topics include the Iowa Labor History Oral Project,
a forty-year-old oral history project co-directed and financed by scholars,
archivists, and the Iowa AFL-CIO; the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, a
collaborative effort at building labor-academic alliances founded in a
relationship between the ILWU and the University of Washington; and the Regina
V. Polk Women's Labor Leadership Conference, an ongoing, university based
program for empowering women labor leaders named for a pioneering woman in the
IBT.</p> </p>
