<h4>Forging an Immigrant Workers’ Movement in the Shadows of Border Militarization, State Anti-Unionism, and the Neoliberal Non-Profit Industrial Complex</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The U.S.-Mexico border along the 100-mile stretch of South Texas land known as the Rio Grande Valley carries with it some of the most unique and perilous conditions for laborers in the country.  What this region has historically struggled with in regards to labor rights is a confluence of factors ranging from geographic isolation to high immigrant populations to Texas’ longstanding anti-union history among others.  More recently, however, the level of militarization in this border region has escalated to the highest point since the early 20th century efforts against Mexican sediciosos, anti-American, Mexican dissidents, in which the National Guard was introduced into the region in order to maintain social control.  In 2014, the National Guard was again summoned, but far from the days of the sediciosos, these armed military members were mostly patrolling a group of people working and living in perhaps the worst conditions in America without the crimes rates to justify this extra oversight.  To make matters worse, those who are currently fighting against the labor injustices of yesterday situated in the border military zone of today, are also having to deal with the convoluted world of what many have termed “the non-profit industrial complex.”  The border militarization handicaps potential worker organizing efforts as many fear retribution via deportation against themselves or family members if they speak up and the non-profit industrial complex makes it difficult for grassroots efforts to succeed as the more heavily funded efforts always seem to be those that least challenge the status quo and in essence least push the envelope for worker rights.  Yet in spite of all this and in spite of the popular anti-union sentiment that has long plagued the state of Texas, a budding workers center has emerged in South Texas known as Fuerza Del Valle Workers Center which, using other worker center models, is creating possibilities for worker liberation in this politically arid terrain.
<p>
Fuerza del Valle is a grassroots workers center which provides support to workers in the area in cases of wage theft through grassroots methods of protest and public shaming while utilizing its attachment to the lawyers of the South Texas Civil Rights Project to leverage power against those who underpay and/or grossly mistreat South Texas workers in the form of litigation.        Fuerza is small in that it employs only two staff members, but is huge in that it has an active membership upwards of thirty to forty workers who have either won claims against former employers through Fuerza or simply choose to proactively support a worker-based organization knowing that their time of need could come at any moment in this context of precarious employment on the border.  Included in this group of workers is a sub-committee of female domestic workers who attempt to find solutions collaboratively to the problems that they face in their jobs which are notorious for mistreatment and abuse.  As well, Fuerza regularly organizes marches, information sessions and other events in support of immigrant rights considering that the vast majority of workers involved with Fuerza are immigrants.        The point of this presentation is to detail how grassroots labor organizing in a place like the South Texas border is taking place in order to provide insight into the present and future of this work in immigrant, anti-union, and/or militarized, border communities in the age of neoliberalism.        It is through dialogue with one another while being situated in different contexts that we believe we can build the best opportunities for the advancement of worker rights and organizing efforts in spite of the complex manner in which labor efforts are daily attacked. </p>
