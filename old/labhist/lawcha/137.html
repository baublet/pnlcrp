<h4>Socialism Before Sanders: Channeling “A Mighty River”</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the second half of the 1930s onward, socialists made the transition from
independent political action under the banner of the Socialist Party of America
(SP) to an embrace of the Democratic Party as an electoral vehicle. Their
utopian aspirations faded, and they embraced social democracy, or what one
commentator called “mature” socialism. Socialists no longer insisted there
was a “correct” road to socialism. They recognized that capitalism was a
malleable economic structure that could be made responsive to the demands of
working people. The movement of socialists into the ranks of the Democratic
Party confounds claims that socialism failed in the United States because
socialists were too ideological in their outlook and could not accept the
pragmatic demands required in politics. Perhaps the SP was too dogmatic, rigid,
and unwilling to accept the demands of participation in a political system that
required compromising ideals to achieve power and bring change. Ultimately,
however, American socialists proved they could compromise. They adopted a
pragmatic approach to political action and achieved some success outside of
their one-time party.</p> </p>
