<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Rural spaces in the United States of America have been inextricably bound up
with advanced Capitalism since at least the mid-nineteenth century, when
distant commodity markets and capital investors began to shape the types of
crops grown and the organization of farm work and space. “Agrarian
Capitalism,” as geographer Richard Walker names it, was firmly entrenched by
the twentieth century, and it only grew stronger as agricultural producers and
the United States Department of Agriculture worked to make “every farm a
factory” (Richard Walker 2004; Deborah Fitzgerald 2003). However, in the
mid-twentieth century, rural workers and communities increasingly confronted
capitalisms that were not “agrarian.” These Capitalisms did not so much
shape rural space as dissolve it, and they drew the rural working class into a
global capitalist space in new and deeper ways.</p>

<p>Our panel examines the rural working class’s response to developments in
Industrial, Financial, and Post-Industrial Capitalism from the 1940s to 1990s.
How were these changes different from changes that preceded them? What were the
consequences for rural workers and communities? How did rural workers and their
advocates make sense of these changes, and what did they do to resist or take
advantage of them? Our panel engages this year’s conference theme of
“Scales of Struggle” by examining the way rural workers and rural spaces
suffered, resisted, and embraced bigger, broader Capitalist transformations
around them.</p> </p>
