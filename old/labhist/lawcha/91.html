<h4>A Great Vision: An Activist Family’s History in the Fight for Social Justice</h4>

<em>Richard March</em><br>
Independent Folklorist

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Personal accounts by people who have directly experienced historical events can
provide vivid and empathetic insights into history. Typically such accounts in
the form of memoirs encompass the life span of one individual.
Multi-generational family histories that comprise multiple voices are very
rare. This presentation synopsizes one such work, my recently-released book
“A Great Vision” published by Hardball Press. 
There is the rich oral tradition of my family’s narrative, of our Old World
struggles as Croatian nationalists resisting nascent Italian fascism in the
turbulent northern Adriatic region, our immigration story and arrival in
industrial Chicago. A vivid picture of life in the midst of 1930s organizing
efforts emerges out of the extensive excerpts from oral history interviews with
my father Herb March, a key organizer of Chicago’s packinghouse workers, and
personal experience stories from my mother Jane March, an initiator of the
Back-of-the-Yards Neighborhood Council. 
The tragic story of the fates of my three uncles who, in the depths of the
Great Depression, after a decade in the USA, returned to Europe to join an
American-founded commune in the Soviet Union provides a glimpse into the
little-studied phenomenon of migration of Americans to the USSR.
How family values of struggle were conveyed to ensuing generations is revealed
in the account of my own participation in the civil rights, peace, and student
New Left movements in Los Angeles, Berkeley and Mississippi, and of my niece
Sara’s principled stand as a tree-sitting environmental activist in northern
California. 
The family story is useful to historians and imbued with relevant issues such
as trans-nationalism and gender dynamics.</p> </p>
