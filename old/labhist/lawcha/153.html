<h4>Rethinking Precarious Work and Care through Janitorial Workers’ Struggle in South Korea</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Neoliberal restructuring after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis in South Korea
produced a sharp division between regular and contingent workers, creating a
new legal category of worker pijŏnggyujik. Examining female janitorial
workers’ struggle in the context of the new precarious class formation, this
paper discusses the deepening gap between those who perform unpaid care work
and those who are perceived as valuable subjects of care in the neoliberal
labor regime. Weaving the narratives of female janitorial workers who perform
various forms of unpaid domestic care work for their young and old family
members, this paper delineates changing boundaries between the public and the
private spheres. It reveals how aging female bodies are situated in the chain
between the paid labor and the role of a caretaker at home, and how they
contribute to the crisis-driven economy through double surplus value creation
in both realms. In doing so, I argue that the new precarity is instituted and
acted upon the vulnerable bodies through the old forms of regionally specific
patriarchal and capitalist social relations.</p> </p>
