<h4>"The Quiet Revolution": The Transformation of Home Health Care in Oregon (documentary film)</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Working in collaboration with SEIU Local 503, the Labor Education and
Research Center (LERC) at the University of Oregon is producing a film
documenting the “quiet revolution” that has transformed home health care in
the state of Oregon since workers gained union representation in 2001.               </p>

<p>The
state of Oregon has been at the forefront of this transformation, earning a
national reputation for its commitment to helping physically and intellectually
disabled persons live independent and dignified lives. <br />
SEIU
Local
503
represents over 11,000 home caregivers in Oregon and has spearheaded the policy
innovations that will be examined in the film.</p>

<pre><code>    Grounded in the experiences and perspectives of workers, their clients,
</code></pre>

<p>and other stakeholders, the documentary, titled “The Quiet Revolution,”
will trace the evolution of home care organizing in Oregon and explain how
union representation has changed the lives of caregivers and the populations
they serve.  In addition to improving their conditions of employment, home care
workers have obtained new training opportunities, created higher professional
standards, and gained additional resources for their constituents.  “The
Quiet Revolution” will examine the creative strategies the union used to
organize a dispersed group of workers and underscore the broad public benefits
of adopting a collaborative approach to the delivery of health care services. 
Its message is especially timely and relevant given the rising number of people
who are likely to be served by in-home caregivers as the U. S. population ages
and life expectancies continue to rise.</p>

<pre><code>    Two members of “The Quiet Revolution’s” production team, Sonia De
</code></pre>

<p>La Cruz and Bob Bussel, will show excerpts from the film as a work in progress
and conduct an interactive workshop discussing its historical and contemporary
significance.</p> </p>
