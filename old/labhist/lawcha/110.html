<h4>“‘A Union of All Reforms’: The Industrial Congress and the Antislavery-Labor Alliance, 1845–1860”</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The relationship between the early American labor movement and abolitionism has
often been portrayed as fraught with tension and mutual animosity, a hostility
that sometimes spilled over into violence in such episodes as the
Anti-abolitionist Riots of 1834 and the Draft Riots of 1863.  Indeed, labor
reformers and abolitionists were often in conflict with one another over such
issues as economic inequality, race, and the legitimacy of wage labor in an
evolving capitalist economy. But out of the discursive debates over slavery,
labor, and political economy in the 1830s and 40s emerged, I argue, a degree of
cooperation and coalition-building between labor reformers and abolitionists
that has been largely overlooked by most of the recent literature on
antislavery as well as the newest work on “capitalism and slavery.”  Land
reformers, trade unionists, ten hours-law supporters, abolitionists and early
socialists made common cause in the pre-Civil War Industrial Congresses, held
between 1845 and 1860 and hailed by progressives of various stripes as a
“union of reformers” that would help to bring about what they referred to
as an “integral emancipation,” liberating workers from both chattel and
wage slavery. </p>

<pre><code>    While the Industrial Congresses ultimately fell far short of these
</code></pre>

<p>overly sanguine expectations, they did lead to an unprecedented gathering
together of the representatives of various reforms, as well as to a tentative
but transformative political alliance between working-class land reformers
affiliated with the National Reform Association and the antislavery Liberty
Party. In keeping with the theme of “Borders and Coalitions,” I propose to
examine the impact of this alliance in the context of the political
realignments bought about by the aftermath of the Mexican-American War and
Wilmot Proviso and the heightened internationalism of the revolutionary year
1848. The advent of an aggressive slaveholder expansionism and the prospect of
the loss of formerly “free soil” to slave plantations provided the catalyst
for an unprecedented degree of cooperation between antislavery and pro-labor
forces. While the alliance between labor reformers and the Liberty Party was
short-lived, it resulted in an unprecedented and perhaps never-replicated
free-labor experiment between abolitionist Gerrit Smith and landless workers,
both black and white, in New York City and State. Although the Industrial
Congresses lost much of their momentum by the early 1850s, the representatives
it gathered and the ideas they propounded ultimately contributed to the
ideological and social base of the new Republican Party. After the war, the
Industrial Congresses would be once again revived to serve as a vehicle for a
reanimated labor militancy.</p> </p>
