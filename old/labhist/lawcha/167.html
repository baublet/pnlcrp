<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Informed by the recent scholarship on transpacific history (Fujitani 2013; Lowe
2015), this panel examines allegiances across the colonial periphery of the
twentieth-century Pacific world, with a focus on the intersections between
United States and East Asian history, as well as labor history and the history
of empire. With the industrialization of the Japanese and U.S. empires at the
turn of the twentieth century, rural and urban populations experienced new,
uneven forms of expropriation, to which they responded with innovative modes of
solidarity and protest. Our papers will address the ways in which a variety of
workers responded to the violent wave of enclosures and colonialism that swept
up the populations living between the U.S and Japanese Empires.
      First, reexamining the Marxian concept, Toulouse-Antonin Roy discusses
how the process of “primitive accumulation” by the Japanese empire smashed
the indigenous populations and prevented a possible workers’ collaboration in
colonial Taiwan. Second, Hiroaki Matsusaka analyzes how Japanese proletarian
writer Maedakō Hiroichirō, a former migrant worker in the U.S., described
race and gender relations of transpacific migrant workers in a ship headed from
Yokohama to Seattle in the 1920s. Third, Maryam Aziz examines the labor of
Black soldiers, veterans, and activists who were stationed in the Pacific or
practiced East Asian martial arts between World War II and the Vietnam War. As
such, we will attempt to clarify the “scales of struggles” in the Pacific
world, exploring the diversity of working-class responses to imperial
domination and capitalist accumulation.</p> </p>
