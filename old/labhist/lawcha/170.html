<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>A lecture-demonstration on an oral history theater project and its role in a
successful union contract campaign. Developed over a two-year period, "Janitors
on Stage" brought together the Labor and Community Studies Department of City
College of San Francisco, SEIU Local 87 and the Labor Archives and Research
Center at San Francisco State. Presenters will describe the project, involve
attendees in a read-along of the performance material and analyze the part
played by the performance in the union's successful contract campaign. They
will conclude by leading attendees in a discussion of the intersection of
worker activism, public history and art.</p>

<p>Labor and Community Studies' (LBCS) "Work Tales" oral history theater program
brings workers together to explore key issues of concern in their lives and in
their unions or workers' centers. The Labor Archives trains participants in how
to conduct worker-worker oral history interviews, which they then store. LBCS
staff work with the participants to hone their material into a performance
piece of interwoven monologues, songs and choreography. This material is then
performed for union members and the broader community.</p>

<p>In the "Janitors on Stage" iteration of this collaborative model, the partners
built on the long-standing educational relationship between LBCS and Local 87.
Brought in to help the union in 2015 with strategic planning for its 2016
city-wide contract campaign, LBCS staff proposed to use its oral history
theater template as part of the union's visibility outreach. Local 87's largely
Latino, Chinese and Yemeni membership clean the city's skyscraper offices after
everyone else has gone home for the night. Often unseen by the city, these
workers found their hard-won union standard threatened by the greed of some of
San Francisco's most recognized new high-tech companies. </p>

<p>In the culminatilon of their hard-fought campaign, Local 87's members found
themselves onstage performing in four languages one week, marching through
downtown office atria the next and reaching a deal with their employers the
week after that. The workshop will describe and analyze each step of this
ultimately successful collaboration.</p> </p>
