<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Dramatizing the conference sub-theme "Struggling for Justice," this workshop
will recount a crucial fight for gender justice in the Pacific Northwest that
successfully built solidarity across lines of race, sexuality, and job status.
The organizing effort connected labor and community movements, and drew on this
dynamic to implement affirmative action and advance union support for women and
people of color in the trades. </p>

<p>In 1974, ten women entered the electrical utility trades at Seattle City Light
through a unique Electrical Trades Trainee (ETT) program designed by a
well-known local socialist feminist leader, Clara Fraser. The aspiring
tradeswomen – Black, white, Chicana and Asian American – joined the largely
white, male workforce at a moment of high employee morale following a
victorious 10-day walkout. But they soon encountered a utility-wide culture of
sexism, racism and anti-labor practices that was entrenched at the highest
levels of management. The ETTs and the women who came after them fought hard to
stay in the workforce and experienced discriminatory layoffs, intense
harassment, and serious injuries. Many found that the secret to survival lay in
building alliances with men of color, white union brothers, and office staff at
the utility. Black men, who had encountered similar obstacles in their own
recent entry into the trades, were a particularly strong source of support. </p>

<p>The groundbreaking women confronted bigotry while demonstrating their common
interests with other workers. They sought to expose city management and hold
City Light accountable as a publicly owned utility. They motivated the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 77 to be more responsive
to its diverse membership. They formed an employee rights organization, the
Committee for Equal Rights at City Light (CERCL), which bridged union
boundaries and fought discrimination against all workers, both organized and
unorganized. They successfully defended and expanded the city’s and
county’s anti-discrimination laws as co-founders of a community-labor
coalition, the Ad Hoc Committee for Fair Employment and Open Housing. They
worked closely with a range of groups including the City Light Black Employees
Association (CLBEA), Seattle Employee Association of Gays and Lesbians (SEAGL),
Women in Engineering, Radical Women, Freedom Socialist Party, and the Seattle
Light Brigade, a consumer organization. </p>

<p>The workshop will feature veterans of these momentous struggles and a public
historian currently writing a book on the saga. The presenters’ knowledge and
experiences will offer inspiration and concrete lessons for today’s movements
about how to build working-class solidarity across lines of gender, race, and
sexuality. </p>

<p>Presentations will be supplemented with a PowerPoint slideshow of photos and
documents from the City Light organizing, and charts showing historical
statistics on wages in the trades, comparable worth and affirmative action, and
women’s participation in the trades.</p> </p>
