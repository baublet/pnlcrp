<h4>The Right to Know versus the Perpetuation of Ignorance, New York versus Connecticut: Policy Conflict over Workers' Access to Health Hazard Information from the Progressive Era to the New Deal (individual paper proposal, also being submitted by David Obringer as part of tentative panel proposal with his paper, still missing 3d presenter)</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Abstract: The proposed paper addresses a struggle over workers’ right to know about health hazards they faced on the job.  In the 1910s, New York set a progressive policy of providing access to hazard information such as the findings of state inspections and the reports of occupational disease cases filed by physicians.  Prior to the 1930s, Connecticut was the only state impounding that sort of evidence of hazards.  New York placed regulation of occupational health under its state labor department; Connecticut gave that authority to its state health agency.  A clause in the Social Security Act promoted development of occupational health capability in state health departments by offering funding to establish new industrial-hygiene units, shifting the scale of public-policy struggle over this matter to the national-government level.  As states pursued the federal funds and followed the Public Health Service’s guidance to emulate Connecticut, the labor movement fought back by defending the state-level labor agencies.  At the end of the 1930s, liberal Senator James Murray offered a proposal to allow state labor departments to share in the Social Security grants.  The battle over his bill brought to light the injustice of supporting health bureaucracies that refused to share life-and-death information with the workers at risk. </p>
