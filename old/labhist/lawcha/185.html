<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Strikes, Comprehensive Campaigns and the Revival of the Labor Movement
This paper troubles the assertion that reviving the strike is labor’s primary
strategy for union renewal. It beings with the understanding that unions have
been successful when they developed forms of resistance that take into account
how employers are structured and how they operate in the context of the state.
Strikes constituted a successful union tactic in the early part of the 20th
century given their ability to exert economic pressure on relatively simple
firms. By mid-century firms were becoming increasing complex, but the post-war
labor accord established a legal and political framework around the strike –
which was a regular feature of the post-war industrial relations system. With
firms increasingly taking on post-modern forms the contestation of power today
is often not on the picket line or the plant gates which raises the question if
strikes are automatically the appropriate form of resistance. Given the
complexity of 21st century firms, one cannot assume that any one tactic (such
as the strike) is appropriate without extensive corporate research to identify
how power flows in a firm and its potential vulnerabilities. The real promise
of comprehensive/strategic campaigns is the utilization of deep corporate
research to build multifaceted campaigns that draw from structural,
institutional, associational and symbol power that operate at a number of
different scales. In this way comprehensive campaigns can create new
opportunities for militancy that the strike cannot.</p>

<p>□  Creating a City to Resist the State: The Seattle General Strike of 1919
The Seattle general strike of 1919 was a remarkable moment in the process that
Eugene Holland characterizes in Nomad Citizenship as a slow-motion general
strike. The Seattle general strike rose out of the immanent historical
practices of Seattle’s labor communities as they interrupted state and
capitalist formations and instead organized to govern themselves. Defying the
conservative national leadership of their own unions as well as Seattle’s
bombastic governmental and economic elites, these workers organized themselves
into a viable alternative structure for making and carrying out decisions
necessary to running the city. The writings of the strike’s historian, Anna
Louise Strong, and of the “two-card men” whose dual union membership
combined the fight to improve existing conditions with the larger struggle for
a better world, both reflect and create a constructive dissidence that still
resonates today. The Seattle general strike ended on February 11. Yet perhaps
it did not. I suggest that Seattle’19 can still be available to us as an
example of Eugene Holland’s idea of affirmative nomadology, an opportunity to
distill principles and practices for organizing ourselves outside the confines
of capital and the state. Holland encourages us to identify assemblages of
resonating processes that serve as relays for material and political
operations. Seattle’19, I argue, is a resonating moment within Holland’s
imagining of “a long-term process of becoming-general of the general
strike.” (p. 156)</p>

<p>□  Imagining the Commonweal: Coxey's Army, Cox's March, and Working Class
Political Conceptions of the Public Sphere, 1896-1932
In 1896 Jacob Coxey, a populist reformer and small town business leader, led a
group of unemployed workers on a march to Washington D.C. Covering hundreds of
miles, and generating large amounts of newspaper coverage, Coxey and the other
marchers used the conception of the "commonweal" as a central theme in their
rhetoric to challenge popular Gilded Age ideas of the political economy. Routed
at the Capitol Building by police, the protest ended with no formal action
taken by Congress or the Cleveland administration to address public concerns of
the economy. Decades later a radical labor priest, James Renshaw Cox, led a
group of unemployed once again from Pennsylvania to D.C. Echoing many of the
ideas of Coxey and the marchers of the 1890s, Cox was part of a growing segment
of American Catholics who used the commonweal as a framework to reimagine how
the public sphere, politics, and the economy should relate. Once again the
marchers were largely ignored by the President, yet the marchers did gain the
support of Hoover's Treasury Secretary, support that would eventually lead to
political scandal and his impeachment. This paper is an examination of how
working class political movements have reimagined the public sphere,
specifically with the conception of the commonweal, and those reimaginings
were, and still are, radical critiques of capitalist political economy. In a
period where social movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter
rely on the taking of public space, making radical critiques of political
economy, and responding to hostile government responses, such a history is
critical for academic and popular understanding</p>

<p>□  The Fraternal Tradition and the Global History of the Knights of Labor
The history of international labour movements during the nineteenth century is
generally told in a certain way. Socialists, anarchists and trade unionists
from different countries came together in a variety of networks, movements and
organisations to win strikes, regulate migration, and agitate for political
change across national borders. The First and the Second Internationals were
the largest and best-known of these movements.</p>

<p>Has this narrative obscured other trends and traditions in that story? This
paper will draw on my research and work into the global history of the Knights
of Labor, and on Robert Weir’s groundbreaking work concerning the fraternal
side of the Knights, to think about whether we as historians have missed or
underplayed the importance of fraternal culture in our understanding of
international labour history. Fraternal orders were, after all, among the
largest organisations that catered to a working-class audience. The United
Order of Oddfellows, the Ancient Order of Foresters and other orders recruited
working-class members across the world and provided them with the social
insurance that states did not yet provide. Movements like the Knights of Labor
were also organised on fraternal lines, and secret, fraternal organisations
were present at the formation of the First International and other major global
movements. There is an entire tradition here that needs much greater
examination.</p>

<p>This paper has contemporary relevance as well. Many commentators have pointed
to a decline in solidarity at the workplace and in the community as both a
cause and effect of the decline in trade union membership. Fraternal culture,
with its encouragement of brotherhood (or sisterhood) through shared ritual,
once fulfilled this function. While there is very little chance of a revival of
fraternal culture right now, we should consider other ways of building
solidarity that do not rely only on economic self-interest.</p> </p>
