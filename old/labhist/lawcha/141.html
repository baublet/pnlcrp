<h4>“The Cause and Cure of Strikes”: The Promise of Postwar Social Science in Socialist Thought</h4>

<em>Matthew Mettler</em><br>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Socialist and social theorist Stuart Chase included a chapter on “The Cause
and Cure of Strikes” in his 1948 study of the state of the social sciences,
"The Proper Study of Mankind." Industrial conflict was just one of many social
problems that Chase and others hoped may soon be “solved” as the social
sciences advanced to form a science of human relations that would rival the
precision and accomplishments of the technical sciences. This paper will show
how a broad spectrum of postwar socialists and liberal reformers believed that
an objective and rational science of human relations could render the politics
of social reform moot and usher in an era of social harmony. This movement
included non-political reformers like B.F. Skinner, whose 1948 utopian novel
"Walden Two" is perhaps the most popular example of the optimism surrounding
postwar social science, but this paper will focus primarily on how such ideas
animated socialists and the labor movement. In particular, I will discuss how
this movement influenced the trade union philosophy and socialism of United
Auto Workers’ President Walter Reuther. The ideas in this paper serve as the
ideological and cultural foundation for my larger study of Walter Reuther’s
UAW and the social sciences.</p> </p>
