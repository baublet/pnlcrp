<h4>Mapping The Crisis: Du Bois and the Small Scale</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mapping The Crisis: Du Bois and the Small Scale</p>

<p>Display/Screening</p>

<p>In its early days in the nineteen-teens, the NAACP’s monthly magazine, The
Crisis, was a multimedia, polygeneric publication containing long-form
reporting, editorials, photography, fiction, poetry, and other kinds of
content. One component of W.E.B. Du Bois’ journal was a monthly column that
aggregated news clippings and accounts of smaller-scale events. Titled first
“Along the Color Line” and later “The Horizon,” the miscellany contains
events under headings ranging from “Education” to “Crime,” from “The
Ghetto” to “Social Uplift,” from “Music and Arts” to “The War.”
Most entries are tagged with a location or several locations, and the dates of
the issues tag them in time as well. </p>

<p>I propose displaying or screening (whichever applies best) a digital humanities
project that I have developed to engage with the miscellany. Developed through
a fellowship from the University of Washington’s Simpson Center for the
Humanities, and in collaboration with UW’s Mapping Social Movements website,
this project, titled “A Year on the Horizon,” took each of the hundreds of
entries per month and projected them on a map. After creating a database of
more than a thousand entries from “The Horizon,” I used mapping software to
create an interactive visualization of each month’s entries covering a year
from summer 1916 to summer 1917 (a range that will be expanded in further
drafts). </p>

<p>“A Year on the Horizon” is a micro-scale, qualitative complement to the
quantitative history of the NAACP that Mapping American Social Movements
already holds. The grand scale of the rise of the NAACP described by maps and
charts that count the rise in membership and the increase in the number of
branches provide mutual context for one year of the everyday life of the
community it represented. “The Horizon” vividly illustrates collective and
individual triumphs and tragedies. Reading the entries feels like opening a
window to another time—but the more one reads, the more it feels like a
mirror, reflecting 21st Century social justice issues. </p>

<p>In the January 1916 issue of The Crisis, Du Bois explained his process for
selecting cuttings for “The Horizon” and other sections of the paper: “To
preserve that balance of judgment and foresight on the one hand which will make
the magazine popular, and on the other hand make it a real force for education
and uplift—this is no easy task and calls for unusual ability and
clairvoyance if it is well done.” (135). He ends this editorial by reminding
his readers “remember that this is not a mere magazine—it is a magazine
with a purpose.” “A Year on the Horizon” attempts to honor the ability
and clairvoyance of Du Bois and his collaborators by making it easier to
access, read, and sort through the history contained in “The Horizon.”</p>

<p>The maps are not currently up for display, though we hope to have them go live
on Mapping Social Movements soon. If readers would like to look at a draft, I
will be happy to forward a link to them--email me at tylerbabbie@gmail.com. I
currently envision a display of the project, but if the organizers have an idea
for another means of presentation, I am happy to adjust my plans.</p> </p>
