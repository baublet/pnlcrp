<h4>“Hard Times at the Cooker:” The Struggle to Save Chicago’s Public Hospital</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>My paper explores the impact that disinvestment and privatization had on staff
and patients at Cook County Hospital during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and
the movement they formed in response. In the 1970s, Chicago’s economy, like
that of the nation’s, had collapsed while medical costs skyrocketed. Facing
pressure from the state, Cook County enacted a series of austerity policies.
Officials laid off nurses’ aides and clerical workers and reduced the number
of hospital beds. When the County contracted out the hospital’s management to
Hyatt Medical Management Enterprises, Inc. in 1980, the subsidiary of the Hyatt
Hotel Corporation sent collections agencies after patients. Deteriorating
working conditions and health care delivery moved the hospital community to
action. Medical professionals, hospital workers, and community members
mobilized their unions and formed the Committee to Save Cook County Hospital to
defend the public institution that was integral to the livelihoods and health
of many.</p> </p>
