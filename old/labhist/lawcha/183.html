    <p>□  Relationship-Based Organizing: AFSCME's Clerical Unionization Campaigns at
the University of Minnesota
By the 1970s, clerical workers in higher education increasingly reached out to
the large unions for help in bargaining, as they encountered a lack of job
security, reorganization of work, and difficult bargaining conditions due, in
part, to diminishing state funding for universities, and turned to affiliation
and unionization to strengthen the workers’ power. AFSCME, which represented
more university office workers than any other union nationally, hoped to appeal
to higher education clericals by drawing on their long experience in the public
sector and paying attention to the majority women clerical workers’
gender-specific needs. Through an examination of the University of Minnesota,
Relationship-Based Organizing: AFSCME’s Clerical Unionization Campaigns at
the University of Minnesota shows AFSCME’s tactical change in unionization
campaigns, switching from unsuccessfully focusing on campaign literature in the
1982 campaign to a highly successful person-to-person organizing model in the
1989-1991 campaign. The tactical change drew lessons from the model employed by
the AFSCME’s clerical organizing campaign at Harvard University and the
working women’s movement. The working women’s movement had a tremendous
impact on the labor movement, including style of organizing, what workplaces
could be seen as unionization targets, and what issues should be prioritized in
campaigns and contracts. This research, based on AFSCME archival collections at
the Walter Reuther Library at Wayne State University, the University Archives
at University of Minnesota, and oral histories with union organizers, provides
depth to the largely unknown history of the university workplace, working
women’s movement, and their union entry into the clerical organizing. Both
the local case study and the national context of organizing will be examined.</p>

<p>□  Jurisdictional Conflicts and the Battle for Canadian Bank Workers in the
1970s
To contribute to the conference theme of “Scales of Struggle” and the
sub-themes of “Borders and Coalitions” and “Struggling for Justice,”
this paper will examine the conflicts that occurred within the Canadian labour
movement in the 1970s over union organizing in the banking industry. This
period witnessed the greatest surge in bank worker unionization in Canadian
history. Initially, the unions and labour organizations involved worked
separately but alongside one another. Things changed in 1977 though, when two
independent unions successfully challenged a federal labour board ruling on
single-branch bargaining units. With branch certification now possible, large
unions and labour organizations that had failed or not bothered to organize
bank workers turned their attention to the banks. Bitter inter-union battles
soon erupted, most notably between the country’s largest labour federation
– the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) – and a small feminist union – the
Service, Office, and Retail Workers’ Union of Canada (SORWUC). As unions
expended time, energy, and resources debating who had jurisdiction over bank
employees, the banks waged a steady war against unionization in the branches,
in the media, and in the courts and, in the end, emerged victorious. The labour
movement’s inability and unwillingness to overcome ideological differences
and jurisdictional issues played a key role in the failure of the drives. As
such, the battle for Canadian bank workers that occurred in the 1970s serves as
a useful case study of why jurisdictional conflicts occur and how they harm
workers and the labour movement.</p>

<p>□  From Stewardess to Flight Attendant: Popular Culture, Workplace Relations
and Women’s Quest for Workplace Dignity in the Canadian Airline Industry
This paper draws on notions of the ‘stewardess’ in popular culture and
interrogates these against other historical sources detailing flight
attendants’ experience of the workplace. Although labor historians recognize
the importance of probing the ideological context in which workers work, we
tend to see popular culture as distorting or mystifying the ‘real’ world of
work. In this paper, we acknowledge that popular culture can play a mystifying
role, but we also argue that images created by popular culture nonetheless have
an important impact on how jobs are perceived and experienced by workers, as
well as how management shapes the workplace. While our example – flight
attendants – may seem particularly rich in terms of popular culture context,
we believe some of our conclusions about gender, race and class emerging from
the paper might be extrapolated to other jobs. Our paper examines popular
culture sources (advertising, novels, comic books, young adult fiction and
movies) from the 1940s to the early 1980s, detailing how these created images
of ‘the stewardess,’ with particular attention to gender roles, sexuality
and the family. We examine both Canadian and American primary sources,
indicating some of the cultural differences between this occupation as it
evolved in these two countries – and why. We also examine images changed over
time, and the way in which popular culture may have contained within it themes
that later aided the resistance of flight attendants to their sexualization on
the job. Finally, we contrast these popular sources to workplace grievances and
conflicts over issues relating to sexuality and the family expressed through
union battles, arbitration and media sources.</p> </p>
