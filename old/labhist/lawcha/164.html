<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The roundtable will explore the ideas, tensions, conflicts, and strategies
driving the activism of individuals and informing the policy perspectives of
labor organizations and governments in their quest to speak on behalf of
workers’ concerns and shape transnational worker solidarities during the Cold
War. In the Cold War struggle from 1947 to the fall of the Berlin Wall,
national and transnational labor organizations have fallen along a spectrum
from voluntary to coercive compliance to the foreign policy objectives of the
countries and regions under which they operated. At other times they have
sought to influence the policy perspectives of governments to support their own
foreign policy positions and economic objectives. During and after the period
of decolonization, the divisions between East and West intersected with the
divisions of North and South to produce a variegated politics shaped by
identities of race, gender, nation, and ethnicity. This roundtable seeks to
understand how these disparate identities influenced rhetoric, perspectives and
activism, and solidarities in a transnational context. In what ways did
activists and labor organizations react to the Cold War confrontation between a
bipolar order and the rising tide of neutralism?  How did contact across
borders affect the way individual labor activists assessed the Cold War,
anti-colonialism, and inequalities and injustices within the various blocs? To
what extent did the mapping of the East-West conflict onto the newly
independent governments produce corrupting influences and political differences
that constricted movement toward a greater transnational labor solidarity?  How
did the Cold War affect transnational labor’s views of solutions to global
economic disparities?</p>

<p>Yevette Richards will examine how Cold war and decolonization affected the
relationship between Ugandan labor and government officials and the
non-communist global labor body, the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions, which operated a labor college in the country.                               </p>

<p>This
study
exposes
fissures within the Ugandan government that had repercussions for the labor
movement, some of whose leaders doubled as government officials. Ethnic
rivalries, gender politics, and internal power plays within Uganda were mapped
onto a Cold War landscape in which the ICFTU found itself challenged to support
major tenets of pan-Africanism without abdicating its principles of trade
unions free from government control.</p>

<p>Lara Vapnek will discuss American women’s participation in the Women’s
International Democratic Federation (WIDF) an organization formed in Paris in
1945 to fight fascism, promote gender equality, and support decolonization.  In
1949, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) accused the WIDF, and
its American affiliate, the Congress of American Women, of being communist
front organizations.  This episode suggests the challenges American activists
faced in building left-feminist alliances across national boundaries during the
Cold War.</p>

<p>Quenby Hughes will discuss the intersection between AFL and CIO Cold War
international and domestic policy/rhetoric of the AFL and the CIO, specifically
as it relates to race and racism at home.</p>

<p>John Stoner will discuss the implications of the AFL-CIO’s engagement with
tenets of modernization theory in its outreach efforts to fledgling labor
organizations, especially those in the Africa. <br />
In
post-Nkrumah
Ghana,
the
AFL-CIO’s African American Labor Center (AALC) partnered with USAID to
propose an ambitious scheme for workers’ housing.  The narrative of the
project’s failure includes a critique of labor-government collusion that
prioritized political ends over social good.</p> </p>
