<h4>Coal Miners and Class Identity in the Japanese Labor Movement: 1912-1928</h4>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The historiography of the Japanese labor movement in the early 20th century has
typically adopted a simplistic narrative, pitting the burgeoning union movement
against state and corporate efforts to ameliorate the so-called “labor
problem” through appeals to industrial harmony. Within this narrative
framework, the fate of an already-formed working class was determined through
legislation, company reforms, and violent encounters. However, the mobilization
of the working class by labor leaders, itself a contentious process demanding
the articulation of a shared class identity, remains unexamined in these works.</p>

<p>My paper analyzes the challenges faced by local labor activists as they
attempted to foster and articulate class identifications through an analysis of
the works of two activists from the coal mining region of Chikuhō in southwest
Japan: Mitsuyoshi Esshin and Hashimoto Eikichi.</p>

<p>Both Mitsuyoshi and Hashimoto are notable for being former coal miners who
joined Japan’s national labor movement. Both were committed to mobilizing
Chikuhō’s miners in the wake of increasingly violent unrest in the region.
However, they faced a challenge in articulating a class identity for miners
that both integrated the latter into the larger labor movement while appealing
to existing regional and occupational identities. The resulting works betray an
underlying tension between their affirmation of a class identity that crossed
occupational boundaries and their tendency to ground their narrative of social
revolution in the specificities of mining life. Consequently, in mobilizing
their personal histories and intimate knowledge of mining work, both writers
often reinforced claims that Japan’s miners possessed a unique occupational
culture, which was simultaneously being used by industrialists to legitimize
paternalistic management practices and challenge state or union intervention.</p>

<p>My paper thus explores two themes that permeated coalition building and class
mobilization efforts in Japan. Firstly, it analyzes the tension between
particularity and universality in class discourse. Secondly, it emphasizes the
permeability of class identity itself and the indeterminacy of its
articulation, especially in non-Western contexts.</p> </p>
