<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Jim Green’s Legacy: Doing Labor History in Public Spaces</p>

<p>The passing of Jim Green, a founding member and the 3rd President of LAWCHA, in
June 2016, brought to a close the long and illustrious career of a dedicated
and highly productive labor historian.                                      His
published
work,
beginning
with his
path-breaking study of Southwest populism and socialism (Grassroots Socialism)
and ending with his widely acclaimed examination of the West Virginia mine wars
(The Devil is Here in these Hills) and the two-hour American Experience film
based on that work, provide only the most visible markers of a many-faceted
life deeply dedicated to expanding the public’s understanding of the lives
and struggles of working people.</p>

<p>In this roundtable we want to illuminate many aspects of Jim’s dedication to
“doing labor history in public spaces” and facilitate a discussion about
the ways in which Jim carried forward this work in his life, and consider how
we can or are doing so in our own spheres of activity.                               </p>

<p>In
this
period of
political reaction and attacks on the labor movement, it is especially vital to
consider ways to enhance the “public” work of labor history.  We hope this
session can provide the occasion for such a discussion, as we honor Jim’s own
commitment to this ideal.  </p>

<p>The participants in the roundtable will each make a brief presentation
highlighting different aspects of Jim’s work: Susan Reverby (Wellesley
College) on working with Jim and others to establish the Massachusetts History
Workshop that brought academics, trade unionists and the public together
through conferences, oral history projects, publication of pamphlets, and
organization of commemorations and walking tours; Elaine Bernard (Harvard) on
the trade union education work which Jim deeply loved and in which he played
such an integral role over many years; Lou Martin (Chatham University) on his
work with Jim on the research for the mine wars book and Jim’s commitment to
writing a more accessible labor history for a wider public, as well as Jim’s
support for the establishment of a mine wars museum in Matewan.  Shel
Stromquist will chair the session and speak about Jim’s work building and
nurturing the Labor and Working-Class History Association.  (One additional
participant may join the panel)</p> </p>
