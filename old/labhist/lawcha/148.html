<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This roundtable brings together scholars who are working on the past and present of global labor migration. It builds upon and reflects a larger project spearheaded by the Center for Global Labor Migration at the University of Maryland to build an international and interdisciplinary network of scholars working on labor migration. According to the United Nations, 232 million people live today in countries beyond their nation of origin. Most of those are migrant workers. If one counts migrant laborers who are working outside their region of birth, the number more than doubles--China alone has nearly 200 million people working outside their region of birth. Migrant laborers typically work without much protection; many are undocumented or working in conditions of severe coercion due to unfair labor contracts. This roundtable will examine different ways of approaching the historical and contemporary challenges involved in migrant labor around the world. Nelson Lichtenstein will examine how supply chains contribute to labor exploitation; Eileen Boris will consider the past and present of ILO efforts to pass and enforce standards; Nafisa Tanjeem will examine Bangladeshi labor activism (in both Bangladesh and the USA), examining different actors and institutions located across various nodes of the apparel supply chain; Annelise Orleck will draw on her current research into labor migrants' activism across Asia.</p> </p>
