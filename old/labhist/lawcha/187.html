<h4>Abstract</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>□  Radical Religion: The Catholic Church and the War on Poverty in Brooklyn
The Catholic Church was (and remains) defined by boundaries – between
parishes, dioceses, and priests and parishioners. By the late 1960s, those
boundaries were also racial and political. The majority of Catholic
parishioners were white and conservative, but a small and active contingent of
black Catholic churches emerged to challenge the politics of their
coreligionists. This paper will examine the alliances that arose to overcome
parish and racial boundaries in Brooklyn and, in particular, how a contingent
of “radical” priests and nuns allied with liberal white Catholics, black
and Puerto Rican Catholics, community activists, and like-minded organizations
to spearhead a number of progressive programs – including non-profit housing
corporations and welfare rights organizations – that were inspired by the
Gospel but performed in the streets of the city. Significantly, the majority of
these efforts were made possible through the Great Society’s Office of
Economic Opportunity, as well as a “diocesan war on poverty.” This paper
thus explores the combined efforts of the Church and the state to intervene in
systems of poverty and discrimination, but also chronicles their ultimate
failures. We are rich in histories of the Great Society from the perspective of
politicians and bureaucrats, but this paper provides a grassroots perspective
of the community institutions that carried out the OEO’s mission – from its
well-funded initial outburst to its slow withdrawal that crippled progressive
organizations. This paper will argue that the Catholic Church is an exemplary
case study for examining the failures of the War on Poverty because it allows
historians to view the program in microcosm, revealing how progressive,
interracial efforts to alleviate poverty were abandoned to fund those that, as
one Brooklyn Catholic argued, would not disrupt “the sanctity of the status
quo.” The Church, like the state, failed to truly challenge the boundaries of
inequality in American cities.</p>

<p>□  The Ambiguities of Catholic Inter-racialism in 1950s Chicago: Friendship
House and the Catholic Interracial Council
This paper examines the activities of the Catholic Interracial Council in
Chicago as well its affiliated Friendship House from the mid-1940s through the
1950s under the liberal Bishop Bernard J. Sheil. Indeed, Sheil preached about
the "doom" of racism in 1943 in light of the atrocities committed in Nazi
Germany. This paper considers the relationship of these progressive Catholic
institutions to the political dynamics of the Catholic archdiocese of Chicago
and the U.S. Catholic church generally during the early years of the Cold War
as well as the important missions the church had with working class migrant
communities in the Windy City, particularly Polish and African American
communities. It considers especially how issues of racial discrimination were
discussed in the context of growing early Cold War acrimonies between the
radical left and Catholic workers movements which often leaned towards
conservative ends of the political spectrum and the complexities of ethnic and
racial identities that came to light as a result of these dynamics.</p>

<p>□  Love of Labor Lost? Religion, Human Rights, and the Argentine “Dirty
War"
The Argentine “Dirty War,” which followed the 1976 anti-Peron coup and the
international human rights movement it sparked are well-studied topics. This
paper, touching on the conference subtheme of War and Empire will spotlight the
activist role of religious leaders such as Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer, who was
well known for his role in promoting domestic and international social justice
and for bringing the widespread human rights abuses in Argentina to public
attention. Meyer's role in raising awareness of the human rights abuses of the
Argentine junta is laudable in terms of bringing social justice concerns into
the Jewish and general religious mainstream. However, it is also important to
look at Meyer's role (and that of similar religious leaders) in downplaying the
labor aspects of the Argentine human rights tragedy, the better to deflect
negative associations of human rights with political leftism in the waning Cold
War, and to broaden the base of support. These efforts, in turn, may have
played into the hands of the Videla regime, which pointedly used terror to
silence the workers' movements that formed an important component of the
opposition. Meyer and his like-minded clerical colleagues therefore may also
have contributed to the marginalization of labor and class issues from the
progressive religious activism they helped to create, and with it, the popular
conception of human rights.</p> </p>
