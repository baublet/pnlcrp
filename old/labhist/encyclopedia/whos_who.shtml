            <h2><a name="brannin"></a>Carl  Brannin (1888-1985)</h2>
            <p>Carl Brannin’s affiliation and leadership  in the Seattle Labor College, ACLU, and Unemployed Citizens’ League  led to improvements for the unemployed, workers and non-workers alike during  the Great Depression. As editor of Vanguard, his ideas and teachings for reform  fell into the hands of many throughout Seattle, creating an air for change.  
            On September   22, 1888 in  Cisco, Texas, Carl Brannin, a devoted social activist  and talented journalist, was born. Brannin’s contribution to political  and social reform impacted  several large cities across America; his influence did not fail to reach Washington. Carl Brannin began his lifelong  struggle for social justice and perfected his journalistic abilities while  attending the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. <br>
            <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morebrannin');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="morebrannin" style="display:none;"></p>
          <p>Soon after  graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Textile Engineering from Texas A&amp;M,  Brannin stumbled upon a novel that would inspire him to take an active role as  a political and social reformer. <em>Progress  and Poverty</em>,writtenby the economist Henry George,  discussed a single-tax theory and stressed the importance of cooperation and  social responsibility (deFord 5). In addition to Henry George, other socially  conscious authors like Upton Sinclair, Walter Rauschenbusch and Charles M.  Sheldon inspired Brannin. In 1914, after being involved  in community welfare programs in Dallas,   Texas,  he accepted a job as the assistant to the reverend of the People’s Church in Cincinnati.  While working for the Missouri   Land  and Labor League, Brannin met Laura Haeckl (deFord 16). Their shared passion  for the common good connected them instantly and the couple wed in 1918.<br>
          <p>A year after  the wedding, Carl accepted the position of organizer and  publicist for the Plumb Plan League,  an organization who advocated public ownership of railroads. In 1920, the  League relocated the Brannins to the progressive city of Seattle, Washington to endorse the organizations campaign.  While in Seattle, Brannin struggled to find a steady job  because of the skyrocketing unemployment rates caused by the economic  depression. Despite his failed jobs, Brannin became acquainted with the radical  communities within the city. In their spare time, the couple took part in  political activism, such as rallies and strikes across Seattle. After two years of unsuccessful  job-hunting, Brannin received good news from Texas - oil had been discovered on  a small farm that had been passed down to Carl from his aunt. This discovery  provided the couple with a steady income that allowed them to travel within the  nation and abroad. <br>
          <p>After  extensive traveling, the Brannins returned to Seattle in 1925 and adopted a son, Robert  Brannin. Following the couple’s return, Carl turned his attention to the labor  and radical movements within the city. He became involved in the Seattle Labor College, a school that educated workers on  current issues of economics and the working-class, advocated better working  conditions for laborers and created solidarity among workers. (Eigner). Brannin  participation at the Labor   College included holding lectures and debates. Eventually,  he became director of the college’s Open Forum and, ultimately, the director of  the college. In January 1930, the Seattle Labor College began publishing <em>The Vanguard</em>, a progressive newspaper that became an educational  instrument for, and the voice of, unemployed workers. <em>The Vanguard</em>, which Brannin founded and edited, was used as a  platform for the Seattle Labor College, the United Citizens League and the  local Socialist Party (Eigner). In 1931, Brannin played a key role in  developing a Washington chapter of the American Civil Liberties  Union, which was founded to defend the constitutional rights of citizens. <br>
          <p>In addition  to his work for the Seattle Labor College and ACLU, Brannin also co-founded the  Unemployed Citizens League of King County with J.F. Cronnin and Hulet M. Wells,  friends and fellow activists. The League worked to achieve political  representation and relief for unemployed citizens from local governments and  promoted self-help among members. In 1933, the UCL, in collaboration with other  organizations, organized several marches to Olympia, Washington to demand relief for the starving,  unemployment insurance and free utilities. The marches proved successful. After  gaining national attention and becoming a powerful political force, the UCL  began to segregate into a Socialist and Communist faction. In response to this  political rivalry within the organization, Brannin gave his resignation as  executive secretary of the United Citizens League of Seattle in 1932. <br>
          <p>Carl and  Laura Brannin’s life in Seattle came to an end in March of 1933; the  family decided to return to Dallas,   Texas. Although the couple left Seattle, they did not leave their fervor for  reform behind. Both continued to participate actively in politics and the civil  rights movement, as “crusaders for the common good” (deFord iii). After Laura  died of cancer in 1965, Carl did not cease in his service to his community  until his death on June 16, 1985.  -- Dana Mason</p>  </div>

            <h2> <a name="brooks"></a>Carl Brooks (1908- )</h2>
           <p>Carl Brooks was a civil rights activist, labor leader, and member of the Communist Party (CP) in the state of Washington. Born in 1908 and raised in Seattle, in 1934 Brooks replaced Revels Cayton as president of the League of Struggle for Negro Rights and during his brief tenure led a number of direct-action protests against segregated businesses in Seattle. In the mid to late 1930s, Brooks, along with several other local Communists, became active in the Washington Commonwealth Federation (WCF), a collection of labor unions and political reformists that quickly emerged as a influential left-wing caucus of the state Democratic Party. In November of 1936, Brooks campaigned on the WCF platform for the state legislature. The following year he represented the WCF in Philadelphia at the second National Negro Congress, a Popular Front effort to unite the various civil rights organizations operating at the time under a single banner. <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morebrooks');return false;">More...</a></p> 
<div id="morebrooks" style="display:none;">
<p>As the leading African American in the Washington Commonwealth Federation, Brooks also spearheaded the WCF's involvement in a number of local civil rights struggles throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, including efforts to block an anti-interracial marriage bill introduced in 1937, protests against two high-profile police brutality cases involving African American victims in 1938 and 1943, and the WCF's successful campaign to integrate West Seattle's Colman public swimming pool in 1941. As a politically active African American and a member of the Communist Party, Brooks faced a doubled risk of violence and repression. In 1943 his home was firebombed in an effort to enforce a restrictive housing covenant and pressure his family out of its predominantly white neighborhood. In 1947, Brooks became a target of the state legislature's investigative committee on un-American activities, known as the Canwell Committee after its founder and chairman, State Representative Albert Canwell. Although he was never called to testify, Brooks created a stir when he interrupted the testimony of former African American Communist George Hewitt to denounce the proceedings, after which he was forcibly removed from the building. Brooks remained active in union politics through the 1950s, serving as President of the militant Shipscalers Union, and in electoral politics, campaigning for Seattle City Council on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948. However, perhaps because of the anticommunist backlash, scant evidence survives of Brooks' later years and it is unclear when he died or whether he stayed in Seattle after the mid 1950s. –Daren Salter </p>

		   <h2> <a name="bullitt"></a>A. Scott Bullitt (1877-1932)</h2>
              <p><img src="images/whos_who/bullitt.jpg" width="82.25" height="120" class= leftsmall>Alexander Scott Bullitt II was a leader in  the development and strengthening of the Democratic Party in Washington State. Never elected to state or national office, Bullitt worked to build the Party as Washington State Democratic National Committeeman from 1928 until his untimely death in 1932.  Although he had a relatively short career, Bullitt left an indelible mark on party poltics in the state.
                      
              Bullitt was born in Louisville, Kentucky on January 23, 1877. The history of the Bullitt  family is filled with ties to politics and law; so, it was only natural that A.  Scott Bullitt followed in his ancestors footsteps. 
            <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morebullitt');return false;">More...</a></p> 
<div id="morebullitt" style="display:none;">      
              <p>Bullitt lived in Louisville until he left to attend the University of Virginia. After two years, Bullitt transferred to  his dream school, Princeton. After graduating with his Bachelors of  Arts from Princeton, Bullitt continued his education at Louisville Law School. In 1899 he graduated with his law  degree and was admitted to the Kentucky Bar (Bullitt 309, 311).
              A. Scott Bullitt began practicing law as  a jury lawyer. Shortly after he had begun his practice, Governor J. C. W.  Beckham appointed Bullitt as the temporary Sheriff of Jefferson County. His  short yet successful run as Sheriff gave Bullitt the political support needed  to win the position of Jefferson County Attorney. Bullitt served two terms at  the position (Bullitt 312). After losing his third campaign for Jefferson  County Attorney in 1918, Bullitt became the Democratic Election Commissioner  for the county. The same year he met and married Dorothy Stimson whom would  become equally as prominent in Washington.</p>
<p>In 1920, after serving in the Army for  two years, A. Scott Bullitt moved to Seattle. In Seattle, the couple found themselves at odds in  the political community. During the 1920’s Republicans overran Seattle, leaving the Democratic Party lagging  far behind. Scott Bullitt became the leading progressive Democrat in the city  (Bullitt 316). In 1924 he attended the Democratic National Convention as a delegate.  Two years later, he ran for the U.S. Senate. Although he lost the race,  Bullitt’s fight stimulated the Democratic Party in Washington State. During his campaign, Bullitt supported  loosening the prohibition laws, raising farm prices and opposed the federal  bill that proposed tax cuts for the wealthy. <br>
          <p>Just after the 1928 election, Scott was  appointed as Washington State Democratic National Committeeman. During the 1930  State Convention, Bullitt proposed the repeal of the 18th Amendment.  His motion passed. A year later, Scott was appointed as part of a temporary  Board of Councilors for an organization called the “Minute Men of the  Democratic National Committee” (Geraghty, 1:22). <br>
          <p>His last action for the Democratic Party  was the endorsement of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Bullitt was responsible for the  organization of the campaign for FDR in the Northwest (Bullitt 318). On April   10, 1932,  shortly after he endorsed FDR at the Washington State Convention, Bullitt died  of liver and gall bladder cancer. <br>
          <p>Though his political career was short,  Alexander Scott Bullitt’s influence in Washington State’s Democratic Party was incomparable. He  helped make Seattle a stronghold of liberal poltics and his talent  and charm influenced many, including future senator Warren G. Magnuson. -- Dana Mason</p>

            <p><img src="images/whos_who/caughlan181jpg.jpg" width="82" height="120" class="leftsmall">John Caughlan was instrumental in championing the civil rights of Communist Party members in a legal career spanning six decades. Born in Missouri in 1909 and raised in Seattle, he returned to the Northwest after completing a law degree at Harvard in 1935. He worked briefly for the King County Prosecutor&#39;s Office before taking a leave of absence to defend Communists during a red scare in Grays Harbor County. After representing the Grays Harbor Civil Rights Committee he was blocked from returning to his job at King County after refusing to denounce the Soviet Union. Thereafter, he went into private practice and took on some of the most celebrated cases involving Communists and unions in Washington State. <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morecaughlan');return false;">More...</a></p>
            <div id="morecaughlan" style="display:none;">
              <p>He won the right of the Communist Party to field candidates in Washington State elections, defended Communists in proceedings and trials to prevent deportation or incarceration for being members of the Communist Party. He even successfully defended Grays Harbor CP member Dick Law, who was accused by authorities of murdering his wife amid the hysteria of a red scare. His defense of a Seattle machinist charged under the McCarran Act ended up in the US Supreme Court. Although he publicly denied membership in the Communist Party, Caughlan acknowledged, in an unpublished biography, that he joined a &quot;unit&quot; of the party in late 1937 or early 1938. He died, aged 90, in 1999. --Gordon Black

He joined the Northwest District of the Communist Party in 1934 after serving as secretary of the local chapter of the International Labor Defense. That same year he organized a Seattle chapter of the CP's League of Struggle for Negro Rights and campaigned for city council on the Communist Party ticket. Cayton spearheaded most of the Northwest Party's early initiatives on behalf of African American rights, including actions against segregeted businesses and a proposed legislative ban on interracial marriage, support for the   Scottsboro defendants, and the Party's campaign for the freedom of accused murderer  Theodore Jordan.

						<p>In addition to his role in the Communist Party, Cayton was a leader in the Marine Cooks and Stewards union (MCS) on the West Coast. When the 1934 waterfront strike began, he left Seattle for San Francisco to organize for the MCS. As a union activist with the MCS and later as Vice President of the California State CIO, Cayton was a tireless advocate for the rights of workers, especially African Americans. In 1945 he was appointed as executive secretary of the National Negro Congress, an umbrella organization of civil rights and progressive labor organizations that was aligned with the Communist Party. When the NNC folded two years later, he returned to California and began to slowly drift away from the Communist Party although he continued to support its ideals. In the 1960s Cayton served on the San Francisco Human Rights Commission and as a deputy mayor for social programs. He died in 1995 at the age of eighty-eight. –Daren Salter</p>

            <p><img src="images/whos_who/costigan120h.jpg" width="86" height="120" class= leftsmall>Born in 1904, Howard Costigan grew up in Seattle but graduated Centralia High School, where he became president of the student body. He was also a member of the Centralia High debate club for three years. He said he witnessed the infamous assault on the IWW (Wobblies) Hall in Centralia by American Legionnaires on November 11, 1919, an event that shaped the direction of his life to fight for social and economic justice. He attended Whitman College and Bellingham Normal School and trained as a teacher. Costigan rose to prominence as a result of nightly and then twice-nightly political commentaries on KPCB radio. He was also the leading force in publishing the Washington Commonwealth Builder, the journal of the Washington Commonwealth Federation [link to web site on WCF material from earlier class]. In 1936, with the ban on Communist participation in the WCF lifted, he was asked to join the party. This was the era when the WCF became one of the &quot;front&quot; organizations of the Communist Party. <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morecostigan');return false;">More...</a></P>
        
        <div id="morecostigan" style="display:none;">
			  <p> The party was then adamantly anti-Nazi and supportive of the Roosevelt administration. But following the 1939 Non-aggression pact between Stalin and Hitler, the CP position on Roosevelt changed, which put Costigan in a tough spot, he later told the Canwell Hearings [link]. The Soviet invasion of Finland furthered his doubts about the Party. According to Eugene Dennett, Costigan went on a religious retreat in 1940. He left the party soon afterwards and testified before the Canwell hearings in 1948. By this point, Costigan had become bitterly opposed to the Communist Party as &quot;undemocratic.&quot; Following his testimony, he was vilified by the Communist Party&#39;s newspaper, &quot;New World.&quot; Revelations that he was an ex-Communist also cost him his broadcasting job, and he came to hate the Canwell Committee to the degree he disliked the Communist Party. He twice ran (1944 and 1946) for the Democratic nomination in opposition to Congressman Hugh Delacy, who was closely linked to the Communist Party. Costigan lost both times but in 1946 Delacy was subsequently defeated by a Republican in the general election. Costigan moved to California in the fifties, settling first in the Los Angeles area and then in Fresno, where he died, aged 81, in 1985.

            <p> <img src="images/whos_who/cumming.jpg" width="95" height="120" class= leftsmall> A nationally regarded painter, a remarkable  teacher and political radical, Bill Cumming’s fiery spirit and immense talent  has shaped Northwest art for over ninety years. A founding influence of the Northwest School, Cumming worked as a painter with the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, and was active in the Communist Party until 1957.  In the 1960s Cumming began a teaching career at the Burnley School of Professional Art, later renamed the Seattle Art Institute, that continues to this day. <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morecumming');return false;">More...</a></p>        
<div id="morecumming" style="display:none;">
            
            <p>William Cumming was born on March   24, 1917 in Montana. His family moved to Oregon when Cumming was a toddler. A few years  later, they traveled to Tukwila,   Washington, a small town composed of farms.  Cumming’s passion for art was revealed at a young age and was encouraged by  friends and family. He attended an art course at the International  Correspondence School but stopped shortly after classes began, stating that  formal learning didn’t suit him. After graduating high school in 1934, Cumming  attempted to attend another formal art institute, the Northwest Academy of Art.  Once again, Cumming didn’t feel the education was adequate and dropped out a  year after enrolling. After his failed attempts at formal training, Cumming spent  the next few years making social and political connections throughout Seattle and working on perfecting and improving  his artistic abilities.<br>
            <p>William was introduced to many  prominent artists that would make up the Northwest School of Art. These artists  would act as companions and critics for Cumming. Margaret Callahan would be  Cumming’s biggest critic and biggest influence. Callahan criticized Cumming for  replicating Modigliani and Pascin and recommended that he utilize his talent of  portraying bodies in motion. Her comments would have a profound impact on his  artistic career. In his memoir, <em>Sketchbook</em>,  Cumming recalls Callahan’s importance, “Margaret empowered me to be here, be  now, and create my art out of that power of being (140).” With Callahan’s  recommendations, as well as other artists’, Cumming’s work became stronger. He  gradually entered his pieces into art shows and by 1941 had earned a solo show  at the Seattle Art Museum without a pervious display at a  commercial gallery, an unprecedented accomplishment. Despite his good luck in  the art world, Cumming fell sick of tuberculosis in 1942. He spent a year and a  half in Firland Sanatorium before returning home (Cumming, HistoryLink). In  spite of his recovery, Cumming could not work. <br>
            <p>In 1945, he read <em>Ten Days That  Shook the World, </em>a book chronicling the  Russian Revolution. The book had such an impact on Cumming that he joined the  Communist Party shortly thereafter (Cumming, HistoryLInk). Cumming participated  in the Party by working on the Russian war relief in Spokane. Soon, his dedication  to politics exceeded his dedication to the arts. Cumming worked on formulating  support for Trotskyism across Washington State. However, his  commitment to the Communist Party was chastised during the McCarthy era when he  was blacklisted. This exclusion lasted nearly six years. In 1957, Cumming ended  his membership with the Communist Party and the radical movement entirely. His  passion for painting was relinquished. 
            <p>After  his affiliation with the Communist Party ended, Cumming continued to create  highly regarded works of art, which he displayed and sold at numerous art  shows. In 1963, he began teaching classes at the Burnley School of Professional Art.  During the 1980’s the school was renamed the Art Institute of Seattle (Cumming,  HistoryLink). Bill continues to teach at the Art Institute to this day. -- Dana Mason</P>

He was born in Seattle in 1901 and worked as a marine fireman and a laborer before earning a Master's Degree in English at the University of Washington in 1932. He first gained notoriety in 1937 when he decided to campaign for the Seattle City Council. At the time DeLacy was a young English professor at the UW, but was fired by the university when he declared his candidacy. DeLacy's dismissal provoked a storm of protest among progressives and labor groups, led by the Washington Commonwealth Federation.

The Democratic Party, which turned rightward after World War II, refused to endorse him for reelection in 1946 and he was defeated. DeLacy next turned to Henry Wallace's Progressive Party, directing the Ohio branch of the party after his term in Congress ended. He spent the last years of his life in the Los Angeles area working as a carpenter and contractor. He died of cancer in 1976. –Daren Salter</p>

            <h2><a name="dennett"></a>Eugene Dennett (1908-1989)</h2>
        
            <p>
              Dennett, the son of socialists who named him after socialist presidential candidate Eugene Debs, was born in Massachusetts in 1908 and raised in Oregon. He trained as a teacher and was living in Portland when he joined the Communist Party in 1931. The following year, he quit his job to become district agitprop in Seattle. Working in both Seattle and later Bellingham, he became active in the Inland Boatmen&#39;s Union and helped to recruit members for the party. As a result of a red scare arising from early inquiries of the state committee on Un-American activities set up by Senator Albert Canwell [link], Dennett was rumored to be an FBI informant, a charge he denied. During meetings with the disciplinary arm of the Communist Party, the District Control Commission, Dennett was accused of being &quot;subjective&quot; and of holding an &quot;anti-leadership attitude.

        <p>From Gordon Black's paper <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/cpproject/black.shtml" target="_blank"> <em>Organizing the Unemployed</em></a>: &quot; Northwest party chairman Henry Huff and district organizing secretary Clayton Van Lydegraf signed his expulsion letter from the Communist Party. Although he was only a party member for 16 years, Dennett&#39;s legacy extended well beyond his period of membership. He was an aggrieved party member who ultimately sought to redress his unfair treatment by providing testimony to the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1955. This, in turn, further alienated him from many in the Communist Party and on the Left, though he continued to be active in the Steelworkers&#39; Union. He was expelled from it in 1954. Dennett&#39;s book, <em>Agitprop The Life of an American Working-Class Radical: The Autobiography of Eugene V. Dennett</em> is one of the few comprehensive accounts written by someone inside the Communist Party in the Northwest.&quot; 
</p> 
<p>Dennett speaks of his early experiences with the working-class, “…I saw squalor and misery among honest, hard working people who lived, worked, and died without experiencing the real joys of living” (Dennett 2).  His awareness of class conflict and oppression was intensified during high school when a family friend recommended that Dennett read socialist pamphlets and other books.  These included Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll’s 44 Lectures Complete, which taught him that religion was not the solution to social problems (Dennett 4). <p>After graduating from college, Dennett began teaching elementary school in Oregon.
In 1931, depression was sweeping across America. Although he remained employed as a teacher, his pockets took a heavy hit. The same year, Dennett joined the Communist Party looking for like-minded people who were hoping for change in the economic and social atmosphere of America. Under the Party, he assumed the pseudonym “Victor Haines” and worked on agitprop with the Northwestern Party District Bureau in Seattle.
In 1932 unemployment was a critical issue in Seattle. In his autobiograpny Dennett recalls that the only people who were employed in Seattle were government employees; however, even those workers received wage cuts (Dennett 7). The <p>Unemployed Citizens League concentrated their efforts on unemployment relief by lobbying politicians. The politicians promised to allocate more aid under one condition: the UCL must ban all Communist affiliates from speaking at engagements. Although the UCL agreed to these terms, Dennett was one of the few Communist members that were allowed to speak at UCL activities. In these speeches, he advocated a change in the economic and political systems of America. Dennett suggested resisting utility shut-offs and evictions while leaders worked to change the systems. Dennett was a strong supporter of the UCL; this was one of the many disagreements between his ideologies and those of the national leaders of the Communist Party. 
<p>Throughout his time as a member of the Party, Dennett was constantly coming into conflict with Northwest Party leaders. “Dennett was an idealist who sought to unify theoretical principle, policy, and practice (Dennett x).” In 1932, Dennett moved from Seattle to Bellingham after a public disagreement between himself and Party district organizer, Alex Noral.
<p> In Bellingham, Dennett assumed the position of Party organizer. When he arrived there were only seven members in the city of Bellingham. The members were extremely disciplined but removed from political activity (Dennett 32). Dennett believed that the Bellingham sector needed to become more visible to the public; thus, he urged the seven members to join the People’s Council of Bellingham. Although this was against the Party’s policies, Dennett saw it in the members’ best interest. The People’s Council met regularly, charged minimal dues, held protests, advocated relief for the hungry and resisted evictions. Because of Dennett’s participation, many members from the People’s Council joined the Communist Party. Within his short time in Bellingham, the local sector of the Party grew to over one hundred and fifty members. The growth in members gave Dennett the support he needed to start a Marxist school (Dennett 45). 
<p>After returning to Seattle in 1933, Dennett’s participation with the Party nearly ceased. The lack of responsibilities being delegated to him led him to become involved in several other labor organizations, unions and political movements. Shortly after returning, he assisted the Marine Workers Industrial Union and the Central UCL. In spring of 1934, Dennett became a member of the Civilian Conservation Corps. While a member of the CCC, Dennett participated in the Longshoremen’s Strike of 1934. However, he was expelled from the organization in 1935 due to his “radical, pro-labor leanings (Dennett xii).” His expulsion did not slow him down.
Shortly after his expulsion, Dennett became a maritime worker. While working, he played an important role in the Ferryboatmen’s strikes of 1935 and 1936. His leadership in these strikes caught the eye of local Communist Party leaders and he was recruited as district leader once again. Later in 1936, Dennett became active in the Washington Commonwealth Foundation. Through the WCF he managed the campaign of Seattle City Councilmember Hugh DeLacy. Eventually, Dennett was elected president of the Washington Commonwealth Foundation. 
<p>In addition to his participation and leadership in the WCF, Dennett was a member and supporter of the state CIO Political Welfare Committee, Party Bureau(?), Maritime Federation of the Pacific, Seattle Central Labor Council, AFL’s Committee for Industrial Organization, and Washington Industrial Union Council (WIUC-CIO). After becoming a member of the WIUC-CIO, Dennett was elected the first Executive Secretary of the organization. He held this position for two years before he was removed from office in 1940 due to a conflict with regional and national CIO leaders.
<p>After returning from service during WWII, Dennett noticed a change in the Communist Party and felt he no longer “fit in” (Dennett xv). In 1947, he was expelled from the Party on accusations of being an informant. After his expulsion from the Party, Dennett worked in the Steel Workers Organizing Committee as recording secretary and grievance committeeman. In these positions, he helped achieve safer working conditions, justice on the job and the highest possible wages for shopmates. In 1954, Dennett was expelled from the Steel Workers Union, however, the discharge “…appears to have been a blatantly framed-up expulsion.” (Dennett xv) He continued working until he retired in 1972.
<p>Although Eugene Dennett’s struggle to combine socialist and democratic ideals often resulted in disagreements between him and other activist leaders, he made great strides to implement solutions for the working-class. A natural born leader and passionate radical, Dennett had a profound and lasting influence on Washington State’s labor and political movements. -- Dana Mason </p>

        <p><img src="images/whos_who/dore.jpg" width="95" height="120" class= leftsmall>John F. Dore’s served as mayor of Seattle from 1932-1934 and again from 1936 until his death in 1938. He began his political career as a fiscal conservative but by his second term he had almost completely reversed his ideology, defending labor, refusing to cut wages for municipal workers and supporting strikers.         John Francis Dore was born December 11, 1881 in Boston, Massachusetts but moved to Seattle with his family in 1893 (Wilma). He returned to Massachusetts to attend Harvard then came back to Seattle in 1903 to work as a journalist for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer among other newspapers.

        <div id="moredore" style="display:none;">
          <p>A successful trial attorney, Dore ran for prosecuting attorney in 1930 proposing to serve without pay which his opponents declared a form of bribery to the constituents. Dore lost the campaign and despite an attempt to have him disbarred he was cleared of all charges. His break came in 1931 when incumbent Mayor Frank Edwards fired popular Seattle Light superintendent James Ross resulting in a public outcry. Voters recalled Frank Edwards and in 1932 Dore ran against the appointed replacement, Robert Harlin, easily winning the election. 
          <p>Immediately after taking office Dore cut municipal workers pay as well as the city budget by 2.5 million (Wilma). Despite the overwhelming disapproval of his cost cutting efforts Dore continued to lay off employees and reduce services (University). He did work with other Puget Sound mayors in order to convince Governor Roland Hartley to distribute relief funds, but to no avail. The Mayor and the Unemployed Citizens League disagreed over how the relief funds should be used and he distanced himself even further from unemployed voters when he spoke out against a UCL march. All this cost Dore the election in 1934 to Charles L. Smith. 
          <p>An interesting transition came when Dore sought the office of mayor again in 1936. This time he forged a strong relationship with Teamster leader Dave Beck. In his 1936 mayorship campaign Dore declared no wage cuts for municipal workers and strongly supported the labor movement (Wilma). This time he won. He publicly proclaimed to repay Dave Beck for all his help in the campaign and stood true to his word. On August 13, 1936 the American Newspaper Guild strikes the Seattle P-I and Dore refuses to send police to the picket lines. He even joins the strike to show his support (Wilma). The strike grows and moves to the Seattle Times and the Star finally prompting the papers to settle with the strikers. The relationship with Dave Beck is mutually beneficial. Beck’s career blooms with Dore’s support. 
          <p>Failing health towards the end of 1937 stopped Dore from serving as mayor although he still fileed for reelection. He lost the race to Arthur Langlie and on April 18, 1938, while still Mayor of Seattle passes away from complications due to the flu and pneumonia (Wilma).   -- Christopher Smith       </p>

        <h2> <a name="ernst"></a>Charles F. Ernst (1886 - 1968) </h2>
            <p>Charles F. Ernst was the first director of the Washington State Emergency Relief Administration ( SERA), which would later be renamed the State Department of Social Security , serving from 1933 to 1938. He was appointed by Governor Clarence D. Martin, a conservative Democrat, and the two shared the belief that many of the unemployed were able-bodied men and women not trying hard enough to find jobs. Acting on this stern view, Ernst kept a close watch on relief services and came under a lot of criticism from organizations supporting the unemployed during the Great Depression. 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggleview('moreernst');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="moreernst" style="display:none;">
          <p>Charles F. Ernst was born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts in 1886. He attended Harvard University and worked as a social worker in Boston for eight years. He then worked for the Hood Rubber Company, who transferred him to Seattle in 1927. In 1931, two years into the Great Depression, he began working for the Mayor's Committee for Unemployment Relief. On January 1933, Governor Martin chose the former social worker to lead the newly developed SERA. SERA was responsible for organizing public works employment and relief services for the unemployed and Ernst initially established a voucher system, allowing the unemployed or impoverished families to buy supplies and food at the stores with coupons issued by the state. SERA also made sure that all Washington counties received similar and equal relief funding. However, since Ernst was worried about cheaters and determined to force all those who could work to look for jobs, the SERA began checking up on families on relief to make sure they qualified under their rules. As a result, in the first six weeks, 20,000 relief recipients lost benefits. </p>
            <p>Both Governor Martin and Ernst did not approve of unemployment relief and instead placed funds toward social security, insisting it was the family's, rather than the governments, responsibility to pull out of unemployment. This led him to cut back on federal work relief funds in 1937 and cut off 24,000 Washington citizens on relief by 1938, the same years when Washington was in a recession. All of these cutbacks drew tension statewide but Ernst kept firm in his beliefs and agency’s rules. </p>
            <p>Ernst, for the most part, ignored the deepening unemployment problem and concentrated on other kinds of social services, including child welfare and old-age pension. The Social Security Act was passed in August 1935 and for the most part, did not deal with the chronic unemployment problem that was overwhelming during the Great Depression. Two months after the Social Security Act passed, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was established, a New Deal program that employed workers for state work. Ernest was in charge of the hiring process of the WPA and although the WPA did hire thousands in its first year, there were many still without jobs. However, Washington fared better than most states on behalf of the WPA program in the state. </p>
            <p>In 1939, Ernst formally resigned from his position as Social Security director and accepted a job with the American Public Welfare Association. He later worked for the American Red Cross, War Relocation Authority, and other various social services positions until his retirement in 1953. On July 29, 1968 Charles F. Ernst passed away from a heart attack. -- Jiwon Amy Yoo</p>

			<p> <img src="images/whos_who/farquharson.jpg" width="115" height="120" class= leftsmall> Mary Farquharson, Senator of  Washington State from 1935-1941, was a fierce advocate for social justice and  peace. She was involved in several organizations including the ACLU, the  Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, and the Fellowship of Reconciliation.  During her time as Senator she fought to end racial discrimination, improve  education and secure fair employment practices, especially for women. Born Mary Ulanah Nichols on  April 5, 1901 in Tacoma, Washington, she studied at the University of  Washington and received a degree in English in 1925 (Farquharson). During her time at the UW she met Frederick  Farquharson, a professor of Civil Engineering.

            </p>
  <p>          In 1934, encouraged by fellow feminists, Mary ran for public office as a  Democrat (Farquharson). She won a seat in  the Washington State Senate serving the 46th district. Farquharson’s  husband shared her same passion for political and economic reform and in 1935  the two helped to establish the Washington Commonwealth Federation which was  dedicated to improving economic and political conditions through organized  labor and the Democratic Party. Farquharson helped to establish the local  affiliate of the ACLU in Seattle and she was active in the non-sectarian Church  of the People which advocated peace and social justice (Farquharson). </P>
	<p>		  As WWII drew closer both Mrs.  Farquharson and her husband became involved in the peace movement, working as  members of the Fellowship of Reconciliation as well as the National Council for  the Prevention of War. Farquharson was a staunch defender of the rights of  Japanese Americans who were interred in Washington State. Specifically, she  fought for Gordon Kiyoshi Hirabayashi, an American of Japanese descent, who  defied the government interment order and curfew  (Barber). Farquharson was instrumental in obtaining legal representation  for Gordon Hirabayashi from the ACLU. His case went all the way to the Supreme  Court where it was eventually lost but Former Senator Farquharson, along with  the ACLU, supported him the entire time (Eisenburg). </p>
		<p>	  After WWII Mrs. Farquharson  helped to promote humanitarian aid in Europe. Up until her death she was  involved in a number of causes relating to peace and other issues she  considered to be worth fighting including ending the nuclear arms race as well  as the death penalty (Farquharson). Mary  Farquharson passed away in 1982.n -- Christopher Smith</p>

          <p><img src="images/whos_who/hartley.jpg" width="92" height="120" class= leftsmall>Roland Hill Hartley served as  mayor of Everett, Washington from  1910 to 1911 and as governor of Washington State from  1924 to 1932. An influential politician and conservative businessman, Hartley  clashed politically with those involved in education, lumber and the labor  movement. He staunchly opposed what he considered to be excessive government  spending, including welfare and higher education. His term as governor of Washington was  marked most notably by his dismissal of University of Washington  president Henry Suzzallo, who refused to accept Hartley’s attempts to cut  funding to the university. In 1926, just two years into his governorship, there  was a petition to recall Hartley from office, mainly as a result of the firing  of Henry Suzzallo, but insufficient signatures were received to move the recall  forward. 
          <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morehartley');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="morehartley" style="display:none;">
          </p><p>Born on June 26, 1864 in New    Brunswick, Canada,  Roland Hill Hartley was 1 of 12 children. At age 13 he left home to find work and  after his father died the family moved to Minnesota (Riddle). He held many jobs as a young man but  specifically his time working as a personal secretary for Minnesota Governor  David Marston Clough changed the course of his life. Hartley married Clough’s  daughter, Nina, in 1888 and by 1902 the entire family, including their two  sons, had moved to Everett in  order to pursue interests in the lumber industry. Their third child, a  daughter, was born in Everett (Riddle). <br>
          <p>The Hartley and Cough families  enjoyed success in timber business. After the 1906 San    Francisco earthquake timber prices rose  dramatically and Hartley found even greater wealth. At this time, however, he  chose to pursue a career in politics and in 1909 ran for the office of mayor of  Everett.  Hartley stayed for just one term. After a brief stint as state legislator from  1915 to 1916, he decided to run for governor. In both 1916 and 1920 Hartley ran  for the position and lost. In 1924, however, the incumbent, Louis F. Hart did  not pursue the office as a result of failing health and his likely successor  chose not to enter the race (Riddle).  Hartley, therefore, had no completion and took the office of governor. <br>
          <p>Between 1924 and 1932 Hartley  struggled to defeat the eight-hour workday, an anti-child-labor movement, and  to cut spending in the state’s universities. His minimalist government approach  did not sit well with many constituents especially as the Great Depression set  in. Hartley said, “What we need is to…stop this indiscriminate spending of  money in so-called charity and welfare work” (Seattle P.I., May, 6, 1925). He  believed children were too “petted, pampered” and “educated at the expense of  the state” (Seattle P.I., May, 5, 1925).   His battle with Henry Suzzallo came to an end when Hartley removed two  members of the board of regents at the university and subsequently fired three  more, replacing them with appointees loyal to him. The Seattle Times called it  “a ruthless exercise in executive power” (Hartley).  Finally, the board fired Suzzallo in 1926. That same year the Seattle labor  council published a telegram from the American Federation of Labor urging the  recall of Hartley due to his anti-labor record (Hartley).<br>
          <p>Political support for Hartley  diminished greatly in the early 1930s and his run for governor in 1932 as well  as 1936 resulted in defeat. Hartley retired and spent the rest of his life in  Everett passing away on September 21, 1952. -- Christopher Smith

In 1932 he moved from New York City to Seattle to serve on a three-member District 12 Communist Party Executive Committee. That same year he helped organize one of the largest demonstrations of unemployed workers in the State's history. In 1933 he was replaced, along with the other two members of the Executive Committee, by a new Executive Secretary, Morris Rappaport. Hutchins stayed in Seattle and retained a Marxist political orientation, although it is unclear whether he remained an official member of the Communist Party.

          <p>In 1940, Hutchins organized a broad coalition of African American community leaders into the Committee for the Defense of Negro Labor's Right to Work at the Boeing Airplant Company (CDNL) to pressure Boeing into complying with FEPC regulations. Due in large measure to Hutchins' work on the CDNL and for Seattle's African American newspaper, The Northwest Enterprise, Boeing hired its first black employees in 1942. The CDNL marked the height of Hutchins' public visibility as a civil rights leader. However, he remained active in struggles for worker rights and racial justice over at least the next thirty years, including the United Black Construction Workers' efforts to integrate the Seattle Building Trades Unions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. –Daren Salter </p>

Jackson was the first executive secretary of the Seattle Urban League, which  was founded in 1930.  He also established  the African American branch of the Unemployed Citizens’ League during the start  of the Great Depression in 1931 and was the first to organize statistical  studies of Seattle’s African American  community.  
            Jackson graduated from Livingston College in Salisbury, North Carolina in the summer of 1928 and that  following fall, he enrolled the New York School of Social Work with a  fellowship awarded to him by the National Urban League.  He worked at Brooklyn Urban League briefly  before leaving New York to fill Seattle Urban League’s  position in 1930.

        <div id="morejackson" style="display:none;">
            <p>He attended the University of Washington for his graduate studies in  sociology.  His 1939 thesis for his  Masters degree, titled, <em>The Colored Marine Employees Benevolent Association  of the Pacific 1921-1934 or Implications of Vertical Mobility for Negro  Stewards in Seattle</em>, was an implication that Jackson was quite active in  the early civil rights movement in Seattle.   The thesis focused on the importance of the black employment as stewards  and their labor union during the indicated years.  
            <p>Although the African  American community in Seattle was small compared to other  cities’ population, Jackson’s work in the Seattle Urban League  was much needed.  During Jackson’s first year in Seattle Urban  League he organized the Negro Health Week and Vocational Opportunity  program.  In September 1931, due to the  unfortunate outcomes of the Great Depression, Jackson helped with the founding of the  Unemployed Citizens’ League for African Americans to help with the alarming  unemployment problem among Seattle’s Black workers.  By the third year, Jackson and Seattle Urban  League helped with the building of a secretarial school.  They also held public forums for job  opportunities and voting registration, two important topics in Seattle’s African American community  during the Great Depression.  Taking  notice of the little attention Seattle’s African Americans received, he  started to gather statistical information on their health, education, and  employment for research purposes.  In  1938, he also wrote a booklet for the Seattle Urban League and the title speaks  for itself, “What to tell them; a booklet designed to be of special service to  counselors, guidance workers and agencies, with reference to negro girls and  boys in Seattle; and for the use of students themselves ...” 
            <p>Jackson was also the leading  actor in a theatrical play titled “In Abraham’s Bosom,” which was performed  Seattle Repertory Playhouse in 1933.   Little is known about Jackson’s life before and after  his time with Seattle’s Urban League, which  ended in 1939.  -- Jiwon Amy Yoo</p>

        <h2><a name="jones"></a>Wesley Livsey Jones (1863 - 1932)</h2>
        <p><img src="images/whos_who/jones.jpg" width="82" height="120" class= leftsmall>Wesley L. Jones  was a Republican Congressman and U.S. Senator from Washington.   He labeled himself &quot;conservatively progressive&quot; and was a  strong supporter of President Herbert Hoover.   He drafted the Jones Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and became increasingly  involved with the local farmer’s depression in Washington.   He was also a strong advocate of Prohibition, which brought upon him  criticism throughout his political career. Jones was born  on October 9, 1863 in Bethany,   Illinois just days after his father died on a  Civil War battlefield.   Raised by his  mother on a small farm, Jones grew up in a very religious and conservative  home.  He attended Southern Illinois  College, receiving his A.B. degree, then began studying law, passingthe bar in  1886, which is the same year he married Minda Nelson. <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morejones');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="morejones" style="display:none;">
         <p>In  1889, the couple moved to Yakima,   Washington where they stayed until 1917.  He then moved to Seattle and established a law firm with two  friends.  By then, his political career had  already started with the Republican Party. In 1898, Jones  was elected to the House of Representatives, which he stayed for ten years  until he was elected Senator in 1908.  He  would then serve in the Senate for four terms, being re-elected in 1914, 1920,  and 1926.  He also led the Commerce  Committee, allowing Jones to become a powerful leader in the Republican  Party.  Throughout his political career,  he thought of himself as a bridge between the Democratic and Republican Party as  he voted for measures that went against his party, such as funding for  unemployment relief and lower taxation.    Yet, his firm stance with President Hoover during the Great Depression  would become the reason for his -and the Republican Party’s- fall at the 1932  elections.  As Senator, his  work with the Jones Merchant Marine Act of 1920 was widely supported as it protected  American shipping of international goods.   He also realized that the farmers’ votes could help his Party during  elections, so during a farmer’s depression during the 1920s, he coaxed farmers  to vote for his party and tried to aid them.   But he was most known for his support of prohibition of alcohol, which  almost made him lose his election in 1926.    As the Great Depression worsened, the prohibition law became  increasingly unpopular and America began to blame the Republican Party for  the law.   In the 1932 elections, Jones’ association with  the Republican Party and Prohibition made him lose his would-be fifth term as  Senator.  He was replaced with the  liberal Homer T. Bone.        Three weeks  after his loss, Wesley L. Jones died in November 19, 1932 in Seattle, Washington due to his ailing health. -- Jiwon Amy Yoo        </p>

<h2><a name="magnuson"></a>Warren G. Magnuson (1905-1989) <br>
            </h2>
            <p><img src="images/whos_who/magnuson.jpg" width="70" height="120" class= leftsmall>Democratic  Senator from Washington State, Warren G. Magnuson, made legislation  that led to the development and preservation of the United States, Washington State and Seattle. The playboy turned politician used his  gregarious personality, good looks, ambition, intelligence and political savvy  to help raise Washington State from the crisis of the Great Depression.
     Warren G. Magnuson was born on April 12, 1905  in Moorhead,   Minnesota.  Shortly after his birth, William and Emma Magnuson, a local couple, adopted  him. Due to an absence of birth data, certain specifications of his infanthood  are missing (Scates 9). 
  <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('moremagnuson');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="moremagnuson" style="display:none;">
  
  <p>After graduating from Moorhead   High School,  Magnuson attended the University   of North Dakota  and North Dakota   Agricultural   College  before moving to Seattle  to attend the University  of Washington and pursue his high school sweetheart, Loretta Welsh (Scates 17).<br>
<p>Magnuson  enrolled at the University of Washington in October of 1925.&nbsp; After  completing his undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, he was accepted into the School of Law. While attending law school, he  began his political career by campaigning across Washington for Democratic candidate, and Magnuson’s  mentor, A. Scott Bullitt. During the summer of 1928,  Magnuson married his first wife Eleanor Peggy Maddieux. In 1929, Magnuson graduated and was accepted to  the bar the same year. Soon after graduation, Magnuson was offered a job as the  secretary of the Seattle Municipal League (Scates 29). This  position allowed him to establish “…enduring contact with the city’s movers and  shakers… (Scates 31)”<br>
          <p>In 1932, Magnuson left the Seattle Municipal  League to become a special  prosecutor for King County. Soon after, he ran for  office and won a seat as a  state legislator in Seattle. In 1933, Washingtonians called for  relief by staging hunger marches to the capital. Still in the midst of the  Great Depression, unemployment in Washington State was climbing higher and citizens called  for unemployment insurance to alleviate the hardships created by the  Depression. Magnuson saw the necessity of the legislation and gave a convincing  argument to the legislature. Due in part to Magnuson’s moving speech, one of  the first national relief acts for the unemployed was passed. The bill created  a ten million dollar bond issue to hire unemployed workers on public works  projects. Part of the relief act included the Grand Coulee Dam project. In an  attempt to recover the Northwest from depression, Magnuson and other  legislators called for the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. The construction  of the dam created jobs for the unemployed and provided inexpensive electricity.  In addition to the Grand Coulee,  the unemployment relief act went towards the Roza irrigation project, the Deception   Pass   Bridge  and Seattle’s  Washington Park Arboretum. These projects “helped shape the modern state  (Scates 38).” That same  year, Magnuson played a key role in the movement to repeal Washington’s prohibition laws.<br>
          <p>Shortly after his term in state politics,  Magnuson filled and empty seat in the U.S. Congress. Magnuson concentrated on  the Naval Affairs Committee and domestic issues for Washington State during his first few years in Congress.  His efforts would result in the increased federal presence in Washington State. Despite his lack of experience, he was  able to get four and a half million dollars “for a new dock at the base and for  the modernization in Bremerton of the aircraft carriers… (Scates 69)”  Magnuson’s ties with Northwest Airlines and Archer Daniels Midland also created  wealth and assistance to the Pacific   Northwest.  Despite Maggie’s connections with the big guys, he continued to keep his  working-class constituents satisfied. In 1940, he voted against deporting Harry  Bridges, the leader of the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union. <br>
          <p>Magnuson’s  legislations continued to enrich the Northwest into the 1940’s. Regardless of  his anti-war position, with Magnuson as middleman, the war business boosted Washington’s economy tremendously (Scates 93). The  purchase of  ten million dollars in ships  from Bremerton Naval Shipyard by the Navy, the sixty million dollar contract Boeing  received from the military and the manufacturing of aluminum through the hydroelectricity  produced by Northwest dams were just a few of the projects involved (Scates  92).<br>
          <p>Just days  after the attack on Pearl   Harbor on December   7, 1941,  Magnuson took a leave of absence from Congress to join the war effort. He  served in the Navy until July 1942 when President Roosevelt ordered all  congressmen to return to their seats. His participation in the war increased  his popularity as a candidate for the Senate.<br>
          <p>In 1944,  Magnuson was elected to the Senate after defeating Republican Harry P. Cain (Magnuson,  Warren G. (1905-1989)).  Throughout his thirty-six-year term in the Senate, Warren G. Magnuson  consistently worked to produce public works projects; he also helped pass legislation  that allocated federal funds for medical research, supported consumer  protection and helped pass the 1964 civil rights bill. His seniority in the Senate  gave way to power within the political structure and allowed Maggie to continue  to make huge strides for Washington State and the nation until his death on May   20, 1989. -- Dana Mason</p>

<h2><a name="martin"></a>Clarence Daniel Martin (1886- 1955)</h2>
            <p>   <img src="images/whos_who/martin.jpg" width="90" height="120" class= leftsmall> Clarence Daniel Martin was Washington   State's eleventh governor from 1933  to 1941.  Elected during the troubled  times of the Great Depression, Martin and the Democratic Party nearly wiped off  the unpopular Republican rule in Washington.   He is significantly known for endorsing  the building of the Grand Coulee Dam, opening up the University   of Washington’s admissions, and for  reformatting the tax system.            
             Martin’s parents, Francies  M. and Philena Martin moved west from Ohio  and settled in Cheney, Washington  where he was born on June 29, 1886.   He graduated from the State   Normal School in Cheney in 1903 and  in 1906 he graduated from the University   of Washington.  After graduation, he returned to Cheney to  help his father with the family's milling business, F.M. Martin Grain and  Milling Company, which he took over as CEO after his father's death in 1925  until 1943.   <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('moremartin');return false;">More...</a></p>
            <div id="moremartin" style="display:none;">
          <p>His political career began in  1915, when Martin was elected into Cheney's city council.  In 1928 he was elected mayor of Cheney and at  the same time, served as the chairman of the State Democratic Committee.  A conservative Democrat, Martin was elected governor  in 1932, ending Roland Hill Hartley’s unpopular rule.  He was elected by “one of the largest popular  votes in the state” defeating Hartley, a conservative Republican, twice in 1932  and again in 1936.  </p>
          <p>Elected during the height of  the Great Depression, Martin's platform included relief for state's unemployed,  rescuing higher education, and tax reform.  Building the Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams provided  jobs and electricity.  He lowered the  requirements of admissions and tuition for the University   of Washington, which opened the  doors to more students..  Martin also presided  over the reorganization of the state’s tax system, placing a limit on property  taxes and instituting a sales tax.  Other  programs he helped establish were the State Planning Council and an Emergency  Relief Administration, </p>
          <p>Although Martin was  well-received by the public, he did not get along with the labor movement in Seattle.  Seemingly conservative, he helped defeat a  1935 bill for public welfare which disappointed liberals and labor unions, such  as the Unemployed Citizens League.   However, they could not stop Martin from getting re-elected in  1936.  His second term was filled with  challenges like the <em>Seattle</em><em>’s P-I strike,</em> the first successful  strike by professional journalists.   Martin opposed calling in the National Guard, not wanting to repeat his  previous mistakes with earlier labor strikes, which strengthened his image with  the State Federation of Labor.  Yet, his  third attempt for governor failed in 1940 as he lost to Senator C.C. Dill in  the primary election.  </p>
          <p>In 1944, Martin served a  session in the state House of Representatives, filling in a vacant spot.  His last political position was for Cheney  City Council when he was re-elected in 1950.   Martin also worked as the director of the American Bank of Spokane  and the Seattle First National Bank, which he left in April of 1955 due to his  failing health.  On August 11, 1955 Clarence Daniel Martin died at  the age of sixty-nine.  </p>

            <h2><a name=mcmahon></a>Theresa McMahon (1878-1961)</h2>
            <p>Theresa Schmid McMahon, a professor at  the University of Washington and noted liberal, made great  advancements for women and the working-class. McMahon worked for unionization,  collective bargaining, an eight-hour workday, a minimum wage law and an overall  progression in the standard of living for citizens. She was an important person in Washington State, Seattle and the University of Washington.
            Theresa Schmid was born on April   29, 1878 in Tacoma, Washington. Although she moved out of Washington State several times to pursue her education,  she would ultimately return to Seattle. At the age of sixteen she enrolled at  the University of Washington (McMahon 1). During her Undergraduate  career at the University, McMahon met her future husband and life-long friend,  Edward McMahon (McMahon 2).
            <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('moremcmahon');return false;">More...</a></p>
            <div id="moremcmahon" style="display:none;">
            <p>            It was during this time that Theresa was introduced  to the social sciences by her professor, Dr. J. Allen Smith. During her time  with Dr. Smith, Theresa learned about the “injustice that occurred in the  industrial field: the exploitation of common resources by the few and the  exploitation of the workers… (McMahon 9)” <br>
            <p>After graduating with a Bachelors of Arts  degree in 1899, she began teaching at a nearby school. While teaching she  married Edward McMahon.  In 1906, the  couple moved to Milwaukee to pursue their doctorates at the University of Wisconsin; Theresa graduated with her doctorates  degree in 1909 (Gottfried 41). Shortly after graduation, she accepted a  position as a social worker at Hull House. Her work at Hull House, in addition  to her job as a statistician at The Associate Charities of Chicago, introduced  her to the struggles of the poor (McMahon 15). As McMahon discusses in her  memoir, <em>My Story</em>, “…this experience  stood me in good stead when it came to interpreting the labor problems of the  country (18).” <br>
            <p>In 1911, the McMahons returned to Seattle. Despite the sexism found within  educational institutions at the time, Dr. J Allen Smith offered Theresa a  position in the economics department (Gottfried 41). She excitedly accepted the  offer and began teaching elementary economics. Later, she added classes in  labor history and legislation, ideas she was passionate and informed about  (McMahon 20). As an adamant reformer, Theresa lobbied for an employer liability  law and an eight-hour workday (McMahon 23). In addition, she was appointed as a  member of the Minimum Wage Board, a commission that would “determine what a  minimum wage should be and to see that it was enforced (McMahon 26).” Her  participation in the labor movement caused problems at the University. On  several occasions, there were threats to fire the McMahons, Smith and other  professors involved in the labor movement (McMahon 24, 26). Luckily, Theresa  escaped expulsion. <br>
            <p>In addition to the general labor  movement, McMahon put forth a great amount of effort to advocate for working  women’s rights (Gottfried 58). Theresa “…had a long-standing, continuous  concern over the status of women (Gottfried 57)”; she was part of a small number  of women in the field of economics and refused to accept or conform to mainstream  gender standards.  She often wrote  analyses about the relationship of women and economics and McMahon may have  been the first person at the University of Washington to introduce a course in the study of  women. <br>
            <p>McMahon’s support of women’s rights was  not limited to education as she was an active participant in political movements  as well. Theresa worked to obtain an eight-hour workday for women and end  sexual discrimination in employment. When the public was invited to a hearing  being held by the Senate and the House, she rushed to Olympia to “save the eight hour workday (McMahon  25).” Theresa and other female professors at the University had experienced  discrimination based on sex during several occasions, the most prominent being  the inclusion of the “nepotism rule” which acted to eliminate wedded women from  the workplace (Gottfried 59). The rule was put in place shortly after McMahon  retired in 1937; however, when a married female professor was fired, Theresa  went to the National Association of University Instructors to ask for an  investigation. After her retirement McMahon continued to serve other causes  like social security reform. <br>
            <p>McMahon passed away on June   27, 1961 at the  age of 83. The fearless radical would not be forgotten. Her commitment to  workers rights has been ingrained in one of Seattle’s landmarks, the University of Washington. A residence hall has been named to  commemorate her achievements and dedication.  -- Dana Mason</p>

<h2><a name="ross"></a>James  Delmage Ross (1872–1939)</h2>
<p><img src="images/whos_who/ross-2.jpg" width="80" height="120" class= leftsmall>James  Delmage Ross (JD Ross) was the second superintendent for Seattle City Light, a  public-owned electricity company which started in 1905.  He helped with the building of the Cedar River’s power plant and the  dam projects on the Skagit River.  He is best known for his support of public  power in Western Washington.  
Ross was  born in Chatham, Ontario on November   9, 1872.  He graduated from Chatham Collegiate  Institute in 1891 and taught for the next six years.  In 1898, he ventured up to Alaska for the Klondike Gold  Rush, but found no luck in the gold fields.   He then ended up in Seattle in 1902 and established  a small electrical contracting firm that did not fare well.  He ended up closing his business but found an  engineering job with the City of Seattle in January 1903.

            <div id="moreross" style="display:none;"></p>
            </p>
<p>Before the  Great Depression, many of the power companies were privately-owned.  This led to many political debates on public  vs. private power companies and Ross a primary promoter for public power.  When the Cedar Falls project was proposed  and approved by voters in 1902, Ross was hired to design the new power  plant.  </p>
<p>The City  of Seattle established a new  department for light and power in 1910 and named it Seattle City Light, of which  Ross became superintendent after the original superintendent redesigned just a  year later.  Ross’ most influential  project soon got under way when he proposed to build three dams on the Skagit River.  This way power could be readily available and  affordable in Seattle and its neighboring towns.  However, a private company from Boston called Stone and Webster  already had set their sights on Skagit River.  After years of legal battling, the Secretary  of Agriculture David F. Houston gave permission to Seattle City Light to build  the dams on Skagit River in 1917.  Even with the construction of the dams  underway, the debate and political controversy of public vs. private continued,  with Ross in the middle of it all.  Seattle’s Mayor Frank Edwards  fired Ross on March 1931, which led many to believe that Edwards was working  with Stone and Webster.  After a  successful protest to recall Mayor Edwards from office, Ross was re-hired for  Seattle City Light.</p>
<p>The  building of the dams proved to be quite successful as the number of Seattle  City Light’s customers from 1917 to 1932 more than doubled.  Satisfied with the coverage and affordability  of Seattle City Light’s services, Seattle’s voters greatly  respected Ross.  He continued working for  Seattle City Light until the time of his death in 1939.  Ross Dam and Ross Lake were named in his  honor.  -- Jiwon Amy Yoo</p>

           <h2><a name="roundtree"></a>Orville Roundtree (1896-1972)</h2>
<p>Orville Roundtree was the Washington state organizer for the Silver Legion of America a Depression era fascist organization. His work as an organizer would result in one of the largest chapters of the “Silver Shirts” and the spread of fascism throughout the Northwest. 

In 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, William Dudley Pelley founded the Silver Shirts. The Silver Shirts, also known as the Silver Legion of America or the Silver Shirt Legion of America, was an infamous fascist organization affiliated with the Christian Party. They were both a political and spiritual organization, and Pelley, their founder and leader, preached he had supernatural powers. The organization hoped to recover America from Soviet influence and develop a new Christian government. The national and state leaders, like Orville Roundtree, overtly supported Hitler and promoted white supremacy, and the organization grew to fifteen thousand members in 1934. (OlyBlog)

<p>In 1935, Pelley announced he was running for president. Despite his efforts, his name only showed up on Washington State’s presidential ballot. Pelley hired Orville Roundtree as campaign organizer. Roundtree lived in Chehalis, Washington a small city ninety miles outside of Seattle. At the time of his appointment, Orville Roundtree was an insurance salesman although he had a history in politics. His political career had not been successful; he lost the campaign for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 1932 as a Democrat, and lost again in 1934 under the Liberty Party (OlyBlog). He had planned to run for office again under the Christian Party before he was recruited as Pelley’s state organizer. The Silver Shirts were unsuccessful in capturing the popular vote in Washington and the organization was short-lived. After the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war on fascist Nazi Germany and Italy, the Silver Legion of America disintegrated. -- Dana Mason</p>

            <p><img src="images/whos_who/sakamoto.jpg" width="110" height="120" class= leftsmall>James  Yoshino Sakamoto, known as Jimmy Sakamoto, was the editor and founder of <em>Japanese American Courier </em>and the second  president of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL).  Sakamoto was born in 1903 in Seattle, Washington to parents Osamu and  Tsuchi Sakamoto as the youngest of three children. 
            In  1920 Sakamoto graduated from Franklin High School in Seattle and helped established  Seattle Progressive Citizens’ League the following year.  In 1923 he moved to the East Coast to live with his older sister, where he became a  professional welterweight prize fighter.   He began taking seminary classes in Princeton University, found a job with New York’s <em>Japanese American Daily News</em> as their English editor and continued fighting on the side.  
            <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('moresakamoto');return false;">More...</a></p>
            <div id="moresakamoto" style="display:none;"></p>
     <p>       By 1926 he was turning blind because of  eye injuries due to his fighting, and by 1927 he was widowed by his first wife  and permanently blind.  He left New York and his baby daughter at his in-laws and headed for Seattle (Tsutakawa 22).  Yet, his handicap did not stop him from  establishing Seattle’s first English language Japanese newspaper, the <em>Japanese American Courier</em> in 1928 at the age of 25 (Taylor 119).  His second wife, Sisao Nishitani, would  become the business manager of his newspaper (Tsutakawa 24). </p>
           <p>The <em>Japanese American Courier </em> faced  challenges in its first year. Then when the Depression came to Seattle in 1930, the newspaper  nearly ended as local banks and businesses, which supported the paper, were  closing down (Tsutakawa 31).  The decline  of financial support was also linked to the decline of the Japanese population  in Seattle, which dropped down 21 percent during the 1930s (Taylor 127), largely due to the fact that the educated and English-speaking Issei (first generation)  could not find adequate jobs in America.  Many left for Japan, which came as a  hardship to Sakamoto as many were his colleagues and the newspaper’s financial  support.  To make ends meet, Sakamoto had  to network outside the Nisei (second generation) community and made ties with  white professionals and scholars to keep the paper going.  </p>
           <p>From  1936 to 1938, Sakamoto became the second national president of the JACL and  encouraged the Nisei to learn more about American  politics, especially voting.  Two  important legal victories for the JACL and the Japanese-American Seattle  community during the 1930s were the amendment of the Cable Act, which allowed  American-born Japanese woman to keep their citizenship if they married a  non-citizen, and the passage of the Veteran’s Bill, which granted citizenship to Japanese-American World War I veterans. (Tsutakawa 43). </p>
           <p>Once  America entered World War II,  Sakamoto and his family were placed into a concentration camp in Minidoka, Idaho, along with 13,000  Japanese-Americans from Washington State.  The relocation of Sakamoto's family ended his JACL career and the <em>Japanese American  Courier</em>.  He left the camp in July  1945. </p>
           <p>After  the war, Sakamoto found work in the Solicitation Department of St. Vincent de  Paul but on his way to work early one December morning, he was hit by a passing  car.  James Yoshino Sakamoto died on his  way to the hospital at the age of 52. -- Jiwon Amy Yoo</p>

            <h2><a name="schwellenbach"></a>Lewis Baxter  Schwellenbach (1894-1948)</h2>
            <p><img src="images/whos_who/schwellenbach.jpg" width="85" height="120" class= leftsmall>Lewis B.  Schwellenbach was a politician from Washington State, having served all three branches of the  federal government as a senator from 1935 to 1940, a judge from 1940 to 1945,  and was the Secretary of Labor from 1945 to 1948.  As a liberal Democratic and a strong  supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, he advocated for public  ownership of water power and was largely against World War II.  
            Schwellenbach  was born in Superior, Wisconsin but always considered Washington his home given that he lived in Spokane since he was seven years old.  He attended the University of Washington and graduated from its law school in  1917.  He served in the Army during World  War I and upon his return was admitted to the bar in 1919.  He then opened a law practice in Seattle that largely represented organized labor.

            <div id="moreschwellenbach" style="display:none;"></p></p>
            <p>Schwellenbach became  the King County Democratic Party chairman, allowing many to think he had a sure  chance of winning the 1932 elections for governor.  He ran against liberal William Pemberton and  conservative Clarence D. Martin, focusing on the failing economy and  recommending tax reduction.  However,  Schwellenbach lost in the Democratic primaries and Martin became governor of Washington.  </p>
            <p>The 1932 elections  did not stop Schwellenbach’s political career as he was elected to the U.S.  Senate in 1934, a position that allowed him to become close friends with the  future President Harry Truman.  As  Senator, he continually advocated for public power and supported all of Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, including Roosevelt’s controversial plan to increase the number  of justices on the Supreme Court.  Much of  the legislation he was involved with was important to Washington’s economy, including bills concerning  the fishing and lumber industries, which were Washington’s two most highest income sources.  He was also a strong believer in world peace  and even made a trip to Europe in 1938, where he unsuccessfully tried  to organize an international conference to ensure world peace.  Although the war could not be avoided,  Schwellenbach continued to advocate world peace and passionately defended the  Neutrality Law.  </p>
            <p>On December  1940, Schwellenbach officially resigned as Senator to become federal district  judge in Spokane, a career he was most passionate about.  After World War II and the death of President  Roosevelt, Truman urged Schwellenbach to accept the position as U.S. Secretary  of Labor, which he did in 1945.  However,  an injury in 1946 caused Schwellenbach to decrease his activities as Secretary  of Labor.  As his health weakened,  Schwellenbach was admitted to the hospital in May of 1948.  Two months later on June 10, 1948, Lewis B. Schwellenbach died from a  cardiac arrest.  -- Jiwon Amy Yoo</p>

              <p><img src="images/whos_who/sieg.jpg" width="80" height="120" class= leftsmall>Lee Paul Sieg was the President of the University of  Washington, Seattle from 1934 to 1946.   During his time as President, he was responsible for several changes in  the university’s curriculum and politics.   One of them was the establishment of the University College, the unified  College for liberal arts and sciences under Dean Edward Lauer. Sieg was born in Marshalltown, Iowa on October 7, 1879.  He attended the University of Iowa and  received his Masters in Physics there in 1901 and his Doctorate degree in  Philosophy in 1910.  Before coming to the  University of Washington, Sieg held several leadership and teaching positions  in various colleges.  He was the head of  the Physics Department at Carleton College in Minnesota from 1903 to 1906.   In 1906 to 1924, he was a professor at the  University of Iowa.  He then made a  respectable reputation for himself at the University of Pittsburgh as the Dean  of the college, the Dean of the School of Education, and the Dean of the  Graduate School from 1924 to 1934.

              </p>
 <p>             Sieg was well known and respected for his work at the  University of Pittsburgh.  When the University of Washington needed  to hire a new President during the start of the Great Depression crisis, Sieg  was nominated to help pull the university through.  Sieg accepted the position on June 1, 1934  and even asked for a temporary reduction in his salary since the university and  the state had gone through numerous budget cuts before 1934.  Sieg also accepted a proposal in 1934 from  the Instructors Association, an organization for the university’s faculty  members and assistants.   The proposal  included many benefits for the faculty members, which were non-existent before  Sieg became President.  That included the  elections of a faculty Senate, better pay, retirement, and tenures.  </p>
          <p>    However, some of his views were unpopular amongst his  students and faculty.  He voiced his  opposition against student-led political activities and warned his students  against communist influence.   He also  did not approve of the “nepotism” at the university and eliminated as many  female faculty members as possible if they were married to another faculty  member.  When he retired from his position  in 1946 he was the first to be named president emeritus at the University of Washington. </p>
<p>              Sieg died on October 8, 1963 in Seattle, Washington at the  age of 84. -- Jiwon Amy Yoo</p>

              Lowell Wakefield was the founder and editor of the <em>Voice of Action</em>, the unofficial newspaper of the Northwest Communist Party from 1933-1936. A Washington State native, he briefly attended the UW, but was expelled for leading a student movement against the UW's compulsory ROTC policy. He then journeyed to the Tennessee where he became the first southern organizer of the International Labor Defense, the legal arm of the Communist Party USA. It was in this capacity that he broke the story of the Scottsboro Nine in Alabama in 1931. Wakefield's initial reports were critical in drawing the ILD and the Communist Party's attention to the case, which went on to become one of the most celebrated civil rights campaigns of the twentieth century.

        <div id="morewakefield" style="display:none;"> 
</p><p>Wakefield returned to Seattle in 1932 to serve on a three-member District 12 Executive Committee along with Hutchin R. Hutchins and Alan Max and to organize a Northwest branch of the ILD. In 1934 he ran unsuccessfully for the State Legislature on the Communist Party ticket. After the Voice of Action was subsumed under the WCF's Sunday News, Wakefield became a correspondent for the Daily Worker. In 1938 he was a Daily Worker correspondent for the trials of Nazi espionage agents in the United States and published a book on the events titled <em>Hitler's Spy Ploy in the USA</em>. </p>
            <p> Wakefield underwent a remarkable reinvention after World War II. In 1946 he founded Deep Sea Trawlers, later renamed Wakefield Seafoods, a small fishing and canning company specializing in what was then a relatively unknown commodity – Alaskan King Crab. By 1955 Wakefield Seafoods was producing 85 percent of the total King Crab catch for American consumers. Wakefield is widely credited with being the founder of the modern king crab industry and pioneering many of its most important advances. –Daren Salter</p>

Wallgren served in the United States Congress from 1933 to 1941, was a U.S. Senator from 1941 to 1945, and was governor of Washington State from 1945 to 1949.  As Congressman, he advocated for state tourism by introducing the bill to establish Olympic National Park, which was approved in 1936.  His greatest claim to fame would come during his term as governor with the 1945 Unemployment Compensation Act.  Wallgren was born on April 17, 1891 in Des Moines, Iowa.  His family moved to Washington when he was ten years old.  He attended Business College in Everett and graduated Washington State School of Optometry in Spokane in 1914.  That same year, he married Mabel C. Liberty.  During World War I, he served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Coast Artillery, as well as the National Guard.  
<a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morewallgren');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="morewallgren" style="display:none;">
<p>Wallgren's political career started as member of the U.S. House of Representative from 1933-1940; his biggest project being the development of the Olympic National Park, which he believed would help Washington's economy by bringing in state tourism.  He served in the Senate from 1941 to 1944, which coincided with the Pearl Harbor attack and the United States entrance to World War II.  After Pearl Harbor, a committee was organized to deal with the "Japanese Problem" in the Pacific Coast, with Wallgren serving as chairman.  As head of the committee, he helped plan the internment of Japanese Americans in Washington in 1942. 

<P>As the war ended in 1945, Wallgren was elected as Washington state governor, an office he held until 1949.  In his inaugural speech, he stressed the need to improve Washington's economy, worried that the end of the war might mean escalating joblessness and a return to Great Depression problems.  He pushed for the state to open up more jobs for the unemployed as well as encouraging unemployment compensation payments and sickness benefits, which was granted in the 1945 Unemployment Compensation Act.  His term as governor saw the economy improve.  In April of 1946, the state counted 120,000 unemployed. The number fell to 70,000 within a few months.  

<p>Wallgren tried to run for a second term as governor but was defeated by former governor Arthur Langlie.  Wallgren’s term as governor was marked by the end of the war and an improved economy.  He then went on to serve in the Federal Power Commission for two years, retiring from politics in 1951.

            <p>When the Great Depression struck Washington State, the black community saw a rapid decline  in wealth, employment and civil rights. William H. Wilson worked to improve the  civil rights of African Americans through his editorship of the business paper, <em>Northwest   Enterprise</em> and as a leader of the NAACP.  He founded the <em>Northwest Enterprise,</em> in 1920  (<em>The Northwest Enterprise</em>,  HistoryLink) which would quickly become the  most popular and successful African American paper in Seattle (Taylor 72).  The  paper circulated outside of the city as well and was “expanded…beyond black Seattle to a regional market  (Taylor 72).” <em>Northwest Enterprise</em> established itslef as the  voice of African Americans in the Northwest.

<p>This outlet proved extremely  important for the black community during the Great Depression. When the  depression began, African Americans saw increased competition in the workforce  from other races (Taylor 64). Despite the intensified race relations, Wilson urged businesses to  refrain from limiting their consumers to African Americans. Wilson did not only believe  in the social and political emancipation of blacks, but of all races. As editor  of <em>Northwest Enterprise</em>, Wilson used his position in  the media to help increase black employment, minimize racism and segregation  and strengthen and unify the black community. -- Dana Mason and Jiwon Amy Yoo

<p> <img src="images/whos_who/zionchecks large.jpg" width="140" height="120" class= leftsmall>On August 7, 1936, while waiting in their car, Rubye Louise Nix watched her husband, Marion Zioncheck fall to his death from the 5 th story window of the Arctic Building on 3 rd Ave and Cherry St in Seattle. The suicide note found after his death read, “My only hope in life was to improve the condition of an unfair economic system that held no promise to those that all the wealth of even a decent chance to survive let alone live” (Seattle Star, August 8, 1936). Although in part unintelligible, Zioncheck clearly strove to help those who he believed to be taken advantage of by the political and economic system of the Great Depression. <a href="#" onclick="toggleview('morezioncheck');return false;">More...</a></p>        
        <div id="morezioncheck" style="display:none;"> 
	    <p> A progressive Democrat and passionate supporter of President Roosevelt’s New Deal, Marion Zioncheck served as Congressman for Washington’s 1 st congressional district from 1933 to 1936. He championed the plight of the average worker declaring he would not endorse the aims of banks or powerful corporations when they conflicted with those of the working man (Zioncheck). </p>
            <p> Born M. Antoni Zajaczek on December 5, 1900, in Poland, Zioncheck moved to the United States with his family at age 3. He attended the University of Washington in 1919 but had to drop out due to a lack of funds. Zioncheck began working in logging camps as a rigger and timber faller. He eventually saved enough money to return to the UW and earned a degree in law in 1928. In 1929 he was accepted to the bar and began practicing. </p>
            <p> Zioncheck made a name for himself as a lawyer who fought for the destitute and underrepresented, including unemployed workers, radicals, and labor union figures, often working pro bono. In 1931, Zioncheck fought with Seattle Mayor Frank Edwards over the privatization of Seattle City Light which resulted in Edward’s recall and the reinstatement of Superintendent J.D. Ross. Customer rates dropped 75% as a result and Zioncheck found himself a local hero in Seattle (Fraser). With the momentum of this victory, Marion Zioncheck ran for Congress in 1932 and won. His time in Congress was marked by his efforts to fervently promote FDR’s New Deal policy, which he believed even the president did not push far enough. He also struggled to find work for those unemployed during the Great Depression in Seattle. Zioncheck became well known, however, when his off-duty activities made national headlines, including driving across the White House lawn in his own car. </p>
            <p> Depression set in for Zioncheck and he was admitted to a psychiatry ward but stayed only a short time. Upon his release he mentioned to his trusted friend King County Prosecutor Warren G. Magnuson he might not seek reelection ( Crowley). Magnuson promptly filed for his congressional seat which may have been the final straw for Zioncheck. The next day, August 7, 1936, Marion Zioncheck leaped to his death from the 5 th story of the Arctic building. -- Christopher Smith</p>
