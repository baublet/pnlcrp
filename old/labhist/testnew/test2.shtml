			<p>Far from Wall Street, Washington residents were slow to react to the events of October 1929. As the stock market tumbled, the <em>Seattle Times</em> reassured readers in a big headline that there would be &quot;No Depression.&quot;<A title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</A> </span>Indeed, job losses were modest for the first year. But the optimism faded toward the end of 1930 as banks began to fail, stores closed, and unemployment surged. </p>
            <p>Policy makers then managed to make things worse. In the nation's capital, President Herbert Hoover presided over a series of decisions that accelerated and globalized the economic decline. In Olympia, the state legislature, meeting early in 1931, passed a bill to help the unemployed and stimulate the economy with an ambitious program of public works projects. They also passed a state income tax to take some of the burden off property taxes. Governor Roland Hartley vetoed both measures and preceded to slash spending, as did many of the cities and counties. Bank failures, business failures, and job losses accelerated. </p>
            <p>Unemployment rates exceeded the national average but were kept lower than in states like Michigan and Ohio where so many jobs depended on one or two massive industries.  Hardest hit in Washington, as in many states, was the building and construction industry where  payrolls by late 1932  were about 10 percent of what they had been four years earlier. Logging and sawmills saw employment drop by at least 50 percent and payrolls still further. But employment in food processing, the transportation sector, utilities, and road construction held up even at the lowest point of the Depression, and a few smaller industries, notably pulp and paper mills, actually added jobs and expanded payrolls in 1932 and 1933. Overall, it is estimated that total income payments in the state fell by 45 percent by 1933 which was similar to the average decline for the nation as a whole. But at least one third of Washington's labor force was unemployed in early 1933, with still higher rates in Seattle and other cities where the jobless congregated. These rates were higher than the national average, which is thought to have peaked at 25 percent.<A title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</A></span></p>
            <h2>Poverty and homelessness </h2>
           <p><span class="rightcap" style="width:432px;"><a href="../new/hooverville.shtml"><img src="../new/images/hooverville_432.jpg" border="0"></a><br>

		    <p>Since the government provided no  unemployment insurance,  lost jobs quickly translated into lost homes and extreme poverty. In 1931, tent camps and shack towns began to appear. One large encampment that residents called <a href="../new/hooverville.shtml">&quot;Hooverville&quot;</a> --in honor of the President whom they blamed for the Depression--grew in the mudflats south of downtown Seattle near Elliott Bay.  City authorities ordered the site burned  but it was quickly rebuilt, becoming in time a  nearly all-male community of more than one thousand residents. Tolerated by authorities, it remained occupied  until torn down by the city in 1941. </p>
            <p>Until 1933 when federal assistance began, it was up to local authorities to assist impoverished residents. Counties and cities did what they could,  establishing work programs more often than direct relief, but declining tax revenues made it hard to do very much. Churches and charities also helped as more fortunate residents often gave generously to  feed and clothe the poor. </p>
            <p>Founded in mid 1931, the <a href="Unemployed_Citizens_League.shtml">Unemployed Citizen's League</a> demanded more funds and different kinds of programs for the unemployed and forced city officials to leave Hooverville alone. With clubs in most neighborhoods of Seattle and Tacoma and several other cities, the UCL advocated self-help production, setting up cooperatives to exchange products and services. Farmers donated  food  in exchange for labor; carpenters, dentists, and seamstresses exchanged one kind of skill for another. In Seattle UCL was so popular and powerful that the city's relief office used it to distribute public resources to the poor. For two years, as the economy went from bad to worse, the UCL helped some of the unemployed maintain themselves.</p>
            <h2>Recovery, 1933-1937 </h2>
            <p>When Franklin Roosevelt assumed office in March 1933, the economy was nearly stalled. Congress quickly passed a sequence of emergency measures to rescue the banking system, send  emergency aid to the states, and begin to re-employ the millions who were out of work. Federal funds to Washington State were  funneled through the Washington Emergency Relief Administration, a state agency that dispersed some money directly to the poor in the form of cash grants while also launching dozens of public works projects that created new jobs. Soon there would be more jobs coordinated with federal agencies. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) would employ thousands of young men in the forests and national parks of Washington State. The Civil Works Adminstration set up small public works jobs, while the Public Works Administration planned huge new infrastructure projects that included Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams on the Columbia River. In 1935 many of the jobs and construction programs were consolidated under the  Works Progress Administration (WPA).</p>
            <p>With federal help, the state economy began a dramatic recovery, faster than many other states. By 1937, income payments in Washington (our best measure of economic activity) had returned to 93 percent of the 1929 level. Nationally, the level was 88 percent. Employment in the region's key industry, forest products, keyed the recovery. In 1937, there were almost as many workers employed in the woods, sawmills, paper mills, furniture, and wood products factories as in 1929, although wages remained well below normal. Other parts of the economy had rebounded, though not so dramatically, but the recovery was soon thwarted when the over-confident Roosevelt administration cut spending in an effort to balance the federal budget. The national economy and state economies now descended into a second depression, which economists euphemistically labeled a &quot;recession,&quot; coining the term that ever since has been used to describe economic downturns.<A title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</A></p>
            <p>Renewed federal spending  pulled both the state and nation out of the 1937 recession. When census takers collected information about employment in March 1940, the Washington jobless rate stood at 9.9 percent with another 5.3 percent working on WPA and CCC projects. This was close to the national average that month.<A title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</A></p>
            <p>But the days of unemployment were soon to end. With war looming, the federal government needed planes and ships and Washington would build both. The  new electricity generated by Bonneville and other Columbia River dams would power the shipyards of Vancouver and the Puget Sound. Cheap energy  made Seattle into one of the nation's aircraft capitals, as new electricity-hungry aluminum plants  provided what Boeing needed to build America's bomber squadrons. </p>
            <p align="left">By the end of 1942, 150,000 workers labored around the clock in the state's shipyards and aircraft factories. Not only was the Depression a memory, the state was now looking at its new economy, based more on planes than on trees, and firmly rooted in new industries that the federal infrastructure investments of the 1930s had made possible. </p>
