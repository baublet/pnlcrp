		the deeds of tens of thousands of homeowners living in neighborhoods 
		outside of the Central Area and the International District. Look deep in 
		the fine print. </span><font face="Arial" size="2">Many Queen Anne

		Racial deed restrictions became common after 1926 when the U.S. Supreme 
		Court validated their use. The restrictions were an enforceable contract 
		and an owner who violated them risked forfeiting the property.</font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial"> Many neighborhoods prohibited the sale or rental of 
		property by Asian Americans&nbsp;and Jews as well as Blacks. </span>
		<font face="Arial" size="2"> 
		&nbsp;In 1948, the court changed its mind, declaring that racial 
		restrictions would no longer be enforced, but the decision did nothing 
		to alter the informal structures of segregation. It remained perfectly 
		legal for realtors and property owners to discriminate on the basis of 
		race. Only after Congress passed the Housing Rights Act in 1968 were 
		there measurable openings in Seattle's system of housing segregation. <br>

		Below is part of our database of racial restrictive covenants. Combing through 
		the files of the King County Recorder's Office, we have uncovered 416		deeds and covenants containing racial 
		restrictions that apply to scores of neighborhoods in Seattle and the 
		suburbs north, south, and east of the city. This is just a sample of the 
		restrictions that once shaped the housing options for King County 
		residents.</font></p>
		<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
		Look at the list of neighborhoods. North of the ship canal most neighborhoods 
		were restricted, as was Capitol Hill, Madison Park, Queen Anne, and 
		Magnolia. We have found a few&nbsp; restrictive deeds in Beacon Hill and Rainier Valley, more in the lakeside neighborhoods from Madronna to Ranier Beach.  Racial restrictions were still more common in the suburbs.  
		People of color had little chance of finding housing except in the central neighborhoods of 
		Seattle.</font></p>
		<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
		Look also at the language of restriction in these deeds. Some specify 
		that neighborhoods are reserved for &quot;Whites,&quot; while others enumerate the prohibited 
		racial groups. And the wording is curious. In the  terminology 
		of the 1920s-1940s &quot;Hebrews&quot; meant Jews; &quot;Ethiopians&quot; meant African ancestry; 
		&quot;Malays&quot; meant Filipinos. Most shocking is the<strong> <a href="covenants_Aryans.htm">&quot;Aryans only&quot; </a></strong><a href="covenants_Aryans.htm">restriction</a> imposed on a subdivision in Clyde Hill. That racial concept, favored by Adolph Hitler, was written into deeds as late as 1946.</font></p>
		<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
		The simplified database is below. You may also explore the full <a href="covenants_database.htm">database of 416 deeds</a>. Here is how to read the table below. When a neighborhood or subdivision is
		<font color="#800000"><b>highlighted in red,</b></font> it means that we have 
		found multiple copies of a restriction and have reason to believe that 
		it covered all properties in an area. Seattle neighborhoods are followed by Eastside, North King Co, South King Co. and Vashon Island neighborhoods. </font></p>
