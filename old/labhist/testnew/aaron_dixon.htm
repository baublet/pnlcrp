		    <p>Aaron
		        Dixon was co-founder and Captain of the Seattle chapter of the
		    Black Panther Party. </p>
		    <p>Born in Chicago, he grew up in Seattle's Central
		      District. His father worked at Boeing and both parents taught Aaron and
		      his brothers the importance of fighting for social justice.&nbsp; As a
		      college student at the University of Washington, Dixon played a key role
		      in the formation of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the Seattle Chapter of the Student Nonviolent
		      Coordinating Committee (SNCC) along with Larry Gossett and others.&nbsp; Through
		      the BSU, Dixon also helped organize protests and black student
		      unions at local high schools.&nbsp; In the spring of 1968, at the funeral
		      of Bobby Hutton in Oakland, California, Dixon met Bobby Seale
		      and later was appointed Captain of Seattle&rsquo;s Black Panther Party,
		      the first chapter outside of Oakland. He was 19 years old.&nbsp;Dixon
		      led the chapter through its first four years, then moved to Party
		      national headquarters in Oakland in 1972.
		      There he worked with Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, and served
		      for a time as bodyguard to Elaine Brown. </p>
		    <p>Aaron Dixon has written an autobiography
		        and has made two chapters available through the It's About Time
		          website: <a href="http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Chapter_History/pdf/Seattle/Seattle_Chapter_History_1.pdf"> Chapter
		        11: The Panther Emerges</a> (.pdf file)&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Chapter_History/pdf/Seattle/Seattle_Chapter_History_2.pdf"> Chapter
		        12: The Panther Comes to Seattle</a> (.pdf file). </p>
		    <p> Aaron Dixon shared memories of his experiences
		        with the Black Panther Party in videotaped interviews conducted by
		        Janet Jones, Trevor Griffey, and Alex Morrow on May 2 and July 13,&nbsp; 2005.
		        In these wide-ranging interviews, Dixon recalls the
		        tension, violence, and excitement that surrounded the Black Panthers.&nbsp; He
		        also gives a rich account of the day-to-day life of Party members
		        and describes the social programs that the Panthers developed, including
		        a free breakfast program for school children, legal aid and medical
		        clinics, pest control services, and a prison visitation program.&nbsp;</p>
		    <p> To the right are streaming-video excerpts of the
		        interviews, most about a minute in length, in windows media format.
		        A high speed connection is recommended for viewing them. 
            <p> You may also want to read the transcripts
                of an earlier oral history interview.
