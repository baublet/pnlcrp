					Local organizations mobilized to create anti-Japanese 
					propaganda while President Theodore Roosevelt urged caution 
					to prevent insulting the Japanese government.&nbsp; The following 
					years brought the first federal legislation dealing 
					specifically with Japan as well as the controversial 
					“Gentleman’s Agreement”.&nbsp; During World War I immigration 
					restriction was focused primarily on Germans, Bolsheviks, 
					Communists, and anarchists.&nbsp; The post-war rise of American 
					nationalism increased support for a broader and increasingly 
					racist immigration policy.&nbsp; As part of this movement, the 
					House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization began to 
					investigate issues surrounding Japanese immigrants in the 
					United States.&nbsp; After conducting preliminary hearings in 
					Washington D.C. during the summer of 1919, the Committee 
					scheduled a more comprehensive investigation for California 
					(the state with the largest Japanese population) the 
					following year.&nbsp; The main topics of thee hearings were: was

					also Washington State Congressman Albert Johnson, a 
					long-time crusader for more restrictive immigration 
					legislation.&nbsp; Johnson had a history of racial agitation in 
					Washington State. As editor, he had long used his  Grays Harbor newspaper to attack Asian immigrants and he pointedly  supported  a 1907 riot that forced hundreds of South 
					Asians in Bellingham, Washington to flee the United States

					president at the time of the congressional hearings.&nbsp; He had

					Freeman had testified before the committee in Washington 
					D.C. in 1919 and was asked by Chairman Johnson to solicit 
					additional anti-Japanese witnesses.&nbsp; In the 1919 testimony, 
					Freeman framed his animosity toward Japanese immigrants in 
					the context of competition for control over the Pacific Rim: 
					“To-day, in my opinion, the Japanese of our country look

					does not make a pleasant decoration for an inquiry on

					Supposedly, once a monopoly had been established, the

					appeared before the Congressional Committee on Immigration

					In June of 1919, U.G. Murphy had spoken on behalf of the

					their positions on the Japanese question.&nbsp; In its letter 
					dated July 24, 1920 (included in the testimony of W.R. 
					Sawhill), the Seattle Ministerial Union was clearly opposed 
					to any constitutional amendment limiting rights of Japanese

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Mark A Matthews was one of the most

					Seattle’s First Presbyterian Church which at the time 
					boasted nearly a 10, 000 member congregation, making it the 
					largest Presbyterian congregation in the United States (more 
					than double the size of the second largest church).&nbsp; Because 
					of the prominence of First Presbyterian, Dr. Matthews was 
					elected as moderator of the General Assembly of the 
					Presbyterian Church, the national governing body of the 
					Presbyterian denominations.&nbsp; This national position led to 
					an association with United States President Woodrow Wilson.&nbsp; 
					Dr. Matthews visited the White House on numerous occasions, 
					and welcomed President Wilson as a guest for one of his 
					sermons during a visit to Seattle.&nbsp; </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
					<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial">Matthews

					city.&nbsp; In previous years, he had petitioned President Wilson 
					regarding post-World War I treaties with Germany, labor 
					issues and political appointments of his associates.&nbsp; 
					Matthews had a history of swaying his massive congregation

					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
					<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial">Matthews 
					was staunchly opposed to radical labor groups such as the 
					I.W.W., anarchists, and communists.&nbsp; Many of his letters 
					contained anti-Semitic sentiments, accusing Jews of 
					supporting radical left-wing causes.&nbsp; In one of his more 
					colorful statements, Matthews advocated the deportation of 
					thousands of Russian immigrants along with other communists 
					and anarchists.&nbsp; “why,” he asked, “should we allow the gauze 
					dress of American civilization to be destroyed by the torch 
					of anarchy in the hands of these infernal enemy aliens?”<a name="_ednref49" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[49]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
					As an opponent of organized labor, Matthews’s support of the 
					Seattle Japanese community may have been an effort to weaken 
					local unions.&nbsp; The Japanese had maintained solidarity with 
					organized labor during the 1919 Seattle general strike, but 
					almost all local unions excluded Japanese from their 
					membership, and then fiercely competed with non-union 
					Japanese businesses.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
					<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial">During 
					his testimony in front of the congressional committee, Dr. 
					Matthews’s objections to discrimination against Japanese 
					immigrants were based mostly on issues of federal

					would only lead to further diplomatic problems.<a name="_ednref50" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn50"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[50]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
					Perhaps as part of his anti-labor politics, Dr. Matthews 
					expressed respect for the work ethic and business savvy he 
					identified with Japanese immigrants.&nbsp; He suggested that 
					their entrepreneurial activities made them model Americans.&nbsp; 
					In response to California Congressman John E Raker’s 
					question about Japanese taking over certain industries, Dr. 
					Matthews responded, “Now, no Jap has ever taken over 
					anything in Seattle, or will ever take over anything 
					anywhere else in this country… They bought it, and if you 
					object to a Japanese citizen or immigrant buying a fruit 
					stand, an American sold it to him.&nbsp; Now if it is not right

					<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial">In

					Tacoma Cooks’ and Waiters’ Union, and the other H.C. 
					Pickering, secretary of the Tacoma Barbers’ Union.&nbsp; Both

					A key feature of the testimony from the labor 
					representatives was a sentiment that Japanese were only a 
					limited threat to the laboring class.&nbsp; Chairman Johnson 
					expressed this point of view explicitly: “Now, we have been 
					confronted with statements in this record to the effect that 
					labor in Seattle had ceased to object to the admission of 
					the Japanese on the ground that he had ceased to become a

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
					<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial">Japanese

					By the time of the Seattle and Tacoma immigration hearings, 
					the climate of the Japanese workforce had changed 
					drastically.&nbsp; In 1920, a large percentage of the Japanese in 
					the Seattle area were engaged in farming or businesses such 
					as restaurants, hotels, groceries, laundries, and barber 
					shops.&nbsp; The labor movement that had been such a pivotal 
					factor in the nineteenth century Chinese exclusion was 
					dealing with a much different situation in the Japanese.&nbsp; 
					Though excluded by organized labor, the Japanese had formed 
					their own unions, often times abiding by many of the same 
					regulations as their mainstream counterparts.<a name="_ednref56" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn56"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[56]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
					This voluntary conformity may have been another potential 
					factor in the lack of organized labor opposition.&nbsp; The 
					Japanese had demonstrated their willingness to be loyal 
					union members.&nbsp; Abiding by the same pay scales and shop 
					standards as white unions meant that Japanese labor would 
					not under-sell white labor.&nbsp; Although only officially 
					recognized in the machinists and timber workers unions, 
					members of Japanese unions had also shown their solidarity 
					by refusing to be scab workers during the 1916

					Seattle.&nbsp; Erwin B. (Harry) Ault was the final witness to 
					testify.&nbsp; In one of the longer statements throughout the 
					proceedings, Ault cautiously spoke for the Central Labor 
					Council of Seattle.&nbsp; Ault took a purely economic stance on 
					the question of Japanese immigration and naturalization.&nbsp; 
					Although he opposed future “Asiatic” immigration, he lobbied 
					for equal rights and pay for all Japanese workers already in 
					the United States.&nbsp; He expressed that any limitation on the 
					earning power of Japanese laborers would only be detrimental 
					to the general living standards of the American worker.<a name="_ednref59" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn59"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[59]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
					He presented the marginalization of Japanese labor as a tool 
					used by business owners to lower the wage scale for workers 
					of all races.&nbsp; Ault was insistent on distancing himself and 
					organized labor from any racial element in the Japanese 
					question:&nbsp; “I say any prejudice, simply because a man’s skin 
					is dark or fair-I don’t think that is a fair estimate of a 
					man’s ability or capacity or usefulness to society or his 
					right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”<a name="_ednref60" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn60"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[60]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

					<span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial">Ault was 
					the only pro-Japanese witnesses to not condemn intermarriage 
					between whites and Asian peoples.&nbsp; After some pointed 
					questioning by a seemingly shocked Congressmen John Raker 
					who asked Ault, “You would leave the young people of the

					<i>The Town Crier</i>, which associated union advocacy with 
					simple-minded bigotry, commented on Ault’s testimony: 
					“Perforce, he wonders why Mr. Ault cannot apply some of the 
					same common sense, clear thinking and tolerance to the 
					consideration of other matters that occupy the attention of

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congressman Johnson went on to co-author the 
					1924 law that drastically curtailed most immigration to the 
					United States considered non-white, including Japanese.&nbsp; 
					Seattle’s anti-Japanese forces— particularly Miller 
					Freeman,the Anti-Japanese League, <i>The Seattle Star</i>,

					 Sakamoto co-founded the Seattle Progressive 
					Citizens League in 1921, a predecessor and model for the 
					Japanese American Citizens League (JACL).&nbsp; His leadership
