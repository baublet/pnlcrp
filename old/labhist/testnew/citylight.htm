	Bach held at New Freeway Hall (the Freedom Socialist Party’s Seattle 
	headquarters) on a summer day in 2005 was no solemn affair. Workers, 
	unionists, feminists, radicals, socialists and activists of every race and

	Teri Bach, the first woman to become a journeyman lineman at Seattle City 
	Light, had touched many lives. Her colleagues, comrades and family eulogized 
	for hours on the impact she had made fighting sexism and racism on the job. 
	How did this woman find herself in a position to affect so many individuals 
	in a positive way? By breaking ground. In 1974, Teri Bach and nine other 
	young women opened an entire industry to their gender.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On June 24, 1974 ten 
	women began their first day of work at Seattle City Light, the city’s public 
	utility. The situation was remarkable because they weren’t secretaries. As 
	Electrical Trades Trainees (ETT) in a new City Light program, designed by 
	long time Seattle activist and self proclaimed Marxist-feminist Clara 
	Fraser, the women represented the first stab at gender integration of the 
	all-male, unionized, Seattle City Light electricians. These women would 
	become the first female linemen, sub-station constructors, cable splicers, 
	the first unionized female utility electricians in Seattle and the first in 
	the nation.<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">They came from a variety 
	of backgrounds. Daisy Jones, Letha Neal, Jody Olvera and Patti Wong were 
	women of color. Angel Arrasmith, Teri Bach, Megan Cornish, Heidi Durham, 
	Jennifer Gordon, and Marge Wakenight were white. Their ages raged from 21 
	years old to 36, with some of them mothers, and some not, some married, 
	others single. Most of the trainees considered themselves feminists and a 
	few identified as Marxists as well.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to learning 
	a new and dangerous trade, their bid for integration lead the ETT 
	participants into engagement with City Light management, whose notoriously 
	anti-union superintendent Gordon Vickery morphed from a publicity-loving ETT 
	supporter into avowed ETT enemy halfway through the program. As well, the 
	union that represented the women, the International Brotherhood of 
	Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 77, reacted to gender integration with 
	periods of alternating resistance and assistance. All the demographics and 
	factors that play a part in the ETT program’s history spin a story that 
	intersects several ideological issues. Feminism, unionism and Marxism all 
	came together to influence a project that was unique in the deliberate 
	quality of its implementation and outcome. In comparison, many of the other 
	women’s training programs for traditionally male trades lacked some of the 
	social movement intersections that drove the ETT program foreward and were 
	less effective at combating sexist backlash as a result.</span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

	Background</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The history of America’s 
	gendered labor market intertwines the cultural stigmatization of women 
	through class and racial hierarchies. At the dawn of the twentieth century, 
	just 20 percent of all women worked outside the home.<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a> 
	Most women instead worked by raising children, doing housework, taking care 
	of old and sick family members, doing work on their family farm and 
	providing an often Christian ethos to the social fabric of the household. 
	All of this support at home enabled men to work harder and longer.&nbsp; Women 
	did all the domestic work to provide the market with hyper-productive male 
	workers, not to mention the fact that they raised the next generation of 
	workers and helped keep the family “biblewise” and conservative. These 
	gender roles were fundamental to the economic system and were thus 
	culturally glorified. The 19th century <span style="color: black">Fin-de-Siecle 
	art and literature portrayed women as fragile, angelic, tender, and 
	intimate. Women were considered clearly unsuited for working in the 
	unrefined outside world… unless they were women of color or immigrants 
	deemed un-American. </span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Through 
	political struggle and changing markets, women began to enter the workforce 
	at ever increasing rates throughout the 1900s. By 2003, 60 percent worked 
	outside the home, mostly in white-collar jobs.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
	The highly paid, unionized, skilled trades have been the hardest nut for 
	women to crack. Jobs like the ones that the ETT participants struggled to 
	succeed in fall into this category. The women organizers of the American 
	Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) 
	did not themselves even see the need to for women to pursue trades work 
	until the 1964 passing of the Civil Rights Act. Their justification was that 
	women didn’t want access to these jobs, considered men’s jobs, because they 
	were either too dangerous or inconvenient.<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
	The same excuse was used by employers to keep women out, though again race 
	played role in this situation as well. Employers were more willing to hire 
	minority women for dangerous “men’s” jobs and it was black women who 
	pioneered for their gender inside the automobile manufacturing, meat packing 
	and construction industries.<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Against

	used oral histories to document that women in the trades were fired, 
	laid-off or denied employment because of sexist stereotypes, not because 
	they didn’t try.&nbsp;&nbsp; Male employers and workers throughout the 1970s perceived 
	women in the trades to decrease the productivity of a crew, require more 
	training, and supposedly reduce a project’s profitability.&nbsp; Eisenberg was 
	one of the first women electricians in the San Francisco Bay Area and her 
	oral history-based writing focuses on women’s experiences in a way that lets 
	the stories speak for themselves. Her research suggests that if the issue is 
	equality vs. profit, even in the short term, profit wins. Writ large, sexism 
	(as well as racism) is good business, both in terms of paying women less 
	than men and keeping workers divided over social issues and generally 
	conservative.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">To further contextualize 
	the ETT program, it is also important to understand Seattle’s political 
	climate in the early 1970s.&nbsp; Once called the “Jet-city,” and largely defined 
	by Boeing’s aerospace manufacturing plants, 1970s Seattle was blue-collar 
	and unlike the high-tech Seattle of today, with its armies of highly paid 
	software and bio-tech professionals. A school teacher back then who asked a 
	class, “Whose dad works at Boeing?” would see a forest of raised hands. In 
	this labor dominated time and place, workers enjoyed a quality of life and 
	sense of political power greatly diminished in today’s Seattle. Not yet 
	relegated to the distant suburbs by astronomical real-estate prices or 
	socially regimented by droning workplace routines such as 6 am start times, 
	most Seattle workers enjoyed a lively lifestyle in the Northwest’s cultural 
	center. At that time, workers could not conceive of having their break times 
	monitored, their privacy violated by the degrading practice of urine testing 
	by bosses in the name of “safety” so well known to unionized workers today.<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a> 
	Seattle City Light was no exception.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Formed in 1910, Seattle 
	City Light has employed union electricians, now represented by IBEW Local 
	77, since its early days. Like most AFL unions, the IBEW organized workers 
	by their craft. The apprenticeship program that trained electricians from 
	one generation to the next relied heavily on nepotism, with entry into the 
	trade largely passed down between (male) family members. The civil rights 
	movement of the 1960s helped to significantly change the way workers, 
	especially minorities, were hired into the IBEW as well as Seattle City 
	Light. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Coming on the heels of 
	the civil rights movement’s intervention into Seattle’s construction 
	industry in 1969 (see the
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/ucwa.htm">
	UCWA History Project</a>), and a militant walkout staged by City Light 
	workers in 1974, the ETT program began in an environment charged by racial 
	conflict, as well as worker combativeness and solidarity. The political 
	period of the 1960s and early 1970s wasn’t just about the civil rights 
	movement, or feminism or the anti-war movement, either. It was a time of 
	political radicalism on all levels across the nation. Many of the white male 
	workers at Seattle City Light were themselves wrapped up in the era’s 
	upheavals and expressed themselves through job actions whose militancy was 
	much greater than today’s. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Feminism quickly added 
	itself to this charged environment.&nbsp; Outside of the ETT program, the first 
	women to integrate IBEW locals in the Seattle construction trades were 
	frequently involved in New Left political organizations. For instance:
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/sims.htm">

	activist with the United Construction Workers Association (UCWA), a civil 
	rights organization dedicated to desegregating the building trades.<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>

	federal anti-poverty program as a job skills educator. Meanwhile, Mayor Wes 
	Uhlman, fearful that former Fire Department Chief Gordon Vickery would run 
	against him, appointed Vickery Superintendent of Seattle City Light in an 
	attempt to placate his rival. Ever the politicians, Vickery and Uhlman 
	decided it would be better to voluntarily hire a few women into 
	non-traditional trades at Seattle City Light rather than risk the type of 
	lawsuits brought against the construction unions and contractors by black

	They wanted to do a training program for women and they wanted it to succeed 
	where previous ETT programs targeting low-income and non-white male workers 
	had largely failed in the past. Clara Fraser, who was well known for her

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Fraser, born to a 
	Socialist Party member mother and anarchist father, joined the  
	Young People’s Socialist League (YPSL) as a teenager. As a young woman, she 
	moved to Seattle and got a job at Boeing as electrician during WWII. Hardly 
	the popularized American icon of “Rosie the Riveter” doing a dirty job to 
	help the war effort, Fraser was a communist, anti-war activist and labor 
	agitator who helped organize the 1948 Boeing strike.<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> 
	During the anti-communist witch-hunts of the McCarthy era, she was not only 
	fired from Boeing for her politics but physically removed from the property 
	by security and blacklisted. After being “found out” and fired from numerous 
	union jobs in the Seattle area, she was hired as a receptionist in a 
	psychologist’s office. When the FBI soon confronted her employers with 
	evidence of her communism, they, unlike many other employers faced with 
	similar intimidation, said they didn’t care because Fraser was a good 
	employee.<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a> 
	After seven years at the psychologist’s office, Fraser took a job at an 
	anti-poverty organization and that’s where she was when Seattle City Light 
	sought her out to design a new program to integrate women into the utility 
	as electricians. Though the utility considered it a risk to hire on a known 
	communist and labor leader, they chose to work with Fraser because they knew 
	she had both the experience training minority workers and the connections 
	inside the women’s movement necessary to make the program successful.<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There was recently an

	asked the question, ‘Why are the numbers of women dropping off?’ And several 
	people, including women, were quoted as saying, ‘Well, you just can’t get 
	them to apply.’ Well, Clara [Fraser] didn’t find it very had. She said, 
	‘Let’s see, women who want to be in a trade where there are no women now? 
	It’s probably going to be women who aren’t afraid to swim against the 
	stream.’ So she went to the feminist movement… and said, “Hey, I’m the 
	education coordinator at City Light and we’re going to have this program so 
	come apply.’ And over 300 women did apply.”<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Radical Women (RW) was a 
	prominent feminist organization in Seattle’s women’s movement by the early 
	70s. It was a transitional organization of the “Marxist-Feminist” Freedom Socialist Party 
	(FSP), which was founded by Clara Fraser along with her husband Richard 
	Fraser in 1966 as a left split out of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party 
	(SWP).<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
	What gives the FSP its unique, predominately female demographic is the fact 
	that with in a year of the young party’s inception, Dick Fraser was expelled 
	from the organization, causing all but three of the male members to quit, 
	and leaving the FSP as a woman-dominated Marxist-feminist organization.<a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a> 
	Of the hundreds who applied for the ETT program, three of those accepted 
	were RW members. Others were affiliated with the Feminist Coordinating 
	Council, a large coalition of feminist groups which included NOW, Radical 
	Women, independent feminists and others.<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a></span></p>

	organizations with goals similar to the ETT program were in effect in the 
	1970s but didn’t have the same quality of planning or outcomes. Mechanica, 
	an organization formed by Gay Kiesling, started up around the same time as 
	the ETT program with the goal of getting women to apply for apprenticeships 
	in the exclusively male construction industry. Unfortunately, for many of 
	the same reasons that previous ETT programs at Seattle City Light failed— 
	such as the isolation of participants and lack of targeted training— most 
	groups which sought to get women into building trades didn’t set their 
	participants up for long term success.<a name="_ednref24" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Fraser designed the ETT 
	program to prepare the women for the job through two weeks of classroom and 
	physical training. She met with many of the crew chiefs, who ran the work 
	out in the field, and asked them what were the most important things to know 
	before going out on the job. With this information she compiled briefings 
	and pamphlets on basic utility electrical theory and important safety 
	measures. To get the women closer to where they needed to be in terms of 
	physical strength, Fraser researched the most rapid and effective means of 
	physical training, which turned out to be swimming.<a name="_ednref25" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a> 
	A curriculum, which included swimming, was proposed to Seattle City Light 
	management and accepted. Also, Fraser thought it was crucial that a 
	significant cohort of women be hired together. The earlier ETT programs for 
	minority men only brought in one new worker at a time. The isolation of 
	being the only minority would often become too much and most dropped out 
	with in six months.<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a> 
	Fraser insisted the women’s ETT program include a minimum of ten trainees. 
	In the past, the male trainees weren’t allowed to join the union until a 
	probationary period had elapsed. This time, the trainees would be IBEW Local 
	77 members from day one with their own bargaining unit. Lastly, the earlier 
	ETT programs had rules stipulating that applicants must be from a 
	disadvantaged background, including a maximum on the years of education that 
	they could have completed before applying. This rule was challenged so that 
	college educated women, which many of the applicants were, could be 
	considered if they were under-employed.<a name="_ednref27" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a> 
	One of the trainees had her university degree but was making $3.00 an hour 
	working as a laundress. Both Beverly Sims and Janet Lewis had their 
	university degrees before they joined IBEW Local 46 in the early 70’s as 
	construction electricians and to this day a significant number of women who 
	choose to enter non-traditional trades are already highly educated.<a name="_ednref28" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After over a year of 
	planning, and just weeks before the trainees were to begin the program, a 
	fierce walkout shook Seattle City Light.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">
	<a name="_ednref30" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn30">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">
	[30]</span></a></span></span> The issue at hand was workers’ control of 
	their working conditions. Vickery had instituted a list of rules on worker’s 
	conduct that many considered draconian. That two long time electricians were 
	disciplined by the superintendent for taking a thirty minute coffee break, 
	instead of the officially allocated fifteen minutes, set off a ten day 
	walk-out by over 1000 Seattle City Light employe<font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial"></font></span></font></span></font></span></font>es on April 10, 1974.<a name="_ednref31" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[31]</span></span></a> 
	During the course of this job action, which occurred just two months before 
	the start date of the ETT program, most of the 80% female Seattle City Light 
	clerical staff, who were not represented by IBEW Local 77, joined the 
	walk-out. Their support was crucial to effectively shutting down the 
	utility. The instigator of this solidarity action&nbsp; was none other than Clara 
	Fraser.<a name="_ednref32" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[32]</span></span></a> 
	Relegated to the lowest paid positions with little hope of advancement, 
	women at the Utility had plenty to be dissatisfied with and no affection for 
	Vickery who was brought to Seattle City Light to cut costs through wage 
	freezes and work speed-ups.<a name="_ednref33" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[33]</span></span></a> 
	This 1974 “Coffee Break Walk-out” was a success. Vickery’s new set of work 
	regulations were repealed for the time being and the workers went back on 
	the job with a new sense of empowerment and openness. This atmosphere of 
	unity and victory helped ease male-female tensions as the ETT women started 
	working with the crews in the following months.<a name="_ednref34" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[34]</span></span></a> 
	Unfortunately, IBEW Local 77 failed its promise to organize these women 
	workers like they said they would. The women’s solidarity went largely 
	un-recognized and as a result many clerical workers did not support Local 
	77’s 1975 strike, which ended in bitter defeat. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Soon after the 
	successfully 1974 walkout, day one on the job for the trainees started with 
	a press conference. Vickery posed with the women for a photo shoot and made 
	grand declarations like, “any one of you could be superintendent of City 
	Light some day.”<a name="_ednref35" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[35]</span></span></a>He 
	also made the statement, “I won’t pretend it’s the most popular program 
	we’ve ever had at City Light, but it’s a very important one”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">
	</span></span>–&nbsp; hinting that hostility to integration existed among the 
	unionized field crews.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">
	<a name="_ednref36" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn36">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">
	[36]</span></a></span></span> In reality, according to former trainees, most 
	of the men’s initial responses to the program and the presence of the women 
	were positive. Fraser had made a point of ensuring that the trainees were 
	seen as a part of the unionized workforce. The union was already indebted to 
	her for the role she played in the walk-out and a sense of unity pervaded 
	the workforce in those days. Male workers’ hostility was reserved for 
	Vickery— for now.<a name="_ednref37" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Yet there were minds to 
	be changed. City of Seattle Equal Employment Officer Joan Williams told 
	reporters that “The men on the crews, well, they’re not all stupid or 
	sexist, but they don’t have the information in their memory banks to deal 
	with working with women.”<a name="_ednref38" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[38]</span></span></a> 
	While the linemen were friendly in general, some of them didn’t believe that 
	women could do the work. Why would women be able to? The industry had 
	evolved in a way that excluded women and offered no provisions to accentuate 
	women’s strengths or accommodate their physical and social differences. 
	Megan Cornish remembers being dared by a journeyman to pull a very heavy 
	feeder cross-arm to the top of a power pole. Never having received any 
	training in the task, she accepted the challenge out of pride and surprised 
	the gawking men by haphazardly rigging the arm and using all her body weight 
	to pull it to the top of the pole instead of just her arms.<a name="_ednref39" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[39]</span></span></a> 
	Today women in non-traditional fields still constantly find themselves being 
	“tested” in similar ways.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite the hard work of 
	the trainees, the careful planning of Fraser and initial acceptance by union 
	brothers, the women faced serious obstacles to successful integration from 
	the beginning. The walkout had poisoned relations between Fraser and 
	Vickery. Vickery took out his frustration on Fraser’s ETT program. Just a 
	week after starting, all training was canceled by management: no more book 
	learning, no swimming, it was out to the field ready or not. Upon getting 
	word that their training had been canceled, most of the trainees, led by 
	Daisy Jones, the oldest and a natural leader, marched up to Vickery’s office 
	and demanded an explanation.<a name="_ednref40" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[40]</span></span></a> 
	Dissatisfied with his response, they soon filed a complaint with the city’s 
	Office of Women’s Rights saying that they were being denied the full two 
	weeks of training that male trainees had received in previous years. The 
	justification for paying trainees a dollar an hour less than lineman 
	helpers, the typical entry level field position at Seattle City Light, was 
	that what was lost in pay would be made up for in training. During the same 
	week their training was canceled, Clara Fraser was removed from the position 
	of Training Coordinator, costing the trainees their main advocate.<a name="_ednref41" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn41"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[41]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Weeks later, an employee 
	meeting was called by the “coffee break walk-out” leaders to rally for 
	demands that were still unmet, including the ouster of Vickery. Most of the 
	trainees attended, and a few made statements of solidarity with their fellow 
	workers. They all knew that the support of the crews was vital to their 
	success and they were better off standing together with the other workers 
	despite their vulnerable position with management. The rally proved to be 
	the last straw with Vickery, who called the women into the office the next 
	week. Stating they didn’t seem very happy and were causing a lot of trouble, 
	he proceeded to hand out a loyalty oath for each to sign promising that she 
	would carry out any duty required by management without complaint if she 
	wanted to keep her job.<a name="_ednref42" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn42"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[42]</span></span></a> 
	Out of fear, a few women signed the oath on the spot but the majority of ETT 
	participants took it with them so a lawyer could look it over. In the end, 
	those who had not already signed added a paragraph to the document stating 
	that by signing they were not relinquishing their constitutional rights, 
	before submitting the signed oath to management. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After a year of working 
	as trainees and an endless stream of political battles, most of the trainees 
	were essentially fired. A letter went out “congratulating” them on 
	“completing” the program and wishing them luck in future employment. So much 
	for, “Someday you can be superintendent at City Light.” The abrupt, 
	politically-motivated layoffs were meted out to each participant with the 
	exception of Patti Wong, who distinguished herself as pro-management, and 
	Jennifer Gordon, the top scoring participant on the civil service 
	proficiency tests. Keeping a token woman or two helped divert attention from 
	the idea that the firings had been gender-based. Jennifer Gordon, however, 
	quit City Light soon afterwards because she felt discriminated against.<a name="_ednref43" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn43"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[43]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	During the same period, City Light laid off Clara Fraser, officially due to 
	budget cuts. Seven years later, the courts determined, in a lawsuit filed by 
	Fraser, that&nbsp; her termination had been more akin to a political firing.<a name="_ednref44" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn44"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[44]</span></span></a> 
	After the layoffs, the ETT women amended their complaint with the Office of 
	Women’s Rights to include their dismissals.&nbsp;</span></p>

	Marxism, Feminism, and Race</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The participants of the 
	ETT program shared a sense of camaraderie because of their common situation 
	and the fact that they spent so much time together, but they did not agree 
	on tactics. While the voice of Radical Women certainly rang loud and clear 
	from the program’s designer Fraser and the three active RW members (Bach, 
	Cornish and Durham), their program was not the only set of political beliefs 
	adhered to by ETT women. Daisy Jones, who led the women in most of their 
	early battles, was a school teacher from California who had been involved in 
	the civil rights movement there for years and had her own ideas. Definitely 
	a militant, she was not a member of Radical Women. Other women in the group 
	identified with more overtly bourgeois strains of feminism than the 
	“socialist feminist” RW. One of the ten participants, Wong, who didn’t 
	consider herself a feminist at all, allied with Vickery and management, and 
	openly criticized the militancy of the program in the papers.<a name="_ednref45" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn45"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[45]</span></span></a> 
	The Marxist tendency inside the ETT program did, however, end up providing 
	the glue that held the project together. With the program disbanded, the 
	political and organizational coherence of a group like Radial Women was 
	crucial in sustaining the political fight to get their jobs back.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Along with gender and 
	class questions, the issue of race also finds prominence in ETT history. The 
	experiences of the black women trainees in particular depict the inescapable 
	centrality of racism in American history. Letha Neil, the first and only 
	black, female cable splicer at Seattle City Light was also the last of the 
	ETT participants to turn out of the apprenticeship and reach journeyman 
	status. Neil was a hard worker and never made any serious mistakes on the 
	job. Rather, she was discounted because of her race. Megan Cornish was 
	surprised at Neil’s memorial after her recent passing in 2005 to hear so 
	many eulogies referring to her big heart, big smile and big personality. On 
	the job, Neil was reserved, never known to make a stink or tell a joke, 
	perhaps never feeling like she could be herself.<a name="_ednref46" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[46]</span></span></a> 
	It’s no wonder considering the treatment she received as a black woman at 
	Seattle City Light. Early on in her training, a crew chief dubbed her “the 
	cannon ball, because she was short, round and black.”<a name="_ednref47" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[47]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In another example of degrading racism from a superior on the job, as Neil 
	walked ahead of the rest of the crew with another ETT woman her roll of 
	black electrical tape fell out of her tool belt; her crew chief yelled, “Hey 
	Letha, your ass-hole just fell out!”<a name="_ednref48" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn48"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[48]</span></span></a> 
	Race affected Daisy Jones in another way. Early on, a leader and 
	spokesperson for the ETT participants, Daisy Jones had no trouble sticking 
	up for herself. Constantly harassed, one day after one insult too many she 
	shut her crew inside a job shack and locked the door.<a name="_ednref49" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[49]</span></span></a> 
	But when she heard the ETT participants politically targeted “layoffs” were 
	coming after a year in the program she didn’t have the privilege of waiting 
	around for an answer from the Department of Women’s Rights review board. A 
	single mom of three kids, Jones had to move on to a new paycheck fast and 
	quit Seattle City Light to take a job at King County Metro driving a bus. As 
	a result, when the women were finally rehired, Jones was not eligible 
	because she had technically quit under economic duress. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Racism wasn’t just used 
	against non-white ETT women. In one instance, Teri Bach was called into 
	Vickery’s office after an anonymous complaint from “A PO’ed citizen” who 
	claimed he witnessed a four member crew with “a Negro and a girl” working on 
	it. The letter claimed, “The Negro couldn’t keep his hands off the girl. In 
	the 28 minutes I spent observing some nearby construction I noticed the 
	Negro standing, smoking and publicly fondling the girl while the other two 
	worked.” Bach was given a three day suspension for her refusal to cooperate 
	with an investigation into that and another anonymous complaint. She told 
	the <i>Seattle Times</i>, “I considered the charges leveled against me 
	totally outrageous… In addition I protested the harassment inflicted on me 
	and fellow workers by management’s repeated investigations of anonymous 
	accusations.”<a name="_ednref50" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn50"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[50]</span></span></a></span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A struggle from the 
	beginning, the ETT participants’ problems didn’t end with the termination of 
	their program. They fought to get back the jobs they were entitled to— not 
	just trainee positions, but the opportunity to become journeymen 
	electricians. After adding their “lay-offs” to the previously filed 
	complaint with the Office of Women’s Rights they took political fight to 
	repeal the layoffs to the next level: a publicity war. In the year before 
	the women got their jobs back, Heidi Durham remembers feeling as though 
	there was an article in the press about the trainee women nearly every week. 
	In fact, numerous articles were printed in both the mainstream and 
	independent media on their case against Seattle City Light, many of which 
	favored the women. The issue became a rallying cry for the broader Seattle 
	women’s movement, with support coming from the Feminist Coordinating 
	Council, an influential coalition of feminist groups. Mayor Uhlman’s 
	unsuccessful 1976 campaign for Washington State Governor was in no way 
	improved by the ETT scandal. While he was able to, and did, present himself 
	as a friend to women voters in Eastern Washington, his support of Vickery 
	against the women severely tarnished his reputation as a progressive with 
	the much more liberal and influential voters of Western Washington.<a name="_ednref51" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn51"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[51]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Less than year after 
	their layoffs, the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> reported July 9, 1976 
	that “a citizen tribunal this morning will order reinstatement of six women 
	as electrical lineman helpers at City Light.”<a name="_ednref52" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn52"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[52]</span></span></a> 
	This was an astounding victory for the women who received back pay, benefits 
	and damages that, when combined with the payment of their lawyer’s fees, 
	totaled over $100,000.<a name="_ednref53" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn53"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[53]</span></span></a> 
	Additionally, the six women were made eligible to begin the apprenticeship 
	programs that City Light would be required to offer them as a part of the 
	settlement. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While things were 
	finally going well for the women, the male electricians at Seattle City 
	Light sustained a painful defeat. A 1975 strike ended on management’s terms, 
	with not a single union demand met. Not only would the six women return to a 
	job with sub-standard wages compared to utility workers in the rest of the 
	state. They were also joining an angry workforce whose recent defeat stood 
	in marked contrast to the women’s victory.<a name="_ednref54" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[54]</span></span></a>

	In addition, Vickery was so upset at being forced to rehire these women— who 
	he regarded as traitors and agitators— that he deliberately set them up in 
	situations where they were assured failure, and in one case paved the way 
	for to Durham’s life-threatening workplace injury. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After the rehire, the 
	remaining six women were allowed to apply for apprenticeships. Typically a 
	few different programs are available at Seattle City Light, but that year 
	only the most physically strenuous one, the lineman’s apprenticeship, was 
	made available. The three RW affiliated women, Bach, Cornish and Durham were 
	the only ones to apply. Heidi Durham was no frail girl. The youngest and 
	strongest of the group, she was a natural for the job. Yet Vickery 
	deliberately set her up to fail by putting her on a crew with a known racist 
	and sexist bigot (Frank Caraback) as its chief.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">

	[56]</span></a></span></span> Part of a crew chief’s responsibility is to 
	evaluate the quality of an apprentice’s work on a monthly basis and submit a 
	review to management. In addition to the sexist remarks and lack of 
	appropriate training Durham was subjected to, she repeatedly received poor 
	reviews that didn’t accurately represent the quality of her work. One day, 
	under a tremendous amount of pressure to perform, she was working as fast as 
	she could climbing up and down power poles while her journeyman worked off a 
	bucket truck across the street. In those days, linemen were not allowed to 
	use a safety harness because it was too slow and instead “free-climbed” the 
	poles. On the way down the pole Durham’s boot hit a knot in the wood and 
	bounced off. She lost her grip, fell 28 feet and landed in a sitting 
	position.<a name="_ednref57" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn57"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[57]</span></span></a><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">“Her accident was very 
	much due to the persecution she was facing on the crew she was on,” 
	remembers Cornish, who was working on a pole across town when the accident 
	happened. “I remember that the lineman on my crew that was the most hostile 
	to me came up to me at the top of the pole I was working on, in his bucket 
	truck and said, ‘I hear your friend fall down, go boom.’ Heidi had just 
	broken her back. It still makes me furious, that S.O.B.”<a name="_ednref58" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn58"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[58]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Lying in the hospital, 
	where she spent months and was initially told she would never walk again, 
	Durham began to wonder what her union, IBEW Local 77, had to say about the 
	accident. The official safety report blamed her for the accident, 
	essentially, she recalled, because she didn’t listen to the advice of her 
	union brothers and get out of the trade. After reading this, a furious 
	Durham encouraged Bach and Cornish to attend the next union meeting and 
	demand that the report be rescinded.&nbsp; Their motion failed.<a name="_ednref59" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn59"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[59]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Hostility to the women 
	electricians had grown both in the union and workplace since their return. 
	After Durham’s injury, it was open season on the rest of them and the 
	torment increased palpably. But the opposition they encountered wasn’t 
	total. Eventually a committee of seven Local 77 brothers re-opened the issue 
	of the report. Again the motion lost, this time by a narrow margin. The 
	women felt the only thing left to do to combat the union’s bigotry would be 
	to sue. But they didn’t out of principle, deciding “It was not worth it.”<a name="_ednref60" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn60"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[60]</span></span></a> 
	IBEW Local 77 was, after all, <i>their</i> union despite its immense flaws. 
	Perhaps through their Marxist understanding of capitalism, they decided not 
	drag the organization that represented their class interests through the 
	courts. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Meanwhile, Clara Fraser 
	was battling Seattle City Light to get her job back on the charge that she 
	was discriminated against due to her sex and political beliefs by Vickery 
	and City Light management. In 1982, after a seven year fight buoyed by a 
	favorable ruling by Seattle’s Human Rights Department, a $30,000 dollar 
	settlement that was later revoked by the City Council, and a two year appeal 
	process that finally landed the case in Superior Court, Fraser got her job 
	at City Light back. In addition, she won $53,000 in back pay and damages, 
	plus 12 percent interest, plus attorney fees for a total of $135,265.14.<a name="_ednref61" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn61"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[61]</span></span></a></span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	The Outcomes</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On one hand, the success 
	of the ETT program can be measured by the rate of retention and career 
	progress seen by its participants. Unlike the building trades, women have 
	fared somewhat better in in City Light.&nbsp; While many of the young women who 
	go into construction trades view the experience as positive step in their 
	careers, or a way to learn some major life lessons and make a bit of money 
	before they move on to other things,<a name="_ednref62" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn62"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[62]</span></span></a> 
	most of the ETT participants stayed in the industry and ended up retiring 
	from City Light. Construction electrician Janet Lewis in some way is the 
	exception that proves the rule.&nbsp; Lewis spent time as a contractor, L &amp; I 
	inspector and lawyer but essentially never left the trade and is today a 
	Business Representative for IBEW Local 46.<a name="_ednref63" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn63"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[63]</span></span></a> 
	However, as of the Summer of 2006, no woman construction electrician has 
	ever retired from Local 46 with the 30,000 hours needed to collect a full 
	retirement. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The women who 
	participated in the ETT program fared much better. Megan Cornish, who never 
	saw herself as particularly suited to line-work, became the second woman 
	power station operator at Seattle City Light soon after Durham’s injury, 
	continuing in a union job that entails performing switching operations at 
	the sub-stations to rout the power on the lines. (Joann Simmons holds the 
	title for first power station operator, which actually made her the first 
	field worker as well because she started working in the Skagit long before 
	ETT program. Simmons was a pioneer, but she was also an anomaly.) Despite a 
	dramatic recovery from her injury, Heidi Durham never returned to the 
	physical level necessary for line-work. Seattle City Light offered her an 
	administrative position but she refused, insisting that they find a place 
	for her in the field earning the wages she was accustomed to. She eventually 
	joined Cornish as a power station operator before moving on to become the 
	first woman power dispatcher, a position of significant authority and 
	responsibility. The power dispatcher ensures that a power line is 
	de-energized before a line crew works on it. Surely more than one lineman 
	who had abused her in the past learned the lesson that good union workers do 
	not hurt their sisters and brothers, as they began work on a line that they 
	had to trust she had de-energized.<a name="_ednref64" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn64"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[64]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Teri Bach worked as a journey lineman until her neck was broken in a 
	horrific industrial accident. A large tree limb fell directly onto her head 
	as she worked in a bucket truck miles outside the city. She knew that she 
	had been seriously hurt and that if she moved her head it would be the end, 
	so she and a brother from the crew held her head still until they arrived at 
	the hospital. After her recovery, she became City Light’s first woman cable 
	splicer. While working on a downtown underground crew, she met her future life partner, 
	Gordon Hamilton, and taught him a thing or two about the world.<a name="_ednref65" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn65"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[65]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Eventually the women 
	also received a modicum of recognition from the union. No ETT participant 
	ever became a union official, but occasionally when they needed someone who 
	would really stand up for a member during a grievance process, especially if 
	the issue of gender or race was involved, the union would look to one of the 
	RW members in particular.<a name="_ednref66" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn66"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[66]</span></span></a> 
	At the time of their retirements, IBEW Local 77 held a special ceremony for 
	the ETT participants thanking them for their groundbreaking work and long 
	records as good union members. The plaques they were presented with were 
	addressed to, “Our Very Own Radical Socialist Bitches” referring to an 
	incident when a bigoted union official was busted calling the women that in 
	the late 1980s. After hearing of their “nickname”, they showed up at the 
	next union meeting with boxes full of “Radical Socialist Bitch” buttons and 
	by the time the meeting was brought to order nearly every union member in 
	attendance was sporting one.<a name="_ednref67" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn67"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[67]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Yet despite the positive 
	legacies of the women’s struggles, the ETT program failed because the 
	industry was never opened to more than a handful of women. The first ETT 
	program for women in 1974 was also the last. Seattle City Light was willing 
	to let a few women into the trade, but was much less interested in 
	challenging the sexist culture that thrived there or engaging feminists on a 
	continuing basis. No other woman was hired by the utility for nearly ten 
	years after the program began, until, in the midst of Fraser’s case to get 
	her job back, Radical Women started to push the issue of female hiring as 
	well. Eventually the city’s Office of Human Rights became involved and that 
	helped open the door up again. Yet the women have never enjoyed more than 
	token representation in the utility trades, never exceeding eight percent of 
	the total workforce according to one estimate.<a name="_ednref68" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn68"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[68]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though RW had pushed to 
	get City Light to hire more women in the early 1980s, the women City Light 
	hired after the termination of the ETT program had different agendas than 
	many of the original ETT participants. With the women’s rights movement of 
	the 1970s in decline, they tended to be less interested in the explicit goal 
	of challenging sexism and more interested in making a good living. Cornish 
	recalls that the second wave of women to work at Seattle City Light were not 
	activists. They would try to fit in and be “one of the guys” and often the 
	friendliest women were the first to be driven out.<a name="_ednref69" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn69"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[69]</span></span></a> 
	Durham remembers an occasion when she was a power dispatcher and a new batch 
	of lineman helpers was brought in to get a tour of dispatch, and one woman 
	in the group approached her and thanked her for her pioneering role. This 
	was unusual, however. New women hires generally got a lecture from someone 
	on their crew to the effect of, “Stay away from the ETT women. They’re 
	trouble.”<a name="_ednref70" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn70"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[70]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This kind of warning sent a message to new hires that they would not do 
	well, or perhaps would not be respected by their work teams, if they 
	continued the activism that the ETT women pioneered.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite the heroic 
	efforts of the program’s participants attempting to de-segregate the 
	industry, there hasn’t been much actual progress since then. The same can be 
	said for the pioneering women in the unionized construction trades whose 
	numbers nationally hover in abysmally low 1-3 percent range.<a name="_ednref71" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn71"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[71]</span></span></a> 
	It’s as if the door closes behind every woman who manages to open it, never 
	open long enough for a critical mass of women to enter the trade and change 
	the workplace culture, and leaving the women who make it in dire isolation. 
	Yet women have broken into many other male dominated industries. Once upon a 
	time, nearly all occupations were strictly male and now the majority of 
	American women work outside the home. What is it that has made gender 
	integration so difficult in these highly paid unionized trades? Perhaps it 
	is that these jobs are highly paid and, because of their union contracts the 
	wages are not very susceptible to degradation. Often when women enter a job 
	field, “colonization” occurs, a phenomenon in which men leave , the job 
	becomes predominately female, and wages plummet. A classic example is the 
	field of gynecology. What used to be a highly paid medical specialty lost 
	its prestige after being opened to women. Now male doctors are more apt to 
	seek a higher paid specialty such as cardiology or plastic surgery which 
	hasn’t been opened up.<a name="_ednref72" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn72"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[72]</span></span></a> 
	A capitalist market economy has no interest in integrating its workforce 
	unless there is a profit incentive. Employers rarely want to open up 
	traditionally male-dominated jobs to women except to drive wages down.&nbsp; This 
	has the double effect of excluding women from some of the best-paid jobs, as 
	well as pressuring feminist movements into fighting with male workers for a 
	piece of a shrinking pie.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another reason why women 
	have not succeeded in the electrical trades despite integration efforts is 
	that the attempts have not focused on significantly changing the trade to 
	accommodate women. Concrete cultural and physical obstacles stand in the way 
	of women wanting to pursue a career as an electrician. After all, no reason 
	exists why most healthy women wouldn’t succeed as electricians, and even 
	flock to the well-paid trade, with proper accommodation. For instance, 
	hurdles such as the inability to match work hours with daycare availability 
	could be remedied by more a more flexible work schedule or at-work child 
	care facilities. Paid leave for pregnant women and new mothers and fathers 
	would allow women to work and have families regardless of their personal 
	situation. And of course any comprehensive health plan would need to cover 
	abortion. The gap in physical strength between some men and some women could 
	be surmounted by changes in material designs to favor lighter, easier to 
	work with materials, or by the advancement of tool technology, or by simply 
	having workers pair up for more physically challenging tasks. This would no 
	doubt decrease the incidents of injury among male workers as well. Different 
	reproductive health issues between men and women, such as the amount of 
	lead, mercury, radioactive materials and other toxins a person of 
	reproductive age can safely be exposed to, should also be held to the 
	highest standard. Just because a man might not be as likely to father a 
	disfigured or mentally retarded child because of toxin exposure does not 
	mean that exposure is healthy. The reason for the continuation of all these 
	factors that discourage women from joining the electrical trade is that 
	making the changes to nullify them would interfere with profit. Ultimately 
	the responsibility for ensuring these changes lies with the union 
	leadership. It is their duty to represent the interests of the working class 
	against the interests of the bosses on an economical level. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Integrating the utility 
	and building trades presents a challenge to the union leadership. It cannot 
	be an either/or situation. Their responsibility is to both defend working 
	conditions, like wages, and make the trade materially, socially and 
	culturally accessible to workers regardless of gender or race. 
	Unfortunately, that’s not what they did in the 1970s and it’s not what 
	they’re doing now. Clara Fraser’s explicit understanding of the profit 
	system, with her perspective on union culture and the needs of minorities, 
	gave her an advantage in implementing a successful albeit limited 
	integration program which the average trade union official lacks. Or as 
	Heidi Durham put it in a recent interview, “Organized labor has a tremendous 
	role to play but we can’t accomplish it with the current leadership of the 
	AFL-CIO. The ones who want to please business and government are the ones 
	who are holding us back.” More, better and continuous ETT programs may not 
	be enough to fully open the trades to women, but the movement inside Seattle 
	City Light that happened as a result of the ETT program is definitely worth 
	emulating.</span></p>
