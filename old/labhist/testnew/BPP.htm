    The Black Panther Party for Self Defense established its Seattle chapter in the spring of 1968. It was one of the first to be created outside 

	of California. The Seattle chapter also lasted longer than most, surviving until 1978. 

	Although the membership was never large, the organization made a major 

	impact on the region. With their black berets and 

	leather jackets and their commitment to armed self defense, the Panthers 

	became role models to some while scaring others. Either way, 

	the organization showed Seattle that its struggles for racial justice had moved 

	beyond persuasion and nonviolent protest.</font></p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded t he Black Panther Party in Oakland, California, in late 1966. 

	  The rest of the world learned about the organization the following year, 

	  after a contingent of heavily armed Panthers marched onto the floor of the 

	  California legislature protesting a bill to ban firearms in public places. 

	  Weapons and armed self defense&nbsp; were key elements in the Panther 

	  program, one part of which focused on protecting black communities from 

	  brutal policing practices. Calling police officers &quot;pigs,&quot; and following 

	  them as they patrolled black neighborhoods, the Panthers were soon involved 

	  in deadly gun battles with&nbsp; police in Oakland and later in other 

	  cities. The uninformed thought of the Panthers as Black Nationalists, but 

	  the Party was actually committed to revolutionary internationalism, taking 

	  some of its program from the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; (Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse Tung) and identifying with third-world revolutionary movements.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Washington state 

	chapter of the BPP was established in April, 1968 after Aaron Dixon, Elmer 

	Dixon, Anthony Ware, Gary Owens and several other future Panthers 

	attended a memorial service in San Francisco for 17 year-old Bobby Hutton. 

	Hutton had been killed by Oakland police in a shootout in which Party leader Eldridge 

	Cleaver was also wounded. While in Oakland, the Seattle youth met  BPP Chairman Bobby Seale, whose subsequent visit to Seattle marked 

	the beginning of the Washington State chapter. The history of the 

	Washington State chapter can be followed in the accompanying pages. </font></p>
