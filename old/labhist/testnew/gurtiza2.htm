vidtitles[0]="+Early Life"

vidtitles[1]="Rich Gurtiza was born in Wapato, Washington.  He went to work in the Alaska canneries in the 1970s and became active in the union reform movement in the early-1980s."

vidtitles[2]="&quot;It was pretty much a rite of passage to go work in the Alaska canneries&quot;"

vidtitles[3]="+Work Life and Discrimination in the Alaska Canneries"

vidtitles[4]="Cannery workers like Gurtiza worked eighteen-hour days, in wet conditions, and covered in fish guts."

vidtitles[5]="&quot;I was doing the same jobs but making half of what white kids were making.&quot;"

vidtitles[6]="Filipino cannery workers lived in segregated housing, ate at segregated mess halls, and were considered second-class citizens at the work sites."

vidtitles[7]="Workers in the canneries had to pay corrupt union officers and foremen to get dispatched."

vidtitles[8]="The living and working conditions in the canneries influenced Gurtiza to join the reform movement."

vidtitles[9]="+The ACWA and the Reform Movement"

vidtitles[10]="The Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA) was formed to combat discrimination in both unions and hiring practices."

vidtitles[11]="&quot;The only way to move things is through coalition building.  Part of how ACWA got formed was working with the African American construction workers and developing those relationships.&quot;"

vidtitles[12]="The ACWA took inspiration from Chris Mensalvas, a Filipino immigrant who helped organize Alaskan cannery workers in the 1940s."

vidtitles[13]="+Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes"

vidtitles[14]="&quot;Gene would do anything for you, and same with Silme.  They&lsquo;d give you the shirt off their back.&quot;"

vidtitles[15]="&quot;Gene believed that we should live by the legacy of Harry Bridges and not be a corrupt and non-democratic union.&quot;"

vidtitles[16]="&quot;I consider him like my older brother.  He taught me a lot of stuff and in fact Gene tried to protect me from some of the bad elements in the union.&quot;"

vidtitles[17]="In 1981, reform movement leaders Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes were murdered.  A subsequent civil suit ruled that Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos had ordered the killings."

vidtitles[18]="The murders brought union members and community activists together.  The larger Filipino community, however, continued to question the reform movement."

vidtitles[19]="+The Legacy of the Reform Movement"

vidtitles[20]="&quot;We were able to take over all the leadership positions in the majority of the executive board within the local…we were able to train a lot of other leaders who became leaders and organizers in other unions.&quot;"

vidtitles[21]="Today, as a result of the reform movement, Filipino cannery workers live in integrated bunk houses, eat at integrated mess halls, and do the same jobs—for the same pay—as white workers."

vidtitles[22]="In 1992 the AFL-CIO created the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA) to make inroads into organizing Asian workers.  Gurtiza was an early member and helped the organization get off the ground."

vidtitles[23]="&quot;The Filipino community doesn&lsquo;t necessarily pay tribute to or understand what the organization meant to the history of this area.&quot;"

vidtitles[24]="&quot;The work&lsquo;s still hard and the hours are still long and you&lsquo;re still going to get wet...the job hasn&lsquo;t necessarily been automated to the point where all you do is press a button.&quot;"

vidtitles[25]="+Final Thoughts"

vidtitles[26]="In the last few years, The Washington State labor council has been diversified through constituency groups that represent minority workers."

vidtitles[27]="Environmental changes are affecting—and will likely continue to affect—the fishing and cannery industries."

vidtitles[28]="Today, Local 37 focuses on typical union issues: addressing grievances, getting contracts, and taking care of the workers."

vidtitles[29]="&quot;I take pride in the organization and what it represents…I’m just glad I was able to carry on some of the legacy of this organization and especially Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo, because they really are my heroes.&quot;"

		    <p> Richard Gurtiza is  President of Region 37, Inlandboatman&rsquo;s Union/ILWU, representing Alaska cannery workers.  He has been a member of Local 37 since 1977 and Regional Director of the IBU since 1993. </p>
		    <p>Gurtiza was born in the small farming community of Wapato, Washington in the 1950s. Like many young Filipino Americans in Washington, he went to work in the Alaska canneries in the late-1970s. </p>
		    <p> Cannery work was difficult. Men stood neck-deep in fish unloading cargo holds and sometimes spent eighteen-hour days on their feet, gutting and canning fish. </p>
		    <p>  Filipino Americans who worked in this industry were treated poorly, paid the lowest wages, and given the worst jobs. They lived in segregated bunkhouses, ate at segregated mess halls, and were treated poorly by other workers and their employers. Moreover, corrupt union officials charged men for jobs and found other ways to extort money. </p>
		    <p> In the late 1970s, these conditions led activist Filipino cannery workers to reform the union and fight for better working conditions. Gurtiza was active in this movement. He worked side-by-side with Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes&mdash;the leaders of the Alaska Cannery Workers Association&mdash;to build the reform movement. After Domingo and Viernes were murdered in 1981, Gurtiza and other reformers won leadership positions and transformed Local 37.</p>
		    <p> In 1992, Gurtiza continued to advocate for Asian-American workers when he joined the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance. In 1993 he was named regional director of the IBU. He remains active in the IBU/ILWU, the King County Labor Council, and the Washington State Labor Council. </p>
		    <p>Rich Gurtiza shared memories of his life and actvism in an interview with Michael Schulze-Oechtering Castenada and Steve Beda conducted on July 16, 2008. To the right are video excerpts.</p>
