				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I started this project, I knew it might be tough 
				to remain objective.&nbsp; The reason: I was once a member of this 
				over named behemoth, which is the Seattle/King County Building &amp; 
				Construction Trades Council.&nbsp; Although, I must admit, I never 
				held this knowledge until my university education forced it upon 
				me. My career began as an apprentice in the International 
				Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which is an officially 
				associated member of the Seattle/King County Building &amp; 
				Construction Trades Council.&nbsp; Honestly, I dealt very little with 
				the latter, and more with the former.&nbsp; On the UW campus, 
				however, the skilled trades are represented directly by the 
				Building Trades Council.</p>

				&nbsp; In truth, I was at a point in my life where I had grown tired 
				of soliciting better long distance service or donations to 
				not-for-profit organizations over the phone from unwilling 
				customers who were inevitably “in the middle of dinner”, and did 
				not want to talk to me.&nbsp; Life as a <i>Telephone Sales 
				Representative</i>, surprisingly, is not all it may be cracked 
				up to be.&nbsp; I had held many other equally untasty jobs before 
				that.&nbsp; I was looking for a change, and I needed it fast.</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, the Seattle/King County Building &amp; 
				Construction Trades Council (furthermore referred to as just 
				“the Council”, which, although ringing slightly Orwellian, is 
				much easier to type) had been helping to put food upon my 
				childhood table.&nbsp; Also for years, my father had been hounding me 
				to consider joining the IBEW, to learn the trade of electricity, 
				so that I too might one day put food upon <i>my</i> child’s 
				table.&nbsp; He had “come up” through the IBEW apprenticeship, and 
				was now a Journeyman Electrician in good standing (in line to 
				receive quite a pension, I might add).&nbsp; I resisted for years, 
				feeling that my father had worked <i>way</i> harder than I ever 
				wanted to for the kinds of rewards he seemed to be winning from 
				it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, after receiving ruthless rejection upon 
				rejection from faceless voices in cities I had never heard of, 
				and after being cursed at by haughty housewives who were livid 
				with my apparent gall to try and sell something to their 
				recently deceased husbands (how was I supposed to know he was 
				dead, ma’am?), I relented, and signed up for that organization 
				which my family simply refers to as “the Union.”</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Do unions have a place in the dawning of this new

				about to find out.</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first personal experience with Local #46 was the 
				admission procedure, which did not resemble a job interview by 
				any stretch of the term.&nbsp; I filled out some papers, issued my 
				high school transcripts, took a fairly benign test, and was 
				assured a phone call.&nbsp; And, as much as the strictness of these 
				admissions were touted, I actually <i>did</i> receive a call 
				within two weeks, and was on my first job, tools jostling around 
				in a too-clean, too-stiff work belt the next day.&nbsp; My dad was so 
				proud.</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, my experience with “the Union” never 
				got better than this, and since this really is not a story about 
				me, I will endeavor to keep this short.&nbsp; </p>

				Local #46’s electrical program for first year apprentices 
				consisted of an immense amount of repetitive, tedious labor 
				which, in the field, we call “pre-fab”, short for <i>
				prefabrication</i>.&nbsp; Although the state only requires four years 
				of electrical experience for an apprentice to “turn out”, or to 
				become a state certified Journeyman, the Union made a <i>deal</i> 
				with the local electrical contractors to extend the 
				apprenticeship to five years.&nbsp; The Union justified this as an 
				opportunity to have better, well-trained Journeymen in the 
				field, but really they just dropped the starting wage of first 
				year apprentices so that contractors could have incredibly cheap 
				labor for a whole year to do “pre-fab.”&nbsp; All in all, it wasn’t a 
				whole lot of fun, and sometimes I even wished I was back on the 
				phone talking to dead men’s wives.&nbsp; It was about this time at 
				which the union decided to kick me out (discharge, as they say, 
				which is a much more emphatic word and brings to mind images of 
				warfare) for calling my <i>Journeyman</i> instead of my <i>shop
				</i>when I was going to miss a day due to illness (it clearly 
				states in section 33 of the apprentice manual that one must call 
				the <i>shop</i> and not the <i>Journeyman</i>); I really wasn’t 
				that disappointed.&nbsp; The non-union sector scooped me up with open 
				arms, and they didn’t even <i>have</i> a manual.</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve worked for non-union electrical contractors ever 
				since, and have “turned out” just fine.&nbsp; This, as one can see, 
				makes objectivity with this subject somewhat strained.&nbsp; However, 
				since both my father and brother still work in “the Union”, I 
				have found myself in a unique position to understand and 
				appreciate two sides of this issue.&nbsp; So… out with objectivity!&nbsp; 
				I’m just going to tell you readers what I <i>think</i>.</p>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was job-hunting about a year ago, when I came upon 
				an advertisement in the Seattle Times for a Journeyman 
				Electrician on the University of Washington campus.&nbsp; Admittedly, 
				the first thing that popped into my mind when I saw this was, &quot;H<i>ey, 
				I bet <span class="GramE">there’s a lot of girls</span> there…&quot;</i> 
				which is something we see very little of in this trade, and 
				would be quite a job perk (you can roll your eyes now at the 
				blatant reinforcement of the construction worker stereotype).&nbsp; 
				However, the second thing I thought was, &quot;H<i>ow do they expect 
				to get a journeyman electrician for $22 per hour when I can get 
				closer to $30 in the private sector?&quot;</i>&nbsp; It puzzled me that a 
				state-funded institution, which charges me close to $1500 per 
				quarter, would be unable to pay a Journeyman Electrician the 
				local prevailing wage.&nbsp; At the time, I didn’t understand how 
				much the Washington State Legislature had to do with the wages 
				on campus, but now I understand they had <i>everything</i> to do 
				with it.</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Washington Administrative Code (WAC) is a mammoth 
				conglomerate of rules and regulations, articles and outlines, 
				about which nearly everything public revolves in this state.&nbsp; 
				Reading it is like reading Swahili philosophy.&nbsp; As an 
				electrician, I am constantly referring to a section of this code 
				to research such things as: <i>At what angles do I need to 
				support the guy wires from the service mast of a single-family 
				dwelling if the mast is supported in two places below the roof 
				line and the service drop conductors are at least 18 feet above 
				a residential driveway?</i>...etc.&nbsp; People get paid tax money to 
				memorize such things, and to let other people know when they are 
				not following them precisely.&nbsp; Most of us don’t know these rules 
				even exist.</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WAC article #251 is an entire subsection of 
				regulations regarding higher education labor law.&nbsp; The article 
				states in 251-08-005 that “the director shall prepare… and 
				periodically revise…compensation plans for all classes.”&nbsp; The 
				term “classes” here refers to different classifications of 
				employees in higher education.&nbsp; “Compensation” is the ambiguous 
				term which could be more easily summed up as “salary.”&nbsp; So, if I 
				might endeavor to break this down for our readers, it is 
				essentially the state legislature which sets the wages of public 
				employees in higher education, including the fine members of the 
				Building Trades Council.&nbsp; The article goes on to explain that 
				the salaries set by the “director” will be assigned “reflecting
				<i>prevailing</i> rates in other public employment and in 
				private employment in this state or in the locality in which the 
				institution is located.”&nbsp; </p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, the disparity between <i>my</i> definition of 
				“prevailing rates” and the state’s definition is cavernous.&nbsp; 
				Using the example of my profession, University of Washington 
				electricians can hope to make approximately 70% (or less) of the 
				local prevailing wage.&nbsp; These numbers seem to jive with what 
				I’ve been told by Tom Whisenant, the plumber-turned-business 
				representative who busily expresses the needs of the Council 
				members to the state.&nbsp; He places the average wage for UW Council 
				members, which are included in many trades such as carpenters, 
				plumbers, painters, and machinists, at around 60% of the average 
				private sector employee in the same field.&nbsp; On top of that, 
				these tradesmen are obligated to join the Council within about 
				60 days of their employment by the University, after which they 
				will be responsible for paying an average of 1.1% of their gross 
				income to Council dues.&nbsp; It’s no wonder there is some dissention 
				in the ranks of this “brotherhood.”</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past ten years, Tom has helped to defend the 
				Council from six decertification votes.&nbsp; These votes would have 
				essentially thrown the Council off campus, leaving the trades to 
				fend for themselves with the state and the University 
				administration.&nbsp; Another vote is closing in swiftly.&nbsp; One might 
				believe that the administration or some other outside source was 
				instigating these votes, but it is in fact the <i>members</i> 
				who are bringing them about.&nbsp; With 30% of the members on campus 
				calling for them, these votes necessarily must occur, and occur 
				they have, but <span class="GramE">to</span> little avail 
				historically.&nbsp; </p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				With another vote on the way and some groundbreaking legislation 
				currently being passed in Olympia regarding the role of the 
				Council on campus, Tom is understandably breathless.&nbsp; He seems 
				to get it from both sides.&nbsp; On one hand, the Council members 
				feel they are paying dues to an organization which seems to help 
				them very little, and on the other hand, the state has 
				historically ensured the confirmation of these beliefs, allowing 
				Tom to merely “suggest” beneficial treatment of his assembly.&nbsp; 
				Apparently, the state only heeds about 60% of Tom’s 
				“suggestions.” </p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				I believe everyone could essentially agree that wages, or the 
				lack thereof, are the kingpin issue here.&nbsp; Sure, the workers are 
				provided with decent benefits, as are all state workers; 
				however, <i>I</i> am also provided with stellar benefits from my 
				current private sector employer, <i>and</i> I am earning close 
				to 30% more than what I would have been earning had I taken the 
				University job.&nbsp; Also, I don’t have to shell out a percentage of 
				my pay into an organization, which claims to be trying to help 
				me, yet has its hands tied by governmental bureaucracy nearly to 
				the extreme of ineffectuality.</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				Of course, the Council is no stranger to bureaucracy.&nbsp; They live 
				it.&nbsp; Tom has been living it for so long, he probably can’t even 
				remember how to thread pipe.&nbsp; He jokes after explaining that his 
				proletariat will once again be voting to decertify in May, “It 
				makes no difference to me… I can just as easily go back to 
				turning the wrenches.”&nbsp; His mustachioed, salt-and-pepper face 
				droops slightly as he digresses, “Although I rather prefer 
				this…” he says, grabbing at the buttons of his sport jacket, 
				“…to the coveralls.”&nbsp; One can see, from the brief sparkle of 
				sadness in his <span class="GramE">eye, that</span> Tom 
				Whisenant really <i>does </i>care.&nbsp; He cares for reasons less 
				shallow than that of clean dress.&nbsp; The man wants nothing more…in 
				fact, <i>does</i> nothing more than to lobby undauntingly for 
				his cause.&nbsp; He does so much of this; I could hardly get a word 
				with him.&nbsp; So, for a Council member to say that his or her union 
				is doing nothing for <span class="GramE">them,</span> I suggest 
				they try to find Tom in an idle moment.</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				All of Tom’s, and many other people’s, hard work is about to pay 
				off.&nbsp; After being subjected to fourteen years of hard lobbying, 
				the Washington State legislature is finally passing the Civil 
				Employment Reform Act, which will alter the face of public 
				employment in ways that will make present civil employment 
				practices seem archaic and totalitarian in retrospect.&nbsp; Indeed, 
				some employees likely feel this way <i>currently.</i></p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				Probably the most groundbreaking change this Act will queue is 
				the right for the Council to engage in collective bargaining for 
				workers’ wages.&nbsp; As mentioned before, the state had previously 
				set the wages of employees on campus.&nbsp; The Council would be able 
				to haggle for better benefits, better working conditions, and 
				possibly better training.&nbsp; In fact, collective bargaining allows 
				the Council to do all of those things, which it has been paid to 
				do for so many years, but has been unable to do.&nbsp; It would be 
				counter to reason for the members of the UW Council to vote in 
				favor of decertification at this paramount juncture.&nbsp; It would 
				be like throwing in the towel after knocking your opponent to 
				the mat.</p>
				<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
				Not all is peachy with this Act, however.&nbsp; There is, from the 
				standpoint of labor, one major downfall: the right to strike is 
				still not permitted.&nbsp; The reason this is a major downfall should 
				be self-evident.&nbsp; Without the right to strike legally, any 
				action taken by the Council which resembles a strike would not 
				only put them at odds with the administration, but also it would 
				pit them against the state-controlled police force.&nbsp; Also, by 
				striking illegally, it is very hard for the lawyers to sway 
				judges into the Council’s court in case anything unsavory should 
				happen.&nbsp; By not allowing the Council to strike, the state in 
				effect pulls the rug of repercussion from under the workers’ 
				feet.&nbsp; The right to collectively bargain is well and good, but 
				what happens if the state won’t <i>bargain?</i>&nbsp;
				<span class="GramE">More <i>lobbying?</i></span></p>

				These are the kinds of things that frustrate skilled workers.&nbsp; 
				The fact is<span class="GramE">,</span> the idea of prevailing 
				wage is something that is less ambiguous than one might think.&nbsp; 
				If one was to ask any skilled worker on any jobsite in the 
				Seattle area what the prevailing wage for his or her profession 
				is, the vast majority of those polled would answer with a number 
				that would be within two or three percent of each other.&nbsp; <i>
				Thirty</i> percent is an outrage! </p>

				The people performing the electrical, mechanical, and plumbing 
				duties in this city are <i>highly</i> skilled workers.&nbsp; It took 
				as long or longer for them to obtain their respective licenses 
				than it will take many students to earn a bachelor’s degree.&nbsp; 
				Most of them spend years in a schooling program while working 
				full time, and in culmination are expected to pass a grueling, 
				state-operated test which runs many hours.&nbsp; Contrary to certain 
				stereotypical images, these professionals are generally bright 
				enough to read, understand, and memorize codebooks the size of 
				bibles, which are so full of cryptic jargon, they <i>must</i> 
				have been written by lawyers.&nbsp; Does the state expect qualified, 
				intelligent, skilled workers to not notice the huge wage gap?&nbsp; 
				These people, using trigonometric functions, notice when the 
				degree of bend in a pipe is over the allowable limit.&nbsp; They know

				When I was a member of Local #46, the pay gradient was 
				negotiated by the Union.&nbsp; There were certain wages, depending on 
				your level of experience, that were indisputable.&nbsp; Every man was 
				paid the same as the man next to him, as long as they were both 
				in the same level, no matter the disparity in the <i>quality</i> 
				of the worker.&nbsp; Most were good workers, though, because we were 
				generally being compensated well for our labor.&nbsp; In the 
				non-union sector, however, there are vast differences in the 
				rate which one employer will pay one employee versus another.&nbsp; 
				And, there are significant differences in the rate at which one
				<i>employer</i> is willing to pay over another.&nbsp; I can honestly 
				say, I’ve worked with them all, and there is one saying in this 
				industry which rings true, no matter which trade you’re in: “You 
				pay peanuts… you get monkeys.”</p>

				I’m not trying to infer that the tradesmen on campus are 
				“monkeys.”&nbsp; I’m almost positive there are some very qualified 
				workers, which help keep the school running.&nbsp; Some of them 
				likely work at the University because the quality of the job and 
				its various perks (see above) outweigh, for that individual, the 
				pay disparity.&nbsp; However, I can say that the likelihood of a 
				skilled worker <i>staying</i> at a job where he or she was being 
				paid at 70% scale for any great amount of time is low.&nbsp;
				<span class="GramE">The further the gap, the higher the 
				likelihood that less and less skilled workers find their way 
				onto our campus.</span>&nbsp; This is an issue which affects every 
				one of us.&nbsp; The quality of work and compensation for it are not 
				only political issues.&nbsp; They are also public safety issues, 
				since these workers are affecting the very workings of the 
				facility.&nbsp; In effect, the state is supporting a policy, which 
				could potentially contribute to an unsafe environment at the 
				University.&nbsp; If the Council can remedy this, I’m all for it.</p>

				It might seem contrary to an outsider for a non-union employee 
				to support the actions of a unionized workforce.&nbsp; In truth, this 
				is much more common than one might think.&nbsp; Most of my non-union 
				counterparts understand the complexity of labor in the Seattle 
				area.&nbsp; Many outsiders, and even union members themselves, 
				believe that non-union tradesmen hold some sort of deep 
				resentment for the union.&nbsp; Actually, non-union skilled workers 
				understand and appreciate the value of a strong union workforce 
				in the area.&nbsp; Without this, all of our wages would likely be 
				lower, some of our benefits would likely be cut, and working 
				conditions across the board would generally be poorer.&nbsp; In 
				essence, a strong union membership forces <i>all</i> employers 
				to conform to union standards, else risk the unpalatable 
				prospect of attaining low-quality workers.&nbsp; Even non-union 
				contractors pay well above the amount the state is apparently 
				willing to pay its tradesmen.</p>

				So, in response to my earlier impasse, <i>yes</i>, the union <i>
				does</i> have a place in these modern times.&nbsp; It <i>does </i>
				have a place at the University.&nbsp; The fact that unions exist <i>
				at all</i> essentially maintains the standard of high quality 
				workmanship within our entire state.&nbsp; Obviously, I’m not 
				advocating unions <i>completely</i>; otherwise, I would be a 
				union member myself.&nbsp; There are also many difficulties inherent 
				in unionization, such as the abolition of merit-based 
				advancement, the muddiness of large bureaucracy, and the 
				disabling of a contractor’s ability to reprimand poor 
				workmanship.&nbsp; These issues could all be discussed separately at 
				great length.&nbsp; Nevertheless, one has to weigh the good and the 
				bad in every situation, and decide for one’s self whether or not 
				unionization is right for her or him.&nbsp; There is no riper 
				situation for unionization presently than in the public sector, 
				where wages have been steadily falling behind the status quo for 
				decades.&nbsp; Hopefully the members of the UW Council, as they have 
				so many times before, realize this when the decertification vote 
				comes up in May, and vote it down.&nbsp; Hopefully, the years of Tom 
				Whisenant’s and others’ struggles will finally pay off for 
				everyone concerned, culminating in higher wages and a safer 
				environment on the University of Washington campus. </p>
