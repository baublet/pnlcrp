who are members of the Local 1488 WFSE union. Eric, a long time custodian, was
once very active in the union but in the last few years has become
disillusioned with the union and currently only pays his dues. Cindy, like
Eric, has also been a long time custodian. Due to her schedule, she no longer
attends meetings, but she does pay her dues, signs union petitions, and tries
to keep up to date on union issues. Roger, a custodian for only several years,
presents himself as a very enthusiastic and active union member. He seems to be
inspired by the leadership of the current president of the Local, John Frazier
and wants to build the Local union into a strong and powerful force by making
it more visible to members and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>

hierarchal structure of the custodial management seems to be as follows: at the
top is the upper management of the University, starting with the president of
the University; under them is some sort of middle management; below them are
the supervisors; and finally the supervisors have worker leads who help to
monitor the custodians. All three of the members I interviewed seem to hold a
high opinion of the upper management, characterizing them as professional and
respectful to the custodians. The only problem they found with upper management
was their apparent unawareness of what middle management was doing. Middle
management, at best, seems to be viewed as distrustful and unqualified. Roger
went as far as to say they were corrupted by power and treated the custodians
as a class below them. He does not like his supervisor and holds the same
opinion of supervisors as he does of middle management.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cindy likes her supervisor, who treats her
nicely, but is aware of other supervisors who are not so good. Eric doesnt
like his current supervisors, but sympathizes with the supervisors difficult
position of mediating between different workers and management.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All three members believe that supervisors
usually are not qualified for their position, citing that few have ever
actually worked as custodians and, thus, do not have any working knowledge of
the kind of labor involved in custodial duties. They also do not believe that
most supervisors have the communication skills to manage such a diverse group
of workers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.6in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The diversity of the custodial staff
is due mainly to the large number of immigrant workers. Eighty-five percent of
the custodians are considered minorities and many of those are Asian<a

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Eric estimated that close to three-fourths of
the custodians on campus are immigrants. All three members feel that language
barriers between the workers themselves and between workers and management have
caused misunderstandings, distrust, conflicts, and have affected the efficiency
of their work and quality of the job they are able to do. Some of the
supervisors are also immigrants, which seems to further complicate the issue.
For instance, Cindy told of one Ethiopian supervisor who speaks to the other
Ethiopian custodians in their native tongue, causing non-Ethiopian custodians
to feel distrust toward her, because they do not know what she is saying. Roger
explained that they have had to start using inferior cleaning chemicals in an
attempt to decrease the chance of an immigrant misreading a bottle and misusing
a potentially dangerous chemical. Roger also believes that management
segregates immigrants, allowing for less communication between workers about
such things as the union. The example he gave was that during a strike last
year, a group of Korean custodians did not participate because they had been
misinformed about the strike by their supervisor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This supervisor, who spoke Korean, wasn't
able to pass on any information about the impending strike because they, as a
group, had been isolated and weren't able to get the information from other
custodians outside their own immediate group. He also thinks that management
abuses the immigrants limited knowledge of workers rights to intimidate them
and keep them uninformed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.6in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The primary current concern of the
custodians about their jobs is the possible implementation of a new cleaning
strategy called, Teamwork. The strategy of Teamwork is to divide the
custodians into teams of two, three, or four and then give them a specific list
of tasks to perform throughout a building or even a group of buildings. This is
quite different from the current system of assigning a custodian an area to
clean alone. Middle management believes that Teamwork will be more efficient
and help to reduce strain on an already tight budget. Cindy feels that with the
new method, the whole team would be responsible for getting the assigned tasks
completed and because of that the custodians who are the harder workers will
end up picking up the slack for the lazier and less productive custodians. She
also anticipates communication problems occurring between team members. Roger
agrees with her, citing that in Mary Gates Hall, where they have been
experimenting with Teamwork over the last few years, there has been a large
increase in conflicts amongst workers, sometimes even escalating into violence.
Eric, who works in Mary Gates Hall in the Teamwork system, does not mind the
system himself, because he enjoys his tasks, but does admit to not liking it in
the past when he was on bathroom cleaning duty. He also says he has seen an
increase in conflicts amongst his coworkers since the implementation of
Teamwork. All three members feel that middle management should have either
consulted them or the union before implementing Teamwork. </p>

margin-left:.6in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>As far as the actual work of being
custodians is concerned, all three workers expressed that they do enjoy their
jobs and get a feeling of satisfaction from them. They appreciate the benefits
that they receive from the University  such as insurance, the chance to attend
the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Washington</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> for free, up
to a month of vacation time a year, and eight hours or more of sick leave a
month. They also recognize that compared to other custodial jobs that they are
pretty lucky to work at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The base of WFSE is its membership. The
members belong to a local and have a shop steward in their workplace. The
steward handles grievances and helps members with other union matters. The
custodial stewards are divided into areas, so that for every supervisor, there
is a steward. The local has meetings once a month for its members and the local
leadership to discuss issues and possibly vote on and implement solutions. The
local leadership, with member support, handles most of the issues that come up.
Issues that are too large for the local leadership are passed on to the upper
leadership via an area representative. The upper leadership deals with the
issues given to it by the area representative, as well as organizes and
participates in state legislative lobbying. This model depends on active participation
by members, effective communication between and within all levels of the union,
and strong leadership. Both Eric and Roger believe that some of these essential
elements have been missing and thus have weakened the union. Eric also believes
that many members are apathetic and that this apathy allows for poor union
leadership. He thinks the leadership concentrates more effort on legislative
lobbying, rather than dealing with workplace or worker raised issues. Roger, on
the other hand, is confident about the leadership, but also feels that because
of the apathy of the members, the leadership finds it difficult to complete
many of its objectives, especially those in the workplace. He believes that
this apathy is, in part, due to the lack of visibility and communication by the
union to its members. He also feels that another communication pitfall in the
union is between the area representative and the upper leadership causing
important issues, such as the implementation of Teamwork, to never even having
been communicated or discussed between them. Whatever the case may be about the
union leadership, both Eric and Roger recognize the need for an active
membership to make the union strong. </p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span></span>The unions participation and
visibility in the custodial workplace, past and currently, seems to be lacking.
Neither Eric nor Cindy feels that the union has caused any real improvements in
their jobs. As far as the Teamwork issue is concerned, Eric and Cindy both
say that the Local union has taken a stand against it, but has told the members
that it is out of their hands to stop it. When asked about filing grievances,
Eric said he once filed one, but that nothing came of it. He feels now that if
a problem or conflict arouse he would go to human resources before going to his
steward, believing that he would get better results from human resources. Cindy
has never had to file a grievance, but also feels she would go to human
resources before going to her steward. Her hesitation about going to her
steward is prompted by the fact that her steward is also her worker lead, thus
she feels that the steward would be biased toward her supervisor and
management. She does not like that her steward is a lead and is perturbed by
the fact that her steward was not voted on  unlike past stewards. Roger agrees
that the union should be more visible in the workplace, but he feels that since
he started working, the union has become more accessible. He told me that when
he first started his job that he did not even know his steward. Roger also
expressed a strong, personal dedication to stopping Teamwork, saying that he
would be willing to go to the upper union leadership and upper management
himself to petition against it. Roger gave me the impression that he files many
grievances in order to keep his supervisor and management in check. He admits
that the grievances rarely ever come to a satisfactory end and that this is
because the union does not keep grievances on file to be used as collaboration.
Thus, the grievance becomes the employees word against managements word, with
management usually getting the benefit of the doubt. He said he would not go to
human resources about a problem, because he feels that they are too connected
with the management to be unbiased. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.6in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The union seems to communicate to its
custodial members in four main ways: postings in the workplace, petitions,
newsletters, and meetings. The postings hang next to the timecard clock and
inform members on upcoming meetings, events, and important issues that the
union is dealing with. Only Roger mentioned the postings, suggesting that they
are not that visible or informative to members. Cindy spoke of signing
petitions that are sent around by the union, most particularly the ones leading
up to last years strike.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems as if
most of the petitions are for legislative purposes that, with the high
percentage of minority and non-English speaking workers, might go unnoticed or
ignored for lack of the ability to read or understand them. WFSE sends out a
newsletter informing members on mostly legislative issues that the union is
handling. Both Eric and Cindy skim through the newsletters looking for
information that specifically applies to them, but they do not read the all the
articles and do not seem to fully understand or have knowledge of what the
union is doing in the state legislature. The meetings are held once a month at
seven in the evening at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Harborview</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Cindy says she
would go to the meetings if she could, but she is unable to, because she has to
stay home with her children in the evening and get up early for work, which
starts at five am. She said that at one time the union held women-only meetings
on campus during her work hours and the supervisors would give the women an
hour off to attend them, which she did until they ended. Roger encourages
members to attend meetings, he explains to them that with more member support
at meetings, it is easier to present issues and implement solutions. He said
that for a while he tried holding meetings on the campus during the custodians
lunch break, but that the members complained that it was taking away their
lunch time.</p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Communication with immigrants seems to
pose a difficult challenge to the union. Roger tells me that the union
leadership, which is also highly diverse, recognizes the extreme multiplicity
of its members and has been concentrating on how to fully include all members
in the union. One of the obstacles he feels in communicating with immigrants is
that many of them come from countries that do not have a favorable view of
unions and many of these immigrants do not fully understand the protection
given by unions. Thus, some immigrants are wary of the union for fear of
angering their supervisor or even losing their job. The language barrier makes
it even harder for immigrants to understand the benefits of the union and
participate in union activities.</p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The local union, rather than giving
its members insurance, monetary benefits, or recognition awards, tries to
reward and engage them through events and small gifts. The members receive all
their health insurance and pension benefits through the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Washington</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,
which does not seem to be a problem for the members I interviewed. Eric and
Cindy do, however, feel that the union could do more to acknowledge the members
importance to the union. Eric says that all the union has given to him, as a
member, has been a pin and a hat. Cindy says that the union holds about one
picnic in the summer and about two banquets during the year, with one of these
being a Christmas party. She seems to be only mildly impressed by these events.</p>

margin-left:.6in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>One unusual event that was held last
year was the one-day strike. Roger considered the strike to have been more like
a picnic rather than a true strike. He feels that for a strike to be really
successful that it must be spontaneous and bring operations to a stand still,
but he does not feel that striking is a good negotiating tool to use in general
because it hurts members. However, he admits that last years strike increased
membership, solidarity among members, visibility for the union, and helped in
the Legislature. Cindy participated in the strike last year as a way to make
management aware of its limits and also to show her support for the issue of
pay raises. She said that members did receive a slight pay raise following the
strike and were supposed to get a second pay raise, but the legislation for it
did not pass. Eric said he participated in the strike to support his coworkers,
but did not feel strongly about the issues. He did not say whether the strike
helped at all, but did say he lost a days pay and his perfect attendance. </p>

differs in their opinions on what they would like for the future of WFSE Local
1488. Eric believes that the union is on its way out and thinks that the <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Washington</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> should subcontract a
custodial service that might have better managerial skills. Cindy wants the
union to become more involved in the workplace, especially with such issues as
Teamwork, and to become more accessible to members. She would also like to
see union meetings at the workplace again and possibly more union sponsored
events. Furthermore, she thinks that the union should give out awards to
longtime members and for other contributions by members. Roger feels that in
order for the union to become strong again in its ability to pass legislation,
to effectively bargain on their behalf, and to gain greater support in the
workplace that it must organize a larger, more active membership. He has ambitiously
set out to build this membership by planning to hold more community events and
safety meetings in the upcoming months to make the union more visible to all
its members and less frightening to immigrant members. Right now, he says he
goes around to individual members  especially immigrants  talking to them
about the union and how their participation is important. He also has plans to
try the lunch meetings again, this time having them be catered. In addition, he
wants to move the postings board that is currently next to the timecard clock
out into a public place on campus, so that all the members plus university
students, faculty, and staff can find out about some of the WFSE issues. To
improve the grievance processes, he wants the union to start keeping track of
grievance and forming case studies on particular managers or problems, thus
making future grievances stronger and more likely to produce results. Roger's
final comment to me was, The pack is back! reflecting his optimism and
excitement about increasing member participation and WFSE Local 1488s
strength.</p>
