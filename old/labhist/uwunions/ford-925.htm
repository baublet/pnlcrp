			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEIU 925 is an 
			organizing union, which means that it relies on its members to 
			maintain and build the union.&nbsp; Therefore, in the purist sense, the 
			members are the union.&nbsp; Moreover, the people that truly are the 
			backbone of SEIU 925 are the shop stewards.&nbsp; Stewards are 
			volunteers; they receive no pay and little compensation beyond a pat 
			on the back and well-deserved pride in a job well done.&nbsp; At most, 
			they receive paid release time from their regular work so that they 
			may attend to their duties as stewards.&nbsp; The amount of release time 
			they may use is determined by the union’s contract.&nbsp; Yet, the 
			majority of their work takes place during breaks and lunches.&nbsp; As we 
			will see, it is their hard work that encourages others to become 
			involved, thus continuing the cycle.&nbsp; In large part, it is their 
			hard work that has brought success to SEIU 925.</span></p>

			stories are very similar, as they are all the product of the same 
			union and abide by the style adopted by SEIU 925.&nbsp; However, we will 
			also see divergence in their style and how they interpret their 
			role.</span></p>

			workplace issues instigated Jeneil’s becoming a steward, though for 
			more direct purposes.&nbsp; The staff lost a previously supportive 
			supervisor, and many within the office were unhappy with the new 
			management’s top-down approach; thus, she decided to pursue a 
			position as a steward.&nbsp; She felt that it would be good to have 
			someone in the area that knew more about the contract.&nbsp; Since then, 
			she has been a member of the negotiating team and is a member of the

			couldn’t do it, when asked, because of time constraints and other 
			timing issues.&nbsp; Then, a steward left to work in another UW

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a steward, Julie 
			provides a support role for the employees under her sphere.&nbsp; When 
			called upon regarding a workplace grievance, she first meets with 
			the coworker to get a feel for the situation.&nbsp; She needs to make 
			sure that the issue at hand is a valid grievance.&nbsp; She feels it is 
			her responsibility to be up front and honest, and will explain to 
			the coworker why the issue can or cannot be pursued.&nbsp; Then, her 
			primary goal is to diffuse and resolve the situation at the lowest 
			level possible, avoiding escalation of the issue.&nbsp; She feels that 
			doing so is a benefit to everyone involved.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Knowing the contract is key, for 
			it is her tool when working with management.&nbsp; It is to this document 
			that she will first refer coworkers, and work from herself, 
			suggesting that they cite an apposite section.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">A great part of her role is to 
			provide an experienced, outside person to whom the grievant can look 
			for support.&nbsp; These situations can be very difficult and she finds 
			that her poise, presence, and wealth of experience are as 
			emotionally invaluable to the employee as the contribution she might 
			directly make to the situation.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Jeneil is sometimes called

			calls are regarding disciplinary meetings; a few involve grievances.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Her first step is to talk with 
			the person about the issue, paying attention to fairness, looking 
			for direct contract violations, and finding out what the member 
			wants to do.&nbsp; Sometimes they just want to find out if management was 
			right or wrong and do not want to take it further.&nbsp; Often they are 
			returnees, people who had elected to not take action before, but are 
			now prepared to go the next step.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">If the person does want to 
			proceed, she will then look to see what contract articles are 
			violated and then schedules a meeting with management.&nbsp; In dealing 
			with management, she works on resolving the issue at the lowest 
			level possible, without including human resources.&nbsp; Thus, she tries 
			to avoid the grievance procedure, as they take a long time and it is 
			in the best interests of everyone if the issue doesn’t escalate.&nbsp; 
			Often, she finds that the matter is merely the result of a 
			misunderstanding.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a steward, Dean 
			often sees his work as “facilitating better communication” between 
			employee and employer.&nbsp; The members under his purview work in Region 
			17; this geographic region encompasses most of West Campus, 
			Roosevelt offices, and Fremont.&nbsp; As a matter of principle, he does 
			not represent employees within the law school, for he feels this 
			would be a potential conflict of interest.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Dean believes that many workplace 
			issues boil down to communication.&nbsp; For example, he once counseled 
			an employee who had not talked with her supervisor over a rather 
			long period of time.&nbsp; The employee and the supervisor had been 
			funneling communicating through a third party.&nbsp; Dean asked the 
			employee to please immediately make an appointment to talk with the 
			supervisor.&nbsp; In the end, this was a very good approach with a 
			positive outcome.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Sometimes it is his

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the circumstances

			they said to her.&nbsp; It is better now; they respect her.&nbsp; Yet, it 
			isn’t really friendly, though that’s not what she would want.&nbsp; 
			Management thinks more before they do something, and they’re not

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">One case demonstrating this is 
			when the employees needed a room in which to meet with union 
			representatives.&nbsp; These meeting always take place during break times 
			and the contract provides for these meetings to be held on the 
			premises.&nbsp; At first, when the workers requested the use of a 
			conference room, management turned it down, thinking that it was not 
			appropriate.&nbsp; Then, after considering the situation, Jeneil and the 
			others insisted upon using the conference room and the management 
			subsequently signed off on it.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">She especially believes that

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Some of her coworkers were 
			adversely affected, as they received letters of reprimand for 
			participating.&nbsp; She says that this is a matter of contention before 
			the union.&nbsp; She herself did not receive one, as the strike worked in 
			with time for which she had already arranged to be gone from work.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeneil went out on 
			strike with several in her department.&nbsp; Like many people who were 
			gone that day, she received a letter of reprimand.&nbsp; These were 
			generic, form letters sent down by the hospital administration.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">The hospital administration’s 
			reasoning was that it affected patient care and that it was improper 
			use of vacation time, however letters were issued whether or not 
			this was true, and even when employees had pre-arranged to be gone 
			with their supervisors.&nbsp; It didn’t even matter if they were at the 
			strike or not, out on sick leave, or were using vacation time 
			‘legitimately’.&nbsp; In one case, a supervisor had OK’d an employee’s 
			leave ahead of time, and then when the supervisor was instructed to 
			give the employee the letter, the supervisor followed up the letter 
			of reprimand with another letter explaining why she felt that the 
			disciplinary action was wrong.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">She picketed at the hospital, 
			mainly the east and west gates.&nbsp; The picketers included four or five 
			other unions, and she felt it was successful in creating public 
			awareness.&nbsp; On a different occasion she participated in 
			‘Informational Unity Breaks’ in which she and others handed out 
			pamphlets during their breaks to stopped cars.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Though he did not go out for the

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being on the contract 
			negotiating committee gives Jeneil a unique perspective into what 
			she would like to see changed.&nbsp; In particular, she is in charge of 
			updating the section that dealt with disciplinary actions.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Beyond clarifying the wording of 
			this section, she would like to see a few structural changes.&nbsp; 
			Primarily, she wants to see implemented a time frame for 
			disciplinary action on the part of management.&nbsp; After the strike, 
			some employees received letters of reprimand months after the fact; 
			this was unreasonable and unfair, and she would like to see such 
			action prohibited.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">For Dean, there was no contract 
			issue for which he felt particularly strong, though he did provide 
			his input via the survey the union distributed.&nbsp; At this point, he 
			is most wary of ‘take aways’, as he doesn’t want to see the 
			employees lose ground they have thus far fought to gain.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Especially pertinent to her job, 
			Julie would like to see the wording of the contract tightened up.&nbsp; 
			It is natural that the employees and employers will interpret the 
			wording differently, but she thinks it can be improved.&nbsp; Given that 
			it is so important to her as a tool when working with management, 
			she wants less room for interpretation and the requisite clarity in 
			communication with management that would follow.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Cost-of-living raises would be 
			good.&nbsp; She is also unhappy with the trend towards rising health 
			insurance premiums.&nbsp; Additionally, she feels that there are problems 
			with the restrictions on usage of sick leave.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean points out that 
			the union is only as strong as its members, and feels that sometimes 
			the membership loses sight of this.&nbsp; He also believes that everyone 
			needs an advocate and encourages organizing efforts.&nbsp; It is “good to 
			know we don’t work in isolation,” he says, “we all bring strengths 
			and weaknesses [to the workplace], which can also be a positive 
			thing.”</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a member of various 
			committees, Jeneil assures that what needs to be improved is being 
			worked on, mainly, communication to the members.&nbsp; They are spread 
			out, and a member that is across the city needs to receive 
			information and support.&nbsp; To do so, they are utilizing the Internet, 
			mail, one-on-one attention, and working towards increasing the 
			steward to member ratio.&nbsp; Lab medicine effectively has one steward 
			for twenty-five members, however some areas don’t have a steward on 
			hand.</span></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana">She also feels that the union 
			needs to expand into Eastern Washington.&nbsp; State politics are 
			increasingly important to the union’s goals, and therefore it is 
			imperative that they have a larger, more expansive base.</span></p>

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">One of her favorite parts of 
			being a steward is the teacher-like effect she gets sometime.&nbsp; For
