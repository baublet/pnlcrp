	The organization of a TA union on the University of Washington campus began 
	early in 1998.&nbsp; During winter quarter of that year, a group of students from 
	the Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) formed a committee to 
	review the TA/RA (research assistant) experience at the UW and to address TA 
	complaints about work overload, low wages and a lack of security regarding 
	benefits.<a title name="_ednref1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[i]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	According to Roberta Gold, a founding member of GSEAC, an incident in the 
	History department was one of the prompting factors. A TA was removed from 
	his teaching position by the department chair after a verbal dispute with a 
	faculty member.&nbsp; The TA received the message on his answering machine and 
	was mortified to learn that he had been effectively terminated from his 
	position without being allowed to present his side of the story.<a title name="_ednref2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[ii]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	After hearing the TA’s account, the department chair reinstated the TA, and 
	by doing so acknowledged that the decision to terminate was too hastily 
	made. This incident understandably raised concern among many graduate 
	students.&nbsp; Graduate students in the Geography and History department 
	responded by meeting together to discuss the possibilities of unionizing in 
	order to address conditions of employment and long-standing grievances.<a title name="_ednref3" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[iii]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Students in the History Department&nbsp; resurrected the Graduate Liaison 
	Committee (GLC), a departmental organization that acts as an advocate for 
	graduate student opinion.&nbsp; However, members of the GLC realized that they 
	could not do much from a legal standpoint in their attempts to settle TA/RA 
	grievances or in their push for better benefits.&nbsp; &quot;It was decided that if 
	graduate students were to have a practical say in terms of employment, then 
	a real union was needed,&quot; said Gold.&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 5pt">
	The realization that a union was required to address long-standing TA/RA 
	grievances lead members of the GPSS TA/RA Committee and graduate students 
	from the History and Geography departments to form GSEAC.&nbsp; In order to avoid 
	endangering unionization efforts in its infancy, GSEAC registered itself as 
	an Registered Student Organization (RSO), for the purpose of working against 
	shrinking TA/RA benefits, getting more sovereignty in government and 
	encouraging dialogue among TA's and RA's.<a title name="_ednref4" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[iv]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In the spring of 1998, Mary Wheeler – a doctoral candidate from the 
	University of Michigan where TA's are unionized – spoke at a GPSS forum 
	about TA/RA issues.&nbsp; During the forum, GPSS president Tina Kotek said that 
	UW TAs do not plan to organize but that their wages are lower than peers at 
	comparable institutions.&nbsp; GSEAC members began suggesting efforts to unionize 
	Campus TAs.&nbsp; UW President Richard McCormick dismissed the idea, stating that 
	&quot;graduate students are first and foremost students&quot; and &quot;graduate student 
	employees' employment status is derived from their education status and 
	would suggest it is inappropriate for students to seek unionization.&quot;<a title name="_ednref5" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[v]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<span style="color: black">&quot;What got the ball rolling [toward unionization] 
	was a change in insurance plan for grad students,&quot; said Gold.&nbsp; In the fall 
	of 1998, the plan was changed without any notification. Graduate students 
	were simply told that they would now be required to pay part of the costs of 
	their health insurance plan.&nbsp; Some students, who had incurred health-related 
	expenses, thought they were receiving full coverage only to find out too 
	late that the coverage had been changed.&nbsp; The GPSS appointed a committee to 
	investigate the health insurance plan but found itself helpless to change 
	what had happened or prevent such things from happening again.&nbsp; Many grad 
	students now decided&nbsp; “that a union was essential,” said Gold.<a title name="_ednref6" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[vi]</span></span></a>

	<span style="color: black">During Spring Quarter 1999, GSEAC staged its the 
	first public event to get TA’s and RA’s interested in unionizing.&nbsp; Around 
	this time, an organizational structure in GSEAC began to take shape in the 
	form of an eight-member steering committee.&nbsp; This body met on a weekly 
	basis, took responsibility in arranging and scheduling meetings, recruiting 
	organizers and worked to organize a campaign drive for unionization. The 
	first GSEAC Steering Committee was made up of the following members and 
	their respective departments:&nbsp; Kenneth Lang, Roberta Gold, Steven Marquart 
	of History, Amy Freeman and Rich Heyman of Geography, Heather Easterling of 
	English, Ron Aoyama of Philosophy and Christopher Hibbeln of Psychology.&nbsp; 
	Another event that caught the attention of GSEAC was when the Graduate 
	School considered a proposal to change the system of standardized wages for 
	TAs, introducing different rates for some departments.&nbsp; This unequal pay 
	raise and the fact that studies showed that at the UW, TAs receive 3.1 
	percent less in wages than TAs at peer institutions, led GSEAC to be even 
	more determined to unionize and to get backing from an established major 
	union.<a title name="_ednref7" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[vii]</span></span></a></span></p>

	In the fall of 1999, GSEAC made the decision to affiliate with the United 
	Auto Workers (UAW). “The UAW was a clear choice for GSEAC in that the UAW 
	would be able to provide the union with reliable support,” said Gold.<a title name="_ednref8" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[viii]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	A big factor was UAW's role in the long campaign for unionization of TAs in 
	the University of California system. The Association of Graduate Student 
	Employees (AGSE)&nbsp; at Berkeley won a &nbsp;representation election for readers, 
	tutors, and acting instructors with an 80-percent majority in the spring of 
	1993. But the UC administration went to court, refusing to deal with the 
	union. Also in the spring of 1993, a majority of student academic employees 
	at UC Davis formed a union and a majority of readers, tutors, and acting 
	instructors at UC San Diego join AGSE/UAW there – organizing then followed 
	suit at UC Los Angeles and UC Santa Barbara. Finally after a multiyear 
	campaign the University agreed to bargain. In spring 2000, AGSE/UAW&nbsp; 
	ratified their first system wide contract by a 93-percent margin.&nbsp; The 
	settlement, 17 years in the making, provided pay raises, tuition rebates, 
	full health care coverage, job security, and basic union protections to 
	10,000 teaching assistants, readers, and tutors in UAW locals at all eight 
	UC campuses.<a title name="_ednref9" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[ix]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The success AGSE/UAW in California was encouraging and led GSEAC into 
	affiliating with the UAW for financial and moral support.<span style="color: black">

	<span style="color: black">The UAW provided GSEAC with office space 
	off-campus and training for professional organizing.&nbsp; Two graduate students 
	were selected by the GSEAC Steering Committee to become staff organizers, 
	meaning that they would not teach or do research work for the quarters they 
	were organizing but that the UAW would compensate for the pay and benefits 
	normally received in those positions.&nbsp; Kenneth Lang and Stephanie Burkhalter 
	became the first organizers for GSEAC, starting their work during Winter 
	Quarter 2000.&nbsp; At the time the UW administration was aware of GSEAC’s 
	existence as an RSO but the administration was completely unaware of the 
	card drive that GSEAC had kept quiet about.&nbsp; They had been using grassroots 
	organizing methods to avoid the use of e-mail, which helped prevent any 
	surveillance from happening<a title name="_ednref10" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt">[x]</span></span></a>.</span></p>

	<span style="color: black">During the process of organizing, it was 
	discovered that GSEAC </span><span style="color: black">already had support 
	in many departments all over campus. In January 2000, GSEAC began a card 
	drive to collected signed union representation </span>
	<span style="color: black">cards from teaching assistants authorizing GSEAC 
	to represent them. At</span> the end of Winter Quarter 2000, GSEAC submitted 
	signed union cards representing over 80 percent of the UW's 1,650 
	graduate-student teaching assistants, readers and tutors to the state's 
	Public Employee Relations Commission (PERC). PERC is a Washington State 
	agency that oversees labor relations for government employees.&nbsp; By the time 
	of the card drive, undergraduates as well as graduate students were joining 
	GSEAC/UAW because of awareness that many worked in the same jobs as graduate 
	students: as teaching assistants, readers, graders, and tutors. GSEAC/UAW 
	asked that it be allowed to represent TA/RAs in contract negotiations with 
	the university in a letter on 15 March 2000, sent to President McCormick and 
	PERC requesting legal recognition.<a title name="_ednref11" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xi]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In order for this to happen, the UW needed to release a list of employees 
	that PERC could compare with the cards signed by the student employees, but 
	the University refused to do so.&nbsp; Although PERC accepted the cards, the 
	university refused to agree to PERC jurisdiction. According to Karen 
	Kavanagh, UW vice president for human relations, the UW sent a letter on 25 
	March 2000 to PERC indicating that the organization needed more information 
	regarding the legal framework under which PERC will consider the GSEAC 
	petition.<a title name="_ednref12" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xii]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	&quot;This is a complex issue because there seems to be no state law on 
	collective bargaining - and this involves student employment,&quot; she said.<a title name="_ednref13" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xiii]</span></span></a></p>

	Kavenaugh sent another letter dated 22 March 2000 saying that the UW was 
	comfortable with the GPSS being the voice for graduate students, regardless 
	of GSEAC.&nbsp; However, PERC Executive Director Marvin Schurke said he never 
	received any letter sent by the UW.&nbsp; GSEAC member Christopher Hibbeln said 
	the GPSS is useful as a student government body to address concerns, but the 
	UW is not legally bound by GPSS resolutions.&nbsp; &quot;But if GSEAC has the 
	authority to collectively bargain and create a legal contract, the UW is 
	bound to that contract,&quot; he said.<a title name="_ednref14" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xiv]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	GSEAC said it received no response from the UW administration following the 
	card drive but had a letter from the UW sent to a UAW California branch for 
	unknown reasons.&nbsp; Washington State has no legislation that compels the 
	university to recognize collective bargaining rights of academic employees 
	at 4-year institutions. &nbsp;The same goes on the federal level with the 1935 
	Wagner Act, which provides collective bargaining rights to private sector 
	employees but does not cover public employees.</p>

	GSEAC asked that the University respect the wishes of their employees (as 
	expressed in the card signatures) and recognize GSEAC/UAW as the sole 
	bargaining agent, but the University refused .&nbsp; &quot;I would rather that you 
	didn't organize a union.&nbsp; I think we can achieve the goals collegially 
	through existing methods,&quot; said McCormick at a GPSS meeting 16 April 2000, 
	citing task forces and legislative lobbying as possible ways to give 
	teaching assistants, readers and graders the pay compensation and 
	health-care benefits.<a title name="_ednref15" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xv]</span></span></a> 
	He repeated this same stance in an open letter printed in <i>The Daily </i>
	on 24 April, insisting that the UW must remain &quot;competitive&quot; in order to 
	maintain the highest quality of education available.<a title name="_ednref16" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xvi]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	But a counter letter, written by GSEAC committee member Freeman said, 
	&quot;McCormick feels that unions are somehow inherently adversarial.&nbsp; Yet, it is 
	only because the UW is unwilling to cooperate with GSEAC/UAW that it risks 
	recreating the long and costly adversarial situation that occurred between 
	the graduate student employee union and the administration at the University 
	of California,&quot; and he also cited that there were at least 26 recognized 
	unions on university campuses in the United States and that the UW has no 
	reason not to follow this trend.<a title name="_ednref17" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xvii]</span></span></a></p>

	At a 15 May 2000 GPSS meeting, McCormick offered to form a committee 
	dedicated solely to addressing graduate student issues in lieu of 
	unionization, but was rejected by the GPSS executive board.&nbsp; &quot;We cannot, in 
	good faith, honor both tracks.&nbsp; If we were to serve on this committee, we 
	would be betraying our commitment to graduate students and [would] undermine 
	our unionization,&quot; said GPSS secretary Jamie Clausen concerning McCormick's 
	offer.<a title name="_ednref18" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xviii]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	&quot;I'm not under the illusion that this will dissuade you from unionizing – 
	you'll do that anyway,&quot; McCormick said, claiming that his offer wasn't in 
	response to the union, but to the administration's poor job handling 
	graduate student issues,&nbsp; &quot;This isn't a replacement, but you haven't got a 
	union yet.&quot;<a title name="_ednref19" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xix]</span></span></a></p>

	The UW's refusal to recognize GSEAC was because University officials – who 
	hired outside attorneys to handle the case – were confident that there was 
	no legislation or legal precedent that existed that would allow the union to 
	collectively bargain for wages and benefits, and they knew that getting new 
	legislation through Olympia could be a long shot knowing that bills that 
	would have given collective-bargaining rights to UW faculty have failed 
	since the 1970s. &nbsp;GSEAC criticized the school for using outside legal help, 
	calling it a waste of public resources. Norm Arkans, executive director of 
	university relations, said it is standard practice for the state Attorney 
	General's Office – which acts as legal counsel for state agencies – to 
	retain outside attorneys in cases involving specialty law and that it only 
	cost $458 to do so. &quot;The administration has clearly made the choice to fight 
	this, and they've made it clear the route they've chosen is litigation,

	On May 23, 2000 GSEAC/UAW received news that the official authorization card 
	tally from a second Union Card drive held had determined that 84 percent of 
	TAs/RAs voted in support of unionization.&nbsp; &quot;It's a huge victory,&quot; said 
	GSEAC/UAW organizer Ken Lang who also said the UW's refusal to recognize the 
	union is intended to deny &quot;us, as employees, to have an actual meaningful 
	voice.&quot;&nbsp; However, the UW refused to allow PERC to oversee the card tally so 
	a third party, the Reverend John Boostra, was selected to oversee the 
	count.&nbsp; When asked to comment, McCormick replied &quot;[We are] very serious 
	about addressing the concerns and needs of graduate students but not through 
	GSEAC/UAW.&quot;<a title name="_ednref21" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xxi]</span></span></a></p>

	State representative Frank Chopp, D-Seattle; Rick Bender of the Washington 
	state Labor Council (WLC); and Steve Williamson, executive director of the 
	King County Labor Council (KCLC) all pledged solidarity with GSEAC/UAW.&nbsp; 
	Rep. Phyllis Kenney, D-Seattle, co-chair of the state House Higher Education 
	Committee refuted the University’s stance on graduate students’ position in 
	that they are students, not employees.&nbsp; “Students are hired to do a job.&nbsp; 
	Your job is to pay for your education.&nbsp; But whatever your role, you are

	The support from major figures continued with Jesse Jackson’s endorsement of 
	GSEAC’s effort to unionize on 31 October 2000 during a campaign stop for Al 
	Gore. During the week of 31 October to 3 November 2000, GSEAC held a 
	weeklong strike vote during which 86 percent of 1,148 TAs voted in favor of 
	a strike should the UW continue to disregard their union.&nbsp; On 14 November at 
	the UW Faculty Senate meeting, passed a resolution urging the administration 
	to begin bargaining with GSEAC/UAW.&nbsp; President McCormick announces that the 
	UW will support TA unionization but not without prior “enabling legislation” 
	that would define TAs as employees and allow them to collectively bargain 
	with the Board of Regents.<a title name="_ednref24" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xxiv]</span></span></a></p>

	On 27 November, in reaction to McCormick’s response, GSEAC/UAW set the 
	strike date for 4 December at midnight if UW administration refuses 
	voluntary recognition.&nbsp; On 1 December, President McCormick sent out a mass 
	e-mail stating that he wanted to work with GSEAC/UAW to convince the 
	legislature to pass collective-bargaining legislation.&nbsp; McCormick said that 
	the university would bargain with GSEAC/UAW once the law was changed..<a title name="_ednref25" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xxv]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	On 3 December, McCormick said “[The administration] recognizes that the TAs 
	want a union.&nbsp; We accept that and respect their choice.&nbsp; We will cheerfully 
	recognize and bargain with GSEAC/UAW once legislation is in hand.”<a title name="_ednref26" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[xxvi]</span></span></a>

	This was only the start of the campaign to achieve full recognition for 
	GSEAC/UAW by the UW.&nbsp; TAs would go on strike in June 2001 after the 
	legislative session ended without new collective bargaining legislation.&nbsp; 
	The strike did not produce any settlement between UW and GSEAC. But the next 
	year the legislature passed House Bill 1464&nbsp; and Senate Bill 5826 
	authorizing collective bargaining for UW employees who are enrolled in 
	academic programs.&nbsp; </p>
