&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first day of June in 2001 saw the beginning of a fifteen-day 
strike by the Academic Student Employees (teaching assistants, readers, graders, 
and tutors) at the University of Washington.&nbsp; This strike was led by GSEAC 
(Graduate Student Employee Action Coalition), who is affiliated with the United 
Auto Workers (UAW), and claimed to represent 1,600 academic student employees 
(ASE).&nbsp; The strike disrupted the last two weeks of the spring academic quarter 
and left professors and the University Administration grappling for ways to be 
able to read all of the final papers and tests and then to distribute grades in 
a timely and fair manner.&nbsp; What follows is a discussion of the events leading up 
to the strike and also of the strike itself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
<b><u>Why Strike?</u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The University of Washington campus is home to 3,700 ASE (academic 
student employees).&nbsp; In March of 2000, 80% of the ASE voted to be represented by 
GSEAC.&nbsp; GSEAC, in affiliation with the UAW, attempted to ratify an agreement 
with the University that would make it the exclusive bargaining unit for wage 
negotiations, benefits, job security and working conditions on campus.&nbsp; At this 
time, the ASE claimed to be responsible for fifty percent of the teaching going 
on at the University but was compensated for far less.&nbsp; Student employees had no 
job security and no guaranteed contract to assure them of their jobs.&nbsp; Graduate 
students wanted the stability of a guaranteed living wage, medical benefits, and 
improved working conditions that did not take advantage of their vulnerability 
as students.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the University was willing to promise these things 
in faith only and this was unacceptable to almost all ASE working on campus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The University was first confronted with the possibility of a strike 
in 2000.&nbsp; This prompted a sudden willingness on the part of the University to 
talk with student employees about certain labor issues such as wage negotiation 
and better benefits.&nbsp; The University, however, was unwilling to talk to any 
group affiliating with the UAW and they would not grant exclusive bargaining 
rights to GSEAC.&nbsp; The University hoped that the GSEAC/UAW alliance was not 
strong enough to create the mandates that they were requesting.&nbsp; By sidestepping 
the Union and offering only some of what was being asked for by student 
employees, the University Administration hoped to maintain control of this 
particular facet of labor on campus – they did not succeed.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
On October 31, 2000 GSEAC members voted 984-164 to authorize a strike if the 
University failed to recognize the Union and extend it collective-bargaining 
rights. As the strike date neared, the University Administration feared the 
consequences and struck a deal with GSEAC/UAW to pursue legislature that would 
make GSEAC/UAW the sole representatives for Graduate Students at the University 
of Washington.&nbsp; This deal served to postpone the possibility of a strike in the 
winter of 2000.&nbsp; GSEAC members were hopeful that the University would work with 
them and that legislation would pass that would allow the University to 
recognize them.&nbsp; Furthermore, it was the first time that the University 
Administration recognized GSEAC as representatives of the student employees 
working on campus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the deal, GSEAC agreed that they would not strike until the 
legislation was decided on.&nbsp; Unfortunately, things did not run smoothly in 
Olympia and the legislation died before it came to a vote.&nbsp; Without the 
legislation, the two sides were again at an impasse.&nbsp; The University 
Administration claimed that without the legislation, they could not authorize 
exclusive collective-bargaining rights to GSEAC.&nbsp; GSEAC claimed that this is not 
necessarily the case and that the University was just using this excuse as a way 
of stalling and not having to recognize the union.&nbsp; GSEAC declared that it does 
not explicitly state in the Washington State's Constitution that without 
legislation the University could not hand over exclusive bargaining rights to 
GSEAC.&nbsp; If the University wanted to recognize the Union, they could do so and 
that it did not need legislation to do so.&nbsp; At this point, GSEAC took a vote and 
agreed to extend a strike date to one week before Spring Term finals.&nbsp; If the 
Administration would not come to an agreement by this date, the graduate 
students were going on strike. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GSEAC bargaining committee and University Representatives met 
several times during the next couple of months but no agreement was reached.&nbsp; 
The University continued their anti-strike propaganda by stating that they would 
be willing to negotiate with students about wages and benefits, and that it was 
in fact GSEAC that was unwilling to compromise.&nbsp; The University Administration 
stated that their hands were tied without legislation, and that it would not be 
legal to grant exclusive bargaining rights to GSEAC/UAW without it.&nbsp; GSEAC was 
not moved by the Universities position, and in a grand show of solidarity they 
voted to strike with 93% of the turnout in favor of striking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 11<sup>th</sup> GSEAC had a second strike vote which prevailed 
by a vote of 1,061-100 in favor of a strike. GSEAC’s negotiating committee, 
which comprised of five members, decided that June 1st would be the date the 
strike would begin.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the major obstacle that kept the two 
sides apart was the disagreement over whether or not the University had the 
right and/or ability to acknowledge GSEAC as the sole representative of all of 
the student employees and grant it collective bargaining rights.&nbsp; Kristin 
Intemann, a member of the negotiating committee stated, “The Union will not 
settle without a collective bargaining agreement.&nbsp; If we did settle, student 
employees could fall prey to the whim of the Administration.”&nbsp; The student 
employees did not want to strike but as they saw it, they had no other choice.&nbsp; 
Melissa Gjellstad, a TA in the Department of Scandinavian Studies put the issue 
in perspective in her statement, “Nobody wants to go out on strike, but we’re 
all willing to do it if the terms of a fully enforceable contract aren’t met by 
the bargaining teams.” A strike during spring finals would make grading 
difficult for the university and disrupt final exams.&nbsp; The committee realized 
that students would be hurt in the process of the strike, but they felt that it 
was a necessary loss to gain long-standing stability for all academic student 
employees.&nbsp; Graduating students would be hit the hardest.&nbsp; If their final grades 
were not processed, they would be unable to graduate.&nbsp; The GSEAC committee felt 
that these were unfortunate but worthwhile and necessary hardships that would 
have to be faced.&nbsp; They felt bad for the students but they also hoped that the 
students would understand and support their cause.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the strike, GSEAC saw support from other areas besides their 
own rank and file.&nbsp; There was constant picketing on all three campuses (Seattle, 
Bothell, and Tacoma) and many teachers honored the picket lines of the graduate 
students, showing their support for what the student employees were trying to 
accomplish.&nbsp; Metro Bus Drivers did not drive buses onto campus through the 
duration of the strike as their union wanted to show solidarity with and support 
of GSEAC and its strike.&nbsp;&nbsp; Truck drivers and construction workers also refused 
to come onto campus as well, and as it can easily be imagined, this created 
serious delays on construction projects in the University.&nbsp; All of these factors 
helped to show the solidarity of the strikers and to put more pressure on the 
University to come to terms with the GSEAC negotiating committee.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of the strike was widely felt through the different 
University programs, but the College of Arts and Sciences was hit the hardest.&nbsp; 
It is comprised of 42 departments that teach 21,000 undergraduates and employ 
two thirds of the university’s teaching assistants.&nbsp; Furthermore, two of the 
foreign-language divisions were forced to cancel their finals.&nbsp; The English and 
History departments, which relied heavily on TA's to give and grade essay exams 
were equally disabled.&nbsp; Some students who were expecting essay exams were given 
multiple-choice tests.&nbsp; This upset many students, “If you’re taking a class in 
U.S. history and you’re expecting to write an essay to show your knowledge, 
you’re going to be a little upset if you’re suddenly given a multiple-choice 
test,” ASUW President Jasmine Weaver told the Seattle Times, “It just doesn’t 
reveal what students have learned as well” </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some teachers, in a show of solidarity, were not willing to do the 
work that the TA's were supposed to do for by doing so, it would have 
symbolically meant crossing the picket line which is something a number of them 
were not willing to do.&nbsp; Other teachers complied with University demands that it 
was their job to do the work, whether it was originally designated for TA’s or 
not.&nbsp; All of the graduate students did not go on strike, however, as many of the 
TA’s in the science departments chose not to walk out. &nbsp;The science and math 
departments pay their TA’s higher wages than other departments, and because of 
this disparity of wages between departments, many of the higher paid TA’s did 
not feel that the University was treating them unfairly.&nbsp; A group of TA’s from 
the chemistry department refused to strike and went as far as to form an 
opposition group called, Graduate Students for Informed Choices on 
Unionization.&nbsp; This group worked to try and stop the UAW involvement on campus.&nbsp; 
The opposition group however, did not diminish the strength of the strike.&nbsp; For 
two weeks, strikers picketed outside the University every day, drawing honks of 
support from drivers passing bye.&nbsp; Picketers sang Union songs and were jubilant 
and very noticeable to the eye of the general public.&nbsp; </p>

The GSEAC bargaining committee was comprised of five people elected by the 
membership at a GSEAC election meeting.&nbsp; This team met regularly with the 
University Administration to try and resolve strike issues so that student 
employees could get back to work.&nbsp; Had an agreement been reached between the 
GSEAC bargaining committee and the University Administration it would have then 
been brought back to the union members for a vote.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the two sides 
were unable to compromise.&nbsp; They were still stuck on the issue of exclusive 
bargaining rights for GSEAC and a guaranteed contract.&nbsp; The University was 
willing to concede or negotiate on issues of pay, benefits and workload but were 
unwilling to bend when it came to exclusive bargaining rights.&nbsp; The refusal of 
the University to acknowledge GSEAC was unacceptable to the bargaining 
committee.&nbsp; They felt that to accept an agreement with the University without 
exclusive bargaining rights and a contract would have been a loss.&nbsp; This impasse 
created a stalemate in negotiations between the University Administration and 
the GSEAC bargaining committee, as neither side was willing to give ground.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The University carried on a public relations campaign to try to 
undermine support of the GSEAC Union effort.&nbsp; President McCormick and other 
officials were quoted several times by the press saying that they would agree to 
authorize higher pay and benefits to graduate workers but without legislation, 
they could not and would not give GSEAC exclusive bargaining rights.&nbsp; Not only 
was this not true, but it did little to sway the effort or the solidarity of the 
GSEAC strike.&nbsp; GSEAC had compiled union cards signed by 80 percent of all 
graduate student employees.&nbsp; Against normal union procedure, GSEAC offered these 
cards to the University Administration for examination and proof of support.&nbsp; 
The University did not dispute the support and solidarity of GSEAC but they 
still refused to budge from their stance.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the University was asking was for the GSEAC committee to take an 
advisory stance. This meant that the University would make all decisions 
concerning wages, medical benefits, workload, or any other labor related issue 
and that GSEAC would then be able to give input into the situation, but would 
have no real strength.&nbsp; This was obviously unacceptable for the GSEAC committee 
and they saw it as being a total loss if they were to agree to it.&nbsp; Had they 
agreed to it, student employees would still have been subject to any whim of the 
University Administration.&nbsp; The administration could raise wages one year and 
then lower them the next, and the student employees would have no organized body 
to take action on their behalf.&nbsp; A contract that acknowledged GSEAC as the sole 
bargaining agent for the student employees was what was needed in order to 
provide secure employment for graduate students and stop a strike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It became clear that neither side would be willing to budge, so the 
University Administration and the GSEAC negotiation committee agreed to allow a 
third party mediator to sit in on meetings.&nbsp; Both sides were optimistic that 
this third party would be able to shed new light on the issues at hand.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, the mediator had little effect.&nbsp; While the mediator brought the 
two sides closer on issues of wages they were unable to sway either side on the 
main issue at hand.&nbsp; GSEAC still demanded that the University agree to a fully 
enforceable contract and the University refused.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GSEAC strike lasted from June 1 to June 15, which was the end of 
spring quarter.&nbsp; The strike was successful in crippling the University’s ability 
to complete the academic grading for spring quarter as TA’s and graders are 
responsible for about half of the grading that is done during finals week.&nbsp; The 
University was unable to compensate for the loss of such a large workload and a 
year later, the University is still trying to complete some of the grades that 
should have been administered in the spring of 2001.&nbsp; Understandably, students 
who were graduating in the spring term of 2001, were very upset when they had to 
wait for diplomas because their final grades had not been processed.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: .6in; margin-right: 1.0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The graduate student strike of 2001 forced the University 
Administration into making a concerted effort to get a deal done that would 
prevent a similar strike from happening again in the future.&nbsp; Today, those 
efforts seemed to have paid off.&nbsp; UW President McCormick has taken a great deal 
of heat for putting a labor dispute before the needs of his undergraduate 
students.&nbsp; GSEAC is prepared to strike again if the workers needs are not met in 
the near future.&nbsp; They now have the know-how and the resources to stage a larger 
strike and cause further havoc for the University if it comes to it.&nbsp; Moreover, 
the graduate students have the support of the community and an unyielding belief 
that what they are fighting for is important and worth the battle.</p>
