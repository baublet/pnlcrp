	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1199 first began 
	in New York as a union of pharmacists. This union was unique in the fact 
	that it had members of all races and ethnicity, and this was a core idea in 
	their organization. Very few unions in the 30s supported integration in 
	actuality, though some claimed to. 1199 joined the American Federation of 
	Labor (AFL) as part of the Retail Clerks International in 1937. In 1943, it 
	briefly joined with another CIO retail union, Local 830, a merger that was 
	nearly fatal in a time when most of the members were fighting in WWII.<a title name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[1]</span></span></a> 
	However, 1199 “reorganized” in 1945, once again as an independent. They 
	continued to be successful until 1957, when they had exhausted the supply of 
	unorganized drugstores. When Elliott Godoff, one of the first people to ever 
	organize hospital workers, proposed that 1199 start organizing hospital 
	workers, it was met interest, if not enthusiasm. As the president of 1199, 
	Leon Davis, recalled later, they were looking for a challenge.<a title name="_ednref2" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[2]</span></span></a> 
	At the time, however, it was on a very small scale, for no one as yet 
	thought of hospitals as “industries”, who would be open to mass 
	organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

	were coming into effect at the time. Second, because of the type of work 
	that they do, healthcare givers are more vulnerable to exploitation. As

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most attempts to 
	organize hospital workers before 1199’s efforts centered on the white-collar 
	workers and virtually ignored the semi and unskilled laborers. When 1199 
	began the attempt to organize hospital workers, they focused on these ranks, 
	and had more success. Their first victory came at Montefiore Hospital, a 
	hospital liberal in who they hired, yet still opposed to labor unions. 1199 
	managed to organize the hospital in December of 1958<a title name="_ednref4" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[4]</span></span></a>, 
	though it took a strike before the hospital would recognize them. After 
	Montefiore, 1199 exuberantly turned their attention to some 40 other 
	hospitals in the area. They had a small, but motivated staff, and many of 
	the workers in these other hospitals were contacting the union of their own 
	initiative. Though the way certainly was not easy, by 1963 collective 
	bargaining was the law in voluntary hospitals, at least in New York. The 
	union had quadrupled its membership, and even more important, its membership 
	was very diversified, including African-Americans, Hispanics, and Puerto 
	Ricans. This led the union to become involved in civil rights movement as it 
	applied in the workplace as well as in other areas. </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things got 
	tougher in the 1970’s, with the government making changes in healthcare 
	reimbursement and other such areas. There was also a shift in how hospitals 
	are financed and operated, and the workers seemed to be the ones destined to 
	take the blows dealt out from small budgets and financial crisis. During 
	this time, 1199 decided that the way to fight it was to join with SEIU. 
	Unfortunately, during these talks in the late seventies, the president, Leon 
	Davis, had a severe stroke, and the talks of merger changed as the question 
	of succession threatened to tear the union apart. This internal struggle did 
	what no hospital administration could do, it split the union in two, 
	dividing it between the old New York base and the newer additions, and most 
	notably down race lines. </span></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">One key person who 
	violently opposed a merger with SEIU was Doris Turner. She had been promised 
	a nomination from Davis for presidency of the New York district chapter of 
	1199, but grew suspicious that he would go back on his word. She feared that 
	a merger would take the seat of power in 1199 away from New York, as well as 
	from the blacks. At this time Davis also named and got his successor to the 
	national presidency of 1199. In a unanimous vote: Henry Nicholas, a black, 
	who was nominated form the floor by Turner. While Turner maintained in 
	public that she loved Davis, tensions had been growing as early as 1978. 
	Nicholas was formally elected in December of 1981, but that didn’t stop 
	Turner’s fears that the merger was a racist and paternal ploy. She started 
	rallying black supporters, and though Davis had to go through on his promise 
	to nominate her for the district presidency the next year, due to a lack of 
	a different candidate, he started doing everything in his power to push the 
	merger through before April of 1982. This further tore the union down racial 
	lines. </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">Turner was elected in April 
	of 1982<a title name="_ednref5" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[5]</span></span></a>, 
	but the union continued to unravel. There was nothing the union members 
	could do, since the union depended on a strong leadership, and they were 
	helpless as the leaders started to veer off course. As tension continued to 
	mount, Turner went everywhere with an armed guard, certain that everyone was 
	out to get her because she was black and female. She also used her power as 
	president to purge her office. Many of the officers who supported the merger 
	with SEIU were forced out or resigned under duress. By April of 1984, less 
	than two years after taking office, ten district vice presidents and twelve 
	of fourteen guild organizers had left. Turner claimed that they had deserted 
	her administration. </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">There were shifts in how 
	the union was run. It started focusing the lesser skilled workers, mostly 
	black “homecare” workers and less on the mostly white RN’s. Racial pride was 
	encouraged, as were bible readings among members and the invocation of 
	prayer before contract talks. The New York district chapter of 1199 was 
	turning away from labor and into a group that celebrated Black Nationalism, 
	an ethnic clubhouse. The struggle between district and national came to a 
	peak in 1983, when Turner brought a campaign to challenge Nicholas’s 
	national presidency. She lost by one vote, and the battle raged on. </span>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">Finally, on July 1, 1984, 
	District 1199 in New York was allowed to detach itself from the national 
	union and regained its old position as Local 1199 of the RWDSU<a title name="_ednref6" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[6]</span></span></a>.

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">However, after a fruitless 
	strike that was lost in no small part because of Turner’s attitude and 
	unwillingness to compromise, combined with a loss of standing among both the 
	members and the public, Local 1199 began a slow but irreversible decline. 
	One of Turner’s supporters, sickened by what her own pride had done to the 
	union, stuck back by giving a sworn statement of ballot tampering in the 
	contested district officer election the previous spring. During this 
	scandal, coupled with many charges of misuse of funds, a group formed a 
	“Save our Union” campaign, and nominated Georgianna Johnson for the 
	presidency, mainly because she was a black female. She beat Turner in the 
	largest voter turnout in the history of the union, but by a year later 
	proved to be unequal to the task, some suggesting that she had gotten in 
	over her head. However, by this time she had come to view her position in 
	terms of race and ideology, and decided to fight back, eventually taking the 
	matter to court. Doris Turner returned to help Johnson, but in effect ruined 
	any chance she had, for as one worker put it, “Doris Turner negotiating my 
	next contract? No way.”<a title name="_ednref7" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[7]</span></span></a> 
	So, the core of people who still subscribed to the Leon Davis traditions had 
	hung on to power, but at a huge cost. Voting turnout among members in all 
	elections was down twenty-five percent, and the hospitals were almost 
	deadlocked. Even more disturbing, the differences seemed to come from a deep 
	racial split. From the outside, it seemed to be a victory, but a united 
	hospital union still seemed very far away. </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">The group that is now SEIU

	in Redmond became dissatisfied with the representation they were receiving 
	from WSNA (Washington State Nurses Association). WSNA also represents many 
	administrators and academic positions, as well as nurses. At this time, the 
	director of nursing was also on the bargaining unit, which seemed to be a 
	conflict of interest. The focus at the time was on the entry level education 
	for nurses, and not on issues that the nurses themselves deemed important.

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">Diane Sosne, a registered 
	nurse in the psychiatric mental health department, felt that it would be in 
	the nurses’ best interest if they started their own union. She contacted 
	1199 and they sent representative Glenn Goldstein, who proceeded to start a 
	building committee.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">To begin with, the nurses 
	had to decertify WSNA, and this could only be done at a certain time during 
	the year. In preparation, the committee made a model and started collecting 
	cards, which a person would sign if they were interested in starting/joining 
	a new union. During this process, it was a very one-on-one, personal 
	outreach program. Most of the recruitment was done by word of mouth. This 
	took about 8 months, and in May of 1983, they had an election to see if they 
	wanted to keep WSNA, start their own union, or be without representation. 
	The vote for a new union was passed and it started as Group Heath Registered 
	Nurses Union, but during the next year as they began creating by laws and 
	holding elections, the decision came to affiliate with 1199. Then in 1989, 
	they, as well as all 1199 chapters, joined with SEIU, which is now the 
	largest health care union in the nation, at roughly 1.5 million members.

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;Until a few years ago, 
	many nursing groups voted out WSNA and asked to be represented by SEIU 
	1199NW. Since that time, however, SEIU 1199NW has entered an agreement with 
	WSNA to not participate in “raiding”. Now, if an organization wishes to vote 
	out WSNA, they must be without representation for two years before asking to 
	be represented by SEIU 1199NW. The two organizations now try to work 
	together on common issues and concerns. It was never SEIU 1199NW’s goal to 
	take over already represented workers, they are focused and dedicated to 
	organizing the unorganized, though they never go into a situation without 
	first being invited. </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">SEIU 1199NW right now

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">One of the recent victories 
	of SEIU 1199NW is the banning of mandatory overtime for nurses. This has 
	become a big problem recently in light of the soon to be massive nursing 
	shortage. Before this law, a hospital could charge a nurse with abandoning 
	his or her patients if they left after their shift was over and there was no 
	one to take their place. Now, a nurse can choose whether or not to work 
	overtime with out fear of reprisals.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">One of the concerns that 
	SEIU 1199NW has now is about some 20,000 home care workers, who right now 
	are considered to be self-employed. This means they receive no benefits or 
	social security, even though the government pays most of their wages, 
	through Medicaid and Medicare. They are tying to get the government to 
	recognize the home care workers as employees of the state, which would 
	entitle them to all the benefits of a state employee.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">SEIU 1199 NW does, and will 
	continue, to improve the quality of the health care industry by organizing 
	workers and demanding better and safer working conditions for those workers 
	who help keep our country healthy.&nbsp; </span></p>
