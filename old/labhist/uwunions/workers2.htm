<p>The University of Washington employs more than 20,000 people in hundreds of
different capacities. The list of <a href="http://www.washington.edu/admin/hr/ocpsp/compensation/cmp.pln.pdfs/comp.plan.alpha.sort.PDF">job
titles</a> runs for 23 single spaced pages, and includes more than 4,000
faculty, 3,000 graduate student employees, 12,000 classified staff, and 4,000
professional staff. The <a href="http://www.washington.edu/admin/hr/">Human
Resources Department</a> keeps track of employment issues and its website is a
starting place for learning about UW's workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other pages of this web project describe the unions and professional
organizations that represent many of the campus workers. Here we want to profile
in some detail a few of the people who make UW work. We start with four reports
written by students in HSTAA 450 &quot;Class and Labor in American
History,&quot; hoping to add other materials soon.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://courses.washington.edu/hist450/union&amp;workersuw/tarhouni-workers.htm">Yasmine
Tarhouni</a> investigates the work experiences of food service workers in one of
the campus facilities, showing the new pattern of exploitation that has resulted
as management attempts to circumvent the state law limiting the use of temporary
workers. (This paper received the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies prize
for the best undergraduate research paper of 2002).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<a href="http://courses.washington.edu/hist450/union&amp;workersuw/mackin-workers.htm">Anni
Mackin</a> interviews three custodians, learning about the frustrations and
tensions that have become part of that job. She explores among other issues the
implementation of the “team” system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jonathan Gay describes the activities and attitudes of
office staff in one of the science departments, asking about their future plans
and their relations with their union.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Skilled Craft Workers:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are more than three hundred skilled craft workers at
UW who keep the buildings in good repair. Until recently they were represented
by the Seattle-King County Building Trades Council. But in June 2002, a majority
of the voting skilled workers chose to decertify the union. We have two reports
that were written just before the decertification election that profile these
workers and explore some of the issues that played out in that election. Tyson
Burchak describes the workers, their former union, and what was at the time a
forthcoming election. Jeremy Porter, himself an off-campus electrician who is
not a member of a union, offers what he calls an &quot;editorial treatise&quot;
on unions and &quot;pursuing the prevailing wage.&quot;</p>
