		Though often overlooked and under appreciated, the custodial staff of 
		the University of Washington is essential for the hour-to-hour success, 
		health, and overall comfort of the campus. The custodians perform a 
		large variety of tasks from window washing to vacuuming to trash and 
		recycling collection, and they face a certain amount of risk from 
		exposures to viruses from handling toxic chemicals. The University of 
		Washington employs 615 custodians<a title name="_ednref1" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a> 
		who work in over 150 buildings. All of these custodians are required to 
		be members of and pay dues to the union of Washington Federation of 
		State Employs (WFSE), Local 1488.&nbsp; Over the phone, I interviewed three 
		University of Washington custodians, Eric, Cindy, and Roger (not their 
		real names),<a title name="_ednref2" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> 
		who are members of the Local 1488 WFSE union. Eric, a long time 
		custodian, was once very active in the union but in the last few years 
		has become disillusioned with the union and currently only pays his 
		dues. Cindy, like Eric, has also been a long time custodian. Due to her 
		schedule, she no longer attends meetings, but she does pay her dues, 
		signs union petitions, and tries to keep up to date on union issues. 
		Roger, a custodian for only several years, presents himself as a very 
		enthusiastic and active union member. He seems to be inspired by the 
		leadership of the current president of the Local, John Frazier and wants 
		to build the Local union into a strong and powerful force by making it 
		more visible to members and University of Washington management. </p>

		The hierarchal structure of the custodial management seems to be as 
		follows: at the top is the upper management of the University, starting 
		with the president of the University; under them is some sort of middle 
		management; below them are the supervisors; and finally the supervisors 
		have worker leads who help to monitor the custodians. All three of the 
		members I interviewed seem to hold a high opinion of the upper 
		management, characterizing them as professional and respectful to the 
		custodians. The only problem they found with upper management was their 
		apparent unawareness of what middle management was doing. Middle 
		management, at best, seems to be viewed as distrustful and unqualified. 
		Roger went as far as to say they were “corrupted by power” and treated 
		the custodians as a class below them. He does not like his supervisor 
		and holds the same opinion of supervisors as he does of middle 
		management.&nbsp; Cindy likes her supervisor, who treats her nicely, but is 
		aware of other supervisors who are not so good. Eric doesn’t like his 
		current supervisors, but sympathizes with the supervisor’s difficult 
		position of mediating between different workers and management.&nbsp; All 
		three members believe that supervisors usually are not qualified for 
		their position, citing that few have ever actually worked as custodians 
		and, thus, do not have any working knowledge of the kind of labor 
		involved in custodial duties. They also do not believe that most 
		supervisors have the communication skills to manage such a diverse group 
		of workers. </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diversity of the custodial staff is due mainly to the 
		large number of immigrant workers. Eighty-five percent of the custodians 
		are considered minorities and many of those are Asian<a title name="_ednref3" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>.&nbsp; 
		Eric estimated that close to three-fourths of the custodians on campus 
		are immigrants. All three members feel that language barriers between 
		the workers themselves and between workers and management have caused 
		misunderstandings, distrust, conflicts, and have affected the efficiency 
		of their work and quality of the job they are able to do. Some of the 
		supervisors are also immigrants, which seems to further complicate the 
		issue. For instance, Cindy told of one Ethiopian supervisor who speaks 
		to the other Ethiopian custodians in their native tongue, causing 
		non-Ethiopian custodians to feel distrust toward her, because they do 
		not know what she is saying. Roger explained that they have had to start 
		using inferior cleaning chemicals in an attempt to decrease the chance 
		of an immigrant misreading a bottle and misusing a potentially dangerous 
		chemical. Roger also believes that management segregates immigrants, 
		allowing for less communication between workers about such things as the 
		union. The example he gave was that during a strike last year, a group 
		of Korean custodians did not participate because they had been 
		misinformed about the strike by their supervisor.&nbsp; This supervisor, who 
		spoke Korean, wasn't able to pass on any information about the impending 
		strike because they, as a group, had been isolated and weren't able to 
		get the information from other custodians outside their own immediate 
		group. He also thinks that management abuses the immigrants’ limited 
		knowledge of workers rights to intimidate them and keep them uninformed.
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary current concern of the custodians about their jobs 
		is the possible implementation of a new cleaning strategy called, 
		“Teamwork”. The strategy of “Teamwork” is to divide the custodians into 
		teams of two, three, or four and then give them a specific list of tasks 
		to perform throughout a building or even a group of buildings. This is 
		quite different from the current system of assigning a custodian an area 
		to clean alone. Middle management believes that “Teamwork” will be more 
		efficient and help to reduce strain on an already tight budget. Cindy 
		feels that with the new method, the whole team would be responsible for 
		getting the assigned tasks completed and because of that the custodians 
		who are the harder workers will end up picking up the slack for the 
		lazier and less productive custodians. She also anticipates 
		communication problems occurring between team members. Roger agrees with 
		her, citing that in Mary Gates Hall, where they have been experimenting 
		with “Teamwork” over the last few years, there has been a large increase 
		in conflicts amongst workers, sometimes even escalating into violence. 
		Eric, who works in Mary Gates Hall in the “Teamwork” system, does not 
		mind the system himself, because he enjoys his tasks, but does admit to 
		not liking it in the past when he was on bathroom cleaning duty. He also 
		says he has seen an increase in conflicts amongst his coworkers since 
		the implementation of “Teamwork”. All three members feel that middle 
		management should have either consulted them or the union before 
		implementing “Teamwork”. </p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the actual work of being custodians is concerned, 
		all three workers expressed that they do enjoy their jobs and get a 
		feeling of satisfaction from them. They appreciate the benefits that 
		they receive from the University – such as insurance, the chance to 
		attend the University of Washington for free, up to a month of vacation 
		time a year, and eight hours or more of sick leave a month. They also 
		recognize that compared to other custodial jobs that they are pretty 
		lucky to work at the University of Washington.</p>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The base of WFSE is its membership. The members belong to a 
		local and have a shop steward in their workplace. The steward handles 
		grievances and helps members with other union matters. The custodial 
		stewards are divided into areas, so that for every supervisor, there is 
		a steward. The local has meetings once a month for its members and the 
		local leadership to discuss issues and possibly vote on and implement 
		solutions. The local leadership, with member support, handles most of 
		the issues that come up. Issues that are too large for the local 
		leadership are passed on to the upper leadership via an area 
		representative. The upper leadership deals with the issues given to it 
		by the area representative, as well as organizes and participates in 
		state legislative lobbying. This model depends on active participation 
		by members, effective communication between and within all levels of the 
		union, and strong leadership. Both Eric and Roger believe that some of 
		these essential elements have been missing and thus have weakened the 
		union. Eric also believes that many members are apathetic and that this 
		apathy allows for poor union leadership. He thinks the leadership 
		concentrates more effort on legislative lobbying, rather than dealing 
		with workplace or worker raised issues. Roger, on the other hand, is 
		confident about the leadership, but also feels that because of the 
		apathy of the members, the leadership finds it difficult to complete 
		many of its objectives, especially those in the workplace. He believes 
		that this apathy is, in part, due to the lack of visibility and 
		communication by the union to its members. He also feels that another 
		communication pitfall in the union is between the area representative 
		and the upper leadership causing important issues, such as the 
		implementation of “Teamwork”, to never even having been communicated or 
		discussed between them. Whatever the case may be about the union 
		leadership, both Eric and Roger recognize the need for an active 
		membership to make the union strong. </p>

		<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 14pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 
		union’s participation and visibility in the custodial workplace, past 
		and currently, seems to be lacking. Neither Eric nor Cindy feels that 
		the union has caused any real improvements in their jobs. As far as the 
		“Teamwork” issue is concerned, Eric and Cindy both say that the Local 
		union has taken a stand against it, but has told the members that it is 
		out of their hands to stop it. When asked about filing grievances, Eric 
		said he once filed one, but that nothing came of it. He feels now that 
		if a problem or conflict arouse he would go to human resources before 
		going to his steward, believing that he would get better results from 
		human resources. Cindy has never had to file a grievance, but also feels 
		she would go to human resources before going to her steward. Her 
		hesitation about going to her steward is prompted by the fact that her 
		steward is also her worker lead, thus she feels that the steward would 
		be biased toward her supervisor and management. She does not like that 
		her steward is a lead and is perturbed by the fact that her steward was 
		not voted on – unlike past stewards. Roger agrees that the union should 
		be more visible in the workplace, but he feels that since he started 
		working, the union has become more accessible. He told me that when he 
		first started his job that he did not even know his steward. Roger also 
		expressed a strong, personal dedication to stopping “Teamwork”, saying 
		that he would be willing to go to the upper union leadership and upper 
		management himself to petition against it. Roger gave me the impression 
		that he files many grievances in order to keep his supervisor and 
		management in check. He admits that the grievances rarely ever come to a 
		satisfactory end and that this is because the union does not keep 
		grievances on file to be used as collaboration. Thus, the grievance 
		becomes the employee’s word against management’s word, with management 
		usually getting the benefit of the doubt. He said he would not go to 
		human resources about a problem, because he feels that they are too 
		connected with the management to be unbiased. </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The union seems to communicate to its custodial members in 
		four main ways: postings in the workplace, petitions, newsletters, and 
		meetings. The postings hang next to the timecard clock and inform 
		members on upcoming meetings, events, and important issues that the 
		union is dealing with. Only Roger mentioned the postings, suggesting 
		that they are not that visible or informative to members. Cindy spoke of 
		signing petitions that are sent around by the union, most particularly 
		the ones leading up to last years strike.&nbsp; It seems as if most of the 
		petitions are for legislative purposes that, with the high percentage of 
		minority and non-English speaking workers, might go unnoticed or ignored 
		for lack of the ability to read or understand them. WFSE sends out a 
		newsletter informing members on mostly legislative issues that the union 
		is handling. Both Eric and Cindy skim through the newsletters looking 
		for information that specifically applies to them, but they do not read 
		the all the articles and do not seem to fully understand or have 
		knowledge of what the union is doing in the state legislature. The 
		meetings are held once a month at seven in the evening at Harborview 
		Hospital. Cindy says she would go to the meetings if she could, but she 
		is unable to, because she has to stay home with her children in the 
		evening and get up early for work, which starts at five am. She said 
		that at one time the union held women-only meetings on campus during her 
		work hours and the supervisors would give the women an hour off to 
		attend them, which she did until they ended. Roger encourages members to 
		attend meetings, he explains to them that with more member support at 
		meetings, it is easier to present issues and implement solutions. He 
		said that for a while he tried holding meetings on the campus during the 
		custodians’ lunch break, but that the members complained that it was 
		taking away their lunch time.</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication with immigrants seems to pose a difficult 
		challenge to the union. Roger tells me that the union leadership, which 
		is also highly diverse, recognizes the extreme multiplicity of its 
		members and has been concentrating on how to fully include all members 
		in the union. One of the obstacles he feels in communicating with 
		immigrants is that many of them come from countries that do not have a 
		favorable view of unions and many of these immigrants do not fully 
		understand the protection given by unions. Thus, some immigrants are 
		wary of the union for fear of angering their supervisor or even losing 
		their job. The language barrier makes it even harder for immigrants to 
		understand the benefits of the union and participate in union 
		activities.</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local union, rather than giving its members insurance, 
		monetary benefits, or recognition awards, tries to reward and engage 
		them through events and small gifts. The members receive all their 
		health insurance and pension benefits through the University of 
		Washington, which does not seem to be a problem for the members I 
		interviewed. Eric and Cindy do, however, feel that the union could do 
		more to acknowledge the members’ importance to the union. Eric says that 
		all the union has given to him, as a member, has been “a pin and a hat”. 
		Cindy says that the union holds about one picnic in the summer and about 
		two banquets during the year, with one of these being a Christmas party. 
		She seems to be only mildly impressed by these events.</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One unusual event that was held last year was the one-day 
		strike. Roger considered the strike to have been more like a picnic 
		rather than a true strike. He feels that for a strike to be really 
		successful that it must be spontaneous and bring operations to a stand 
		still, but he does not feel that striking is a good negotiating tool to 
		use in general because it hurts members. However, he admits that last 
		year’s strike increased membership, solidarity among members, visibility 
		for the union, and helped in the Legislature. Cindy participated in the 
		strike last year as a way to make management aware of its limits and 
		also to show her support for the issue of pay raises. She said that 
		members did receive a slight pay raise following the strike and were 
		supposed to get a second pay raise, but the legislation for it did not 
		pass. Eric said he participated in the strike to support his coworkers, 
		but did not feel strongly about the issues. He did not say whether the 
		strike helped at all, but did say he lost a day’s pay and his perfect 
		attendance. </p>

		Cindy, and Roger, each differs in their opinions on what they would like 
		for the future of WFSE Local 1488. Eric believes that the union is on 
		its way out and thinks that the University of Washington should 
		subcontract a custodial service that might have better managerial 
		skills. Cindy wants the union to become more involved in the workplace, 
		especially with such issues as “Teamwork”, and to become more accessible 
		to members. She would also like to see union meetings at the workplace 
		again and possibly more union sponsored events. Furthermore, she thinks 
		that the union should give out awards to longtime members and for other 
		contributions by members. Roger feels that in order for the union to 
		become strong again in its ability to pass legislation, to effectively 
		bargain on their behalf, and to gain greater support in the workplace 
		that it must organize a larger, more active membership. He has 
		ambitiously set out to build this membership by planning to hold more 
		community events and safety meetings in the upcoming months to make the 
		union more visible to all its members and less frightening to immigrant 
		members. Right now, he says he goes around to individual members – 
		especially immigrants – talking to them about the union and how their 
		participation is important. He also has plans to try the lunch meetings 
		again, this time having them be catered. In addition, he wants to move 
		the postings board that is currently next to the timecard clock out into 
		a public place on campus, so that all the members plus university 
		students, faculty, and staff can find out about some of the WFSE issues. 
		To improve the grievance processes, he wants the union to start keeping 
		track of grievance and forming case studies on particular managers or 
		problems, thus making future grievances stronger and more likely to 
		produce results. Roger's final comment to me was, “The pack is back!” 
		reflecting his optimism and excitement about increasing member 
		participation and WFSE Local 1488’s strength.</p>
