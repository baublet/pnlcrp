			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service Employees International Union is one of the 
			many unions associated with the University of Washington. SEIU 
			1199NW is the bargaining representative for several chapters or job 
			classes at the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. As well, they 
			represent healthcare workers in hospitals, clinics, and other 
			settings across the state. Just who are these people however? Who 
			exactly do they represent and how? These questions and many more

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEIU1199NW is the local affiliate for the national SEIU 
			body. The national body was founded in Chicago in 1921 by a group of 
			immigrant janitors.<sup>1</sup> Since that time it has grown to be 
			the largest union in the AFL-CIO with over 1.5 million members in 
			the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Hundreds of locals have 
			been formed and are forming as the organizing continues at a fevered 
			pace. District 1199NW was set up in 1983 in the Puget Sound area and 
			was originally a core of nurses from Group Health Cooperative. It 
			was formed initially under the Hospital and Health Care Employees 
			Union<sup>2</sup> and later voted to join SEIU. It has since spread 
			throughout the state and is active in many different healthcare 
			settings. The state is divided in two with an office in Spokane for 
			the east side of the state and one in Renton for the west side. </p>

			SEIU has a very broad mission statement, which is: “To improve the 
			lives of working people and their families, and lead the way to a 
			more just and humane society.”<sub>­­</sub><sup>3</sup> Being a 
			national body, it is important that their vision be broad and far 
			reaching as they must represent hundreds of locals and districts 
			across the nation in the struggle to gain more for the working 
			class. </p>

			SEIU District 1199NW hones this vision to pertain more specifically 
			to its constituency here in the Northwest. It goes further in 
			specifying its goals and incentives. The district’s bylaws state 
			that its aim and purpose is to unite all employees within its 
			jurisdiction (Washington State) and to expand the control of its 
			members over all aspects of work. Furthermore it desires to protect 
			and advance the technical and professional status of its members, 
			promote recognition and respect for the vital role of the health 
			care employee, and to educate the membership in union principles and 
			democracy.<sup>4</sup> A key follow-up comes in the local’s guiding 
			principals which states “The policy of the District and its methods 
			of operation shall be such as to facilitate and stimulate the 
			broadest possible rank and file participation in the formulation and 
			execution of the program of the District…and to encourage 
			development of the most effective leadership.”<sup>5</sup></span></h3>

			Both the national and local levels of SEIU envision themselves in 
			the organizational model. That is, the focus of the union is to 
			place the bulk of its effort in the recruitment of new members 
			within current open shops (not everyone is a union member) as well 
			as to work with organizers in non-union shops. In taking this 
			approach, SEIU believes that by gaining more members nationwide, the 
			bargaining power of the unit will increase, and in so doing, the 
			abilities of each individual local will likewise increase. These 
			factors will allow for a greater empowerment of the locals in 
			working with management to gain favorable contracts. The locals will 
			have the backing of a powerful national union as well as strong 
			majorities within each local.</span></h3>

			The structure that comprises the SEIU is a very democratic one. 
			Members vote on who will represent them at the local and national 
			levels. Currently Andrew Stern is the President of the 
			International. He along with three executive vice presidents and a 
			secretary-treasurer have been voted in to guide the efforts of the 
			union on the national scene. All of these positions are full time 
			paid positions for the union.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the local level, the same basic structures exist. 
			1199NW has a President, Diane Sosne, an Executive Vice President, 
			Emily Van Bronkhorst, and Secretary-Treasurer, Chris Barton. All 
			three of these are full time paid positions. In addition to these, 
			there are two non-paid vice presidential positions. There is a vice 
			president for the private sector as well as one for the public 
			sector. Currently, Sara Cooney works as an RN at Group Health 
			representing the private sector and Marcy Johnson works as an RN in 
			the Department of Social and Health Services representing the public 
			sector. Diane Sosne along with the presidents of the other locals 
			represents 1199NW on the International’s Executive Board. This board 
			meets throughout the year to discuss the needs and the focus for 
			SEIU.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other positions within the local include union delegates 
			and executive board representatives. A delegate is a representative 
			for a particular work unit or department. The union with both local 
			and national resources trains these delegates to handle issues that 
			might come up in their work spaces as well as standing as an 
			advocate when some of these same issues are raised with the 
			management. Twice every year, these delegates meet in a delegate 
			assembly to discuss and plan the direction for the union as well as 
			approving a budget. These assemblies are not closed and are open to 
			the membership body.<sup>6</sup> </p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive board members are elected within each chapter of 
			the local. A chapter consists of a group of employees covered by a 
			distinct contract. If the size of the chapter exceeds 200 members, 
			then one additional representative is elected for each additional 
			200 members. Here in Washington, Group Heath Cooperative Registered 
			Nurses represent a chapter, and being spread across the state, each 
			region has a representative. These representatives then meet on a 
			monthly basis to discuss union issues and focus.<sup>7</sup></p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Union positions are for terms of two years and are voted 
			upon by the members. Any member in good standing for one year can 
			run for any position within the union. To be in good standing simply 
			means to have signed a union card and be current in your dues. The 
			member that desires to run for office must first gather a petition 
			with the signatures of ten percent of the good standing members in 
			the shop or area that they are to represent. Voting is then 
			conducted by mail as voter’s guides and ballots are sent out to the 
			membership. The returned ballots are then processed and counted by 
			the District Election Board and the vote is certified. This all 
			takes place in the spring with newly elected officers assuming their 
			roles in June.</p>

			The people that make up SEIU come from many different walks of life 
			and professions as well as varied racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
			They work in both the public and private sector. Based on numbers 
			that the union compiled in 1999, the racial percentages or cross 
			section within the union closely follow what is represented in 
			society as a whole. Caucasians are the majority at around 63 percent 
			with a mix of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Pacific Islanders, 
			and others comprising the other 37 percent.<sup> </sup>The average 
			annual income for members in 1999 was spread almost equally among 
			three categories: over $35,000, under $25,000, and between the two. 
			The age dominating is between 35 and 49, comprising 46 percent while 
			37 percent are 50 or older and a small number of people are between 
			18 and 35. The last figures compiled in 1999 were that the 
			organization is comprised of 58 percent women. It was also found 
			that a slight majority (56 percent) of the membership has only been 
			involved for ten years or less.<sup>8</sup></p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			Here in Washington, 1199NW is active in over 24 different medical 
			care systems. Job environments range from the largest hospitals and 
			Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) to small neighborhood 
			clinics. Within these organizations, members work as nurses, medical 
			technicians, food service workers, social care workers, and 
			physician assistants among others.</p>

			Dues are paid by the membership to assist in the success of the 
			local as well as the international. Generally they are based on a 
			small percentage of the base salary. Currently, the dues for 1199NW 
			are 1.5 percent of your gross monthly pay, with a cap set at $60 per 
			month. For newly hired employees there is a one-time $30 initiation 
			fee.<sup>9</sup></p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			The union’s dues go to pay for those things that the local decides 
			are most important and the dues will not increase without a vote 
			from the majority. At 1199NW, 50 percent of the dues paid are put to 
			direct action in negotiations and member support as well as better 
			or more improved communications and technology. The other 50 percent 
			has large chunks devoted to organizing new members (16 percent), a 
			strike and defense fund (10 percent), and support for the 
			international (17 percent). The remaining 7 percent is utilized in 
			coordinated campaigns, union coalitions, and legal expenses.<sup>10</sup></p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			There are many benefits that go hand in hand with membership in this 
			union. Many of the fringe benefits come down from the international 
			and are from the dues paid. The international has set up educational 
			scholarships and loan programs for the members and their families. 
			They offer several life and other health insurance plans at 
			discounted rates. For members purchasing homes or in need of other 
			funding there are home and personal loan programs sponsored by the 
			union. There are countless discount programs offered to union 
			members for computers, legal services, and even vacations.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			In addition to all these things the international has a vast array 
			of support materials for its membership. This includes a SEIU 
			website and the support of websites at the local level. The union 
			publishes countless brochures, pamphlets, and newsletters to keep 
			the locals informed and up to date with the union’s goals and 
			strategies.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			Finally, SEIU has a powerful lobby in Washington DC as well as at 
			the state government level. They are spending the time and money to 
			push for legislation that will help working families while fighting 
			anything that may give an advantage to the corporate managers and 
			hurt the worker. </p>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many relationships that 1199NW must maintain and 
			nurture. They must keep up with their constituents, the 
			international body, other SEIU locals, other unions, and finally 
			they must keep up with those industries in which the rank and file 
			toils.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Service Employees International Union local 1199NW has 
			a somewhat indirect relationship with the University of Washington. 
			The University has two main medical facilities for which it is 
			responsible in maintaining. The UW Medical Center (UWMC) located 
			just south of the Seattle campus is a 450-bed comprehensive care 
			facility and the Harborview Medical Center (HMC) is a 351-bed 
			facility closer to downtown in the First Hill neighborhood. HMC, 
			unlike the UWMC, is owned by King County and the UW is tasked with 
			managing its operations. 1199NW is the negotiating union only for 
			the personnel that work at HMC. There is an interesting dynamic that 
			is created from this arrangement that seems to work to the unions 
			favor. The union in this situation has several avenues to which 
			their voice can be heard. They can discuss issues with the Executive 
			Director of HMC, David Jaffee, or with the President of UW, Richard 
			McCormick. Being a county and state institution they can take issues 
			to those respective governmental bodies. Ultimately, HMC is managed 
			by the UW, but these other avenues can certainly act to put pressure 
			on the University to do what the union feels is right for its 
			workers. Though the relationship with the University may not always 
			be a great one, there has never been a full out strike of 1199NW 
			workers at HMC. There were members that respected some strike-like 
			actions taken by other unions at HMC recently but never an action 
			that came from within the local itself.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relationship that 1199NW has with other unions seems 
			to be a good one. In an interview at the local office with one of 
			the field organizers, Cathy Kaufman, she expressed that it is in the 
			best interest of all the separate locals to act together on issues, 
			especially when different unions support members in similar career 
			fields like healthcare.<sup>11</sup>Likewise, within SEIU there are 
			several different locals in Washington and it is important for them 
			to come together and draw clear lines of responsibilities and 
			focuses. This is happening currently between 1199NW and local 6. 
			There are many places where the memberships overlap and the 
			discussion now is in giving each local a clear focus. They are 
			working towards consolidating and moving members between the two 
			locals based on job types and locations. Local 6 will take up the 
			reigns for nursing home and home care employees and 1199NW will 
			focus on the larger hospitals.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cathy expressed the relationship that 1199NW has with the 
			international as being a good one. She spoke about the many benefits 
			(listed previously) that the international supplies to its members. 
			The international at the same time gives the locals a large amount 
			of autonomy to move in a direction that best suits the local. This 
			direction is generally guided by the international but not 
			micromanaged.&nbsp; </p>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The national body for SEIU along with the various locals 
			has been pushing many things through both local and national 
			governments. Currently there is a push to enforce better safety 
			standards when it comes to sharps (needles) in the medical 
			workspace. The desire is to require that needles have a safety cover 
			that will protect the worker after the needle has been used and 
			contaminated. This push is being spearheaded to a great deal by the 
			SEIU Nurse Alliance.<sup>12</sup> This is an internal group of 
			nurses keyed in on issues that most specifically affect the nursing 
			trade.</p>
			<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; MARGIN: 0in 1in 0pt 0.6in" class="MsoNormal">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The union as a whole is continuing its focus on organizing 
			the masses and uniting workers. At 1199NW, calls to the office and 
			requests for information about unionizing in various new work places 
			are outpacing the staff’s ability to handle them all. Recently at 
			HMC, the Health Care Specialists (Physician Assistants) voted a 
			majority (50 of 79) in favor of becoming a union shop. This means 
			essentially that they are all going to become dues paying members 
			and all future hires will be required to join as a condition of 
			employment. They can see a value in having an organization larger

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workloads at many of the hospitals and clinics in 
			which SEIU members work has been steadily increasing and managements 
			have been trying to cut staffing to keep up with rising costs and in 
			attempting to maintain profitability. SEIU is actively negotiating 
			with HMC for the RN chapter and is working to address issues of 
			short staffing and work place safety, not only for the nurses but 
			for the patients as well.</p>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, 1199NW is in the midst of its bi-annual 
			election cycle. The most advertised candidates are for the local 
			presidency, but as well, several Executive Board slots are up for a 
			vote. Each position of the local’s main presidency is currently 
			unopposed. This goes to show that the body is happy with the results 
			they have seen and are content with the vision of the current 
			leadership. </p>

			<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>In an expanding industry and with costs always on 
			the rise, the union is in place to ensure that the workers on the 
			bottom are given a just wage and benefits. SEIU has worked for more 
			than 75 years to this end. Through a democratic system and in making 
			an effort to empower the working class, SEIU has been successful. 
			Membership is growing and the fields that the union represents are 
			expanding. SEIU is taking hold of the workers desire for justice and 
			helping to make that justice a reality. </p>
