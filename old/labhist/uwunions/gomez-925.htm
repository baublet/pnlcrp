	<span style="font-family: Verdana">May 16<sup>th</sup>, 2002 marked the 
	kick-off of negotiations between the University of Washington and CSA/SEIU 
	Local 925 to bargain a new contract for thousands of classified staff 
	workers employed in the school.&nbsp; CSA—the Classified Staff Association—is the 
	university chapter of workers represented by Local 925 of the Service 
	Employees International Union.&nbsp; The promise of dignity and welfare for 
	workers spurs the optimism of the CSA Bargaining Committee on this otherwise 
	unassuming workday.&nbsp; And in the midst of an unseasonably cold and wet 
	spring, the participants are rewarded for their optimism with a surprise 
	visit from the sun, insuring the preferred conditions for a rally.&nbsp; Early 
	on, CSA and Local 925 leaders confer for a training session to reinforce the 
	union’s stance before management, reflecting the spirit of contract 
	negotiations.&nbsp; The session later resolves to the lighter task of organizing 
	a rally at midday to help generate momentum going into negotiations.&nbsp; Shop 
	stewards and work-site leaders from across the chapter don their own purple 
	and gold, portraying a willingness to cooperate with the university in spite 
	of the inherent strain of labor relations.&nbsp; Armed with kazoos, a healthy 
	dose of enthusiasm and a message, the group weighs in with a sizable crowd 
	in attendance at South Campus Center.</span></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana">How often do people who are normally 
	affiliated with the university (students included) consider the roles of 
	classified staff workers?&nbsp; If you have trouble picturing their identities, 
	then you can at least grasp the fundamental difficulty they face in their 
	ordinary work lives—that is, few are aware of their responsibilities, or 
	even their existence.&nbsp; The university’s classified staff toils behind the 
	scenes—in offices, labs, parking garages or other areas of seemingly 
	inconsequential utility—which facilitate the university’s larger commercial 
	concerns.&nbsp; In the early Seventies, a group of University of Washington 
	office workers responded to the indifference of their superiors by 
	establishing the Classified Staff Association.&nbsp; Later, under the 
	jurisdiction of SEIU’s District 925 branch (itself founded under the aegis 
	of primarily female office workers), CSA garnered the support of their 
	compatriots across the nation.&nbsp; The emboldened stance of a formerly marginal 
	segment of the workforce signified a return to Union values.&nbsp; The Union is 
	an organism composed of diverse individuals, joined in solidarity to 
	mobilize a singular ambition—to ensure the fulfillment of their lives in all 
	fairness.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Thus, unions and rallies go together.&nbsp; On 
	May 16th, CSA members joined with the public to celebrate this message.&nbsp; 
	Unattached to the emotional swell (as a student and a worker with absolutely
	<i>zero </i>experience with grass-roots collective action), I had just spied 
	a case of unionism in action.&nbsp; CSA had previously bargained for stewards’ 
	leave to attend meetings similar to the training session earlier that day, 
	enabling a measure of the union’s internal organizing mechanism.&nbsp; Shop 
	stewards occupy the front lines of the organization, providing rank-and-file 
	workers with immediate access to the information that best serves their 
	needs.&nbsp; Outside of the organization, CSA actively communicates with the 
	public in order to maximize solidarity across an ever-diversified 
	constituency.&nbsp; The day’s proceedings successfully merged the twinned 
	purposes of internal and political organizing: to promote communication and 
	education among workers, and to instill a pro-worker consensus across the 
	public.</span></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As union members and supporters 
	took their message to the street, I happened upon an acquaintance (whom I 
	barely know) who followed the event with passing interest.&nbsp; Striking up a 
	conversation, I learned that she is an office worker in an adjacent 
	building, a full-member of CSA with all her faith in the appropriation of 
	her dues.&nbsp; What does she know of the day’s events?&nbsp; Does she know the issues 
	that her bargaining committee is pursuing, I asked?&nbsp; She received notice 
	from the union urging vocal support but her presence at the rally happened 
	to coincide with her work hours.&nbsp; Quite incidentally, she followed the 
	marchers as she returned to work from lunch.&nbsp; Were it not for her work 
	hours, would she have joined with the kazoo marching band?&nbsp; With a hint of 
	regret, she suggested that her personal obligations limited the extent of 
	her involvement with the union.&nbsp; There is no getting around the first order 
	of business for a lot of rank-and-file members, and for that she rightfully 
	expressed little regret.&nbsp; After all, she contributes full dues not out of 
	coercion (she joined the union before workers voted to implement agency shop 
	measures) but for her own conviction surrounding one’s inalienable right to 
	dignity and respect; that in some measure she helps to secure the prestige 
	of an honest and hard-fought position in society.&nbsp; There simply is not 
	enough time for people to take up yet another occupation, one that promises 
	no immediate gratification--to personally preserve and/or advance their 
	social statuses.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Shaking workers out of their indifference 
	and ambivalence towards the actions of the union demands an on-going 
	commitment to kinetic pro-activism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some folks may wonder what all the 
	hype means to the average worker.&nbsp; As long as (s)he pays dues, with someone 
	else in charge of handling the resources, why must the worker bother 
	otherwise?&nbsp; Ideally, worker participation entails much more than forking 
	over some money.&nbsp; When CSA members who comprised a majority in their 
	respective worksites voted for an agency shop in 1993, the dissenting 
	minority (those who were not a part of the union) came under the 
	jurisdiction of the union.&nbsp; In an agency shop, an incoming employee agrees 
	to pay, 1) a full membership fee (CSA requires 1.4% of gross income, up to 
	$45/month) that insures the rights to vote and to run for office or, 2) an 
	agency (or “fair-share”) fee, which in this case runs at 90% of the full 
	membership rate but excludes full membership rights.&nbsp; Thus, solidarity 
	suffers from the impression that the leadership ungraciously extracts dues 
	in order to pursue indeterminate goals.&nbsp; Under collective bargaining all 
	workers, in spite of their respective views, receive benefits that the union 
	fights for.&nbsp; How does this justify what is in essence a coercive measure?&nbsp; 
	Some might feel that collective bargaining is not worth the trouble, that 
	the decision to pay dues should reside with the individual even if 
	non-membership means exclusion from the contract.&nbsp; Workers often fail to 
	recognize the full extent of solidarity.&nbsp; One cannot really turn off his/her 
	effect upon other workers.&nbsp; The union <i>must</i> bargain on behalf of all<i>
	</i>workers.&nbsp; The relative statuses of each worker are crucial to the 
	legitimacy of any claim for equality.&nbsp; In the course of bargaining, 
	management may insist, “Group X doesn’t get as much. Why should you?”&nbsp; If 
	even one worker successfully negotiates for greater concessions, it is 
	because everyone shall receive the same deal—including dissenters.&nbsp; One’s 
	mere presence in the workplace <i>demands</i> solidarity.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from a handful of CSA 
	leaders, I have spoken with few union members—mostly university office 
	workers who stop into the store I work in.&nbsp; Outside of courteous inquiries 
	about their workday (the weekend couldn’t arrive sooner for most), I never 
	bothered to ask about the nature of their jobs before I realized the gravity 
	of their union engagements.&nbsp; Inspired by the leaders I had already spoken 
	with, I began to ask some of them what they thought of the union.&nbsp; All admit 
	to full membership.&nbsp; When I ask about their willingness to participate in 
	union business, responses vary from a curt “I only know that they take out 
	some of my wages” to grand appeals for democracy and labor activism.&nbsp; Though 
	the union suffers its share of detractors, the people I talked with are 
	supportive.&nbsp; Those with little knowledge of the union seem petrified to 
	admit ignorance, fearing the impression that their contributions to the 
	struggle are inadequate.&nbsp; Others incline to chat away about an exclusive 
	other-world that only they know about, particular to the university’s 
	treatment of an “invisible” work force.&nbsp; None of them have extensive 
	experience with contract negotiations, periodic chapter meetings, and few 
	have read the articles of the current contract.&nbsp; By no means do they 
	represent an accurate sample (I’m talking about no more than five people), 
	but their experiences illustrate the challenges facing CSA’s leadership, 
	namely to involve as many people as possible in a bit of world-shaking.&nbsp; 
	Rene DeVine, the current President of CSA, describes the situation: “Many 
	stewards, many work-site leaders will tell you, ‘The people I contact just 
	don’t care.’&nbsp; The on-going challenge of the organizing model is to help 
	people see why they should care.”</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">CSA—along with joint Local 925 chapters, 
	as well as numerous sub-divisions of the parent Service Employees 
	International Union—expressly strive to uphold the organizing model of 
	unionism.&nbsp; The organizing model is not a hard and fast hierarchy of 
	decision-making that functions solely as a representative democracy.&nbsp; 
	Rather, it is an ideology one step removed from direct democracy, demanding 
	not only the Individual’s right to be heard but that each individual must 
	have the stomach to speak up.&nbsp; Without maximum participation, the union will 
	likely live on thanks to a talented minority, but at a limited capacity.&nbsp; 
	One might suspect that, with their livelihoods on the line, workers will 
	jump at the chance of self-government.&nbsp; Constant antagonism between 
	management and workers, however, adds up to the massive task of collective 
	bargaining, a rational tug-of-war over resources that end up eating too much 
	time and energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus even a grass roots democratic union begs the 
	specialization of labor relations.&nbsp; Workers free themselves of this task in 
	lieu of their responsibility to vote for the experts that fight for their 
	collective interests.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Too much concentration of 
	decision-making, however, belies the original concept of democratic 
	unionism.&nbsp; With idle time comes complacency for some members; and without 
	their vigilance, the union may cease to act as a cohesive unit.&nbsp; The 
	division of labor—within the industry and within the union—increases 
	rank-and-file anonymity.&nbsp; Thus, the service (or business) model of unionism, 
	in contrast to the organizing model, encourages a top-heavy orientation of 
	control that, in the face of rank-and-file complacency, efficiently conducts 
	union business.&nbsp; Management poses a tough enough foe for union leaders, 
	never mind the burden of soothing the cognitive strain upon their 
	constituents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dornie MacKenzie, former President of CSA who currently 
	works as an Organizing Representative with the Local 925 body, distinguishes 
	the two models:&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Verdana">A lot of organizing 
	reps [who join Local 925] have a difficult time transitioning to the 
	organizing model, because they’re used to going in there and being the 
	person in charge.&nbsp; It’s hard for them to teach the members to [become 
	involved].&nbsp; Under the service model, the union [leadership] becomes a third 
	party.&nbsp; Members forget that <i>they </i>are the union.&nbsp; If they’re not in 
	charge of the situation—if they are not empowering their co-worker—then it 
	is no longer a union, in my opinion.</span></p>

	the contact and support of her long time associates.&nbsp; The ease of her 
	dismissal over a simple inquiry, and the relative powerlessness of her 
	friends to stop it, spurred their search for alternative actions.&nbsp; At a 
	meeting to discuss the situation, a friend of the departed colleague who was 
	involved with CSA notified Rene about CSA’s intent to organize more 
	technical workers. Assuming the organizing role, Rene initiated 
	communications with the union.&nbsp; The coordination of both parties enabled 
	Rene and her co-workers voted unanimously to join CSA.&nbsp; The presence of 
	union solidarity immediately impacted their status before management (“We 
	did eventually succeed in getting rid of that bad boss,” exclaims Rene).&nbsp; 
	After four months of displacement, the aforementioned worker returned to her 
	original position after filing her own grievance for the discipline she 
	received.&nbsp; Rene describes how the union affected her job: “Becoming part of

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Last year, after serving a term as CSA 
	Vice President, Rene was elected President.&nbsp; Aside from her duties 
	overseeing the expenditure of monies (presiding over the Executive Council), 
	the organizational direction of the union (as a member of the Organizing 
	Council, to convey the strategies aimed at mobilizing member involvement); 
	monitoring the feasibility of contract enforcement on a case-per-case basis 
	(as a member of the Grievance Committee); as spokesperson at each membership 
	business meeting; and as an elected member of the current bargaining team, 
	Rene continues to<i> </i>keep in touch with as many members as her schedule 
	will allow.&nbsp; Her position as an officer with CSA is voluntary; she is still 
	a full-time worker at the Medical Center.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Needless to say, Dornie MacKenzie knows 
	the feeling.&nbsp; Dornie occupied the CSA Presidency in the previous term before 
	accepting her position as an Organizing Representative with the Local a 
	year-and-a-half ago.&nbsp; She joined the University of Washington, School of 
	Medicine in 1994, working as a program director for the Physicians Assistant 
	Training Program.&nbsp; At the time, CSA had already secured support in that 
	area, to which Dornie immediately complied.&nbsp; She grew up in a family that 
	harbored impressive union loyalty, and her newly acquired job suited her 
	inclinations very well.&nbsp; Soon after, she took up the added responsibility of 
	representing her co-workers before management.&nbsp; A degree of naiveté 
	accompanies the supreme optimism that characterizes Dornie’s entrance into 
	union life; like Rene, she wanted to actively participate in labor relations 
	but jumped in with both fingers crossed:&nbsp; “As far as being a steward, I had 
	no idea.&nbsp; Your mentor is the [Organizing] Rep, who is with you through 
	everything—on the phone or at meetings, to teach you.” &nbsp;Having navigated her 
	initial trials as a steward, Dornie has emerged into the mentor’s role. As a 
	member of the current Bargaining Committee, her presence at the first 
	contract meeting on May 16<sup>th</sup> proved to stabilize the emotions of 
	her less experienced compatriots.&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Dornie and Rene have directly engaged 
	their fellow members without relying too heavily on the structural allotment 
	of power.&nbsp; That is, the steward emphasizes the power of one’s <i>own</i> 
	participation in the grievance process. &nbsp;If a worker believes that 
	management overreaches the contractual provisions of his/her job, the worker 
	may grieve the situation.&nbsp; “What we want to happen is to resolve grievances 
	at the lowest level possible,” Rene explains.&nbsp; “So when I meet with 
	somebody, I will ask them, ‘Have you spoken with your manager, do they know 
	about this situation?’”&nbsp;&nbsp; If management insists on stonewalling, the steward 
	will step in with the advice from higher up.&nbsp; The Organizing 
	Representative—a full-time union staffer—maintains communication with the 
	steward throughout the grievance procedure.&nbsp; But the expressed 
	responsibility of dealing with an uncooperative boss ultimately lies with 
	the individual, with immediate guidance provided by the steward.&nbsp; The 
	steward enforces the bargaining agreement with administration, assuming the 
	role of a hyperactive, encyclopedic referee.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A significant number of 
	grievances derive from what may be considered unfair disciplinary measures 
	enacted by management.&nbsp; Like grievances, disciplines take on a formal 
	process.&nbsp; Both sides assemble a short committee to discuss the conflict, 
	systematically convening at appropriate intervals.&nbsp; Should the average 
	rank-and-file member ever have an excuse to communicate with his/her 
	superiors, now is the time that the union has fought for to bring the sides 
	together.&nbsp; Stewards are involved in more disciplinary actions than 
	grievances, but their responsibility to maintain a fair shake for the worker 
	remains the same.&nbsp; At this immediate level, the channels for educating the 
	worker actively flow between the Organizing Rep (given the position’s 
	full-time emphasis, the Rep maintains the highest level of experience in the 
	matter), the steward and the worker who, as the locus of antagonism, endures 
	the roughest transition to empowerment.&nbsp; No rules apply to the preservation 
	of decorum in the proceedings outside of the agreement to meet; thus, the 
	worker may retain the services of any that (s)he wishes to attend if it 
	enables equal footing with management.&nbsp; “When you see a member go into a 
	meeting,” explains Dornie, “stand up to the boss, and come out of there 
	feeling stronger, more empowered—that is worth all the hardship.”</span></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana">As a Rep, Dornie spends endless hours 
	talking with anyone who will listen.&nbsp; The Rep professes to demystify complex 
	labor concerns that might seem too far removed from the average worker.&nbsp; 
	While Local 925 harbors public-sector workers throughout Western Washington, 
	Dornie’s turf includes the University of Washington campus, the Medical 
	Center, and part of the Health Sciences Building.&nbsp; Her main job boils down 
	to leadership development—finding and appointing stewards and other 
	work-site leaders in underrepresented areas.&nbsp; This entails another obstacle 
	to the union’s internal organizing approach.&nbsp; CSA maintains in the contract 
	that the university shall pay for the steward’s time away from work in order 
	to attend grievance and disciplinary meetings.&nbsp; In turn, the university 
	consistently bargains for a ceiling upon the number of stewards the union 
	may appoint, thus limiting their commitment to service other workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	university ostensibly enacts these measures to minimize its own financial 
	burden.&nbsp; In the end, the union must contend with a number of “holes,” where 
	workers have little or no contact with knowledgeable leaders.&nbsp; In the 
	absence of stewards, Dornie aims at nurturing the leadership capacities of 
	every worker, particularly in isolated areas.&nbsp; Upon finding a “hole” where 
	she does not know anybody in the department, Dornie typically finds her work 
	cut out for her: “It’s not always comfortable going in there, but it can be 
	extremely rewarding.”&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">Ideally, the membership will include a 
	work-site leader for every ten members, though many areas lack a sufficient 
	number of these information specialists.&nbsp; Periodic union business meetings 
	draw CCN’ers to engage workers who do not have the time to attend such 
	meetings.&nbsp; “We acknowledge that we’re not going to have a meeting where all 
	five thousand members show up,” Rene explains.&nbsp; “But can we have a meeting 
	where a hundred leaders show up?&nbsp; Yes, certainly.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The CSA Communications 
	Network (CCN) formally embodies the union’s internal outreach mechanism.&nbsp; 
	Work-site leaders who take up her message form a network of CCN’ers across 
	the chapter.&nbsp; Though appointees carry out the title’s formal duties, many 
	fulfill the role simply for their enthusiasm to learn and to inform fellow 
	workers.&nbsp; Leadership development, along with an emphasis upon progressive 
	communications technologies (including video conferencing and a new 
	web-site), continues to evolve at a rate that will benefit a growing 
	membership.</span></p>
