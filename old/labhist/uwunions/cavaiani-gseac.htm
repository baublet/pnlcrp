	At universities across the nation, the call to unionize graduate student 
	teaching assistants has become quite common.&nbsp; For the most part, the recent 
	boom in TA unionization has come out of the visible changes that have taken 
	place at the university.&nbsp; The number of undergraduates enrolling at 
	universities around the nation has grown substantially.&nbsp; This growth has 
	caused universities to expand their graduate programs to keep up with the 
	rise of enrolling graduates and undergraduates. In turn, the university has 
	begun to rely heavily on this pool of qualified students for the completion 
	of a large part of undergraduate instruction.&nbsp; Since 1975, the number of 
	graduate students who work as teaching assistants has risen 35 percent, and 
	the number of actual hours undergraduates spend with teaching assistants 
	continues to rise (AAUP, 1995).&nbsp; “It is estimated that nationally between 50 
	and 70 percent of all teaching hours are done by graduate students and other 
	non-tenured faculty”.<a title name="_ednref1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[1]</span></span></a></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	At first TAs truly were only assisting professors, but TAs duties now 
	reflect that of faculty, while their compensation for their work continues 
	to lag.&nbsp; Paying student teaching assistants between $6,000 and $20,000 a 
	year, universities have found it beneficial to draw from this cheap labor 
	pool rather than hire new faculty.&nbsp; The Kansas Public Employee Relations 
	Board found that graduate teaching assistants at the University of Kansas 
	had taught 25 upper-level undergraduate courses in 1993.&nbsp; The cost to pay 
	the TAs was $51,297; had faculty been hired for those positions, the cost 
	that year would have soared to $209,413. At Yale, the use of graduate 
	students is estimated to have produced a savings of over $5 million per year 
	and allowed administrators to eliminate nearly two hundred junior faculty 
	positions.<a title name="_ednref2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	These positions given to graduate teaching assistants typically offer low 
	wages, no benefits, job security, or academic freedom. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolution of TA duties has put graduate teaching assistants in 
	a peculiar position; they do much of the same work as tenured faculty, yet 
	they are most often paid less than a livable wage. According to student 
	organizers at Maryland, the university states that graduate students need 
	$12,375 to live adequately for nine months, but some of their TAs receive 
	less than $10,000 per school year after taxes.<a title name="_ednref3" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	TAs must grade a substantial amount of undergraduate work, teach many 
	undergraduate courses alone, and face increasing work loads at minimal pay, 
	while being excluded from departmental meetings, cope with little job 
	security while working on a semester-to-semester basis and work with little 
	to no administrative support.&nbsp; TAs work and live in these kinds of 
	conditions while facing disproportionate wages, declining health benefits, 
	and the absence of grieving procedures – not to mention rising tuition and 
	enrollment fees.&nbsp; Without a union, teaching assistants have no say in these 
	issues that affect them directly. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the majority of their history, TAs have worked and lived in 
	conditions that have been less than favorable.&nbsp; And, with growing dependence 
	on them by the university, their situation will only intensify.&nbsp; Through the 
	organizing of unions, graduate students employed by the university have 
	begun taking – by force if necessary – the situation into their own hands.&nbsp; 
	Understanding that the university has little regard for the fate of its own 
	TAs, many unions began their organizing drive in response to administrative 
	decisions.&nbsp; Two of the very first graduate teaching assistant unions came 
	out of the necessity for a representative voice.&nbsp; The Teaching Assistants’ 
	Association (TAA) of the University of Wisconsin-Madison was born out of a 
	legislative proposal to deny out-of-state tuition remission to graduate 
	assistants.&nbsp; The Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the official 
	bargaining agent for TAs of the University of Michigan, began its organizing 
	drive following a 24 percent increase in tuition.&nbsp; Officially certified in 
	1969 and 1974 respectively, these unions fought against the growth of the 
	same issues that plague university campuses today.&nbsp; Without a collective 
	voice, the TAA and the GEO would have been subject to the demands of the 
	university, but in recognizing their own strength in numbers, they were able 
	to fight for bargaining rights on issues that concern them as students and 
	as employees.&nbsp; Without the Teaching Assistants’ Association, UW graduate 
	student employees would not enjoy the benefits the union helped provide.&nbsp; 
	Not only was the bill to deny out-of-state tuition remission to graduate 
	assistants yanked, but the TAs, for the first time, “won the security of 3-4 
	year support guarantees, an effective grievance procedure, workload 
	limitations, fair discipline and discharge procedures, class-size 
	limitations, a democratic evaluation process and health insurance.”<a title name="_ednref4" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Graduate students at the University of Michigan find themselves among the 
	nations most adequately compensated TAs with an insurance package that 
	matches the University's faculty, a feat only accomplished through GEO 
	bargaining efforts.&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle for collective representation has continuously been an 
	uphill one.&nbsp; In the past, TAs have tried alternative forms of 
	representation, but with less success than unions have provided them.&nbsp; For 
	instance, the Graduate Students’ Advisory Council (GSAC) at the University 
	of Illinois is a program in which graduate students give their 
	recommendations about issues that concern them.&nbsp; These recommendations hold 
	no legal weight and GSAC's input is often only sought after the 
	administration has made their decisions.&nbsp; Because GSAC is not a union and 
	its members function only as students, the University of Illinois is under 
	no obligation to negotiate with them and the university has the right to 
	prohibit the group from discussing the major issues of employment.&nbsp; The 
	Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) at Yale serves as a communication link 
	between graduate students and the administration. The committee, made up of 
	faculty and graduate students, exchanges ideas and fosters discussions 
	concerning major policy changes.&nbsp; They are permitted to discuss issues 
	concerning graduate students and are expected to reach agreements with the 
	graduate school Dean over such issues. Under GSA, the graduate students 
	would not have a voice in the final decisions of the administration and 
	would remain unsure of what the end of each contract would bring. In this 
	form of representation, graduate students are still bound by university 
	rules and there is no negotiation about these policies.</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reluctance of the university to recognize TA unions stems from 
	their desire to continue the current arrangement that has been so beneficial 
	to them.&nbsp; The administration understands that they are responsible for the 
	situations within the university that has created this cheap labor pool that 
	is relied so heavily on.&nbsp; To try and keep their hands clean, the 
	administration has consistently tried to mask the true picture of the 
	graduate student teaching assistant by explaining it all away.&nbsp; The long 
	heard cry from administration is that TAs are not employees, but students.&nbsp; 
	These students, they argue, are simply apprentices learning a trade.&nbsp; They 
	explain that TAs are teaching in furtherance of their degree and would not 
	be teaching undergraduates if they were not primarily students of the 
	university, turning their duties as a teacher into a part of graduate 
	learning experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Teaching undergraduates is not a degree requirement, 
	nor a part of graduate curriculum. Often, TAs have finished all of their 
	coursework and are only working on their dissertations while they teach.&nbsp; 
	Teaching assistants can be hired or fired by the university, and are given 
	some sort of faculty handbook and training.&nbsp; They use supplies furnished by 
	the school, and are often required to commit to up to 20 hours per week 
	where they are expected to hold office hours for undergraduate 
	consultation.&nbsp; If there were a lack of TAs, then classes would have to be 
	altered or canceled.&nbsp; TAs, then, are more than apprentices who are learning 
	– their jobs have grown into faculty.&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	The administration claims that the stipends TAs receive for their work is 
	part of the financial aid package that they are given to sustain them as 
	students of the university.&nbsp; Yet, their compensation often comes through the 
	universities payroll and TAs must fill out W-4 forms so that taxes may be 
	withheld from their checks.&nbsp; In reality, TAs perform work for which they are 
	paid and this is the typical model of an employee.&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	The administration also states that TA unionization will only hurt 
	undergraduate education; arguing that when negotiations between 
	administration and the union falter, undergraduates bear the consequences.&nbsp; 
	Most often in this argument, the Yale grade strike is pointed out.&nbsp; In early 
	December 1995, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO) 
	called for a grade strike when the administration refused to engage in 
	collective bargaining with its graduate student employees.&nbsp; Participating 
	TAs withheld the grades of their undergraduate students. The University 
	called GESO's tactic an attempt by one group to hold another hostage for its 
	own gains.&nbsp; GESO contends that the approach was meant to show the 
	administration how important TAs are to the structure of the university and 
	because they are so dependent upon them they cannot be ignored.&nbsp; Referring 
	to repeated threats aimed at the striking TAs, GESO points out the way that 
	TAs are treated when they lack a voice in their situation.&nbsp; Because TAs have 
	become such a fundamental part of undergraduate education, they state that 
	without an institutional voice the quality of undergrad education is 
	threatened when working conditions impair their ability to perform well.&nbsp; 
	TAs include among their demands – requests for adequate training, better 
	facilities, and smaller class sizes.&nbsp; TAs insist a union will also benefit 
	undergraduate education by fighting for adequate pay that will leave TAs 
	more time to concentrate on classes instead of on their secondary incomes.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	University administrators have argued that the creation of teaching 
	assistant unions will undermine faculty/student relationships. They believe 
	that if TAs became a collective voice, it would hamper the relationships 
	that professors have with their students. Due to the openness of this 
	relationship, the administration maintains that professors will begin to 
	feel that they have less of a mentor relationship with their students and 
	more of a business arrangement where freedom in the discussion of ideas 
	becomes lost and all avenues of communication between TA and faculty would 
	become restricted.&nbsp; It is worried that once teaching assistants are cast in 
	the role of “employee”, faculty would be labeled “supervisors” and it would 
	be understood that faculty would be acting on the universities behalf.&nbsp; In 
	this relationship, professors might be reluctant to discuss wide-ranging 
	topics with students.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unionization would also establish formal procedures 
	for students to bring grievances against faculty members who may feel that 
	their future dealings with the student may be looked at as a form of 
	retaliation. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	TAs feel there is no such threat to faculty/student relationships.&nbsp; Union 
	members adamantly insist that unionization concerns their relationship as 
	teachers with the institution they work for, not as students with their 
	advisors.&nbsp; The administration makes the decisions that affect TAs working 
	conditions, not the faculty.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 1999 survey conducted by Tufts University, 
	confirms this understanding.&nbsp; Ninety percent of the faculty at five 
	universities said that TA unions have not harmed their mentoring 
	relationships with graduate students.<a title name="_ednref5" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Similarly, the Chair of the History Department at the University of 
	Wisconsin-Madison – the university with the longest running teaching 
	assistant union – remarked that “the sense of professionalism encouraged by 
	union organization has facilitated a positive working relationship and 
	minimized misunderstanding” among students, faculty and administration.<a title name="_ednref6" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[6]</span></span></a>

	At a rally on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduate 
	students held a replica of the building to suggest that the work of teaching 
	assistants “carry” the University.&nbsp; The dependence on TAs has moved beyond 
	the apprentice relationship it once was. There is no question as to the 
	importance of the work performed by graduate students or to the dependence 
	on that work by the university. With the shrinking percentages of full-time 
	faculty, the university is shifting many teaching responsibilities to 
	graduate students. The evolution of the teaching assistant’s job now bears a 
	resemblance to that of faculty.&nbsp; The responsibility of undergraduate 
	education is now shared with graduate teachers who lack the power to 
	influence their situations.&nbsp; The fight to be recognized as an “employee” is 
	crucial because the very word holds the power that TAs seek.&nbsp; As an employee 
	of the university, TAs have legal right to form a union that can negotiate 
	the terms of their employment.&nbsp; As an employer, the university is legally 
	obligated to recognize this union and bargain in good faith.&nbsp; To accept 
	teaching assistants as employees of the university, administration must give 
	up the advantages that they have so long enjoyed by exploiting this group.&nbsp; 
	TAs jobs have evolved over time and their fight to balance the power of the 
	administration rests in the belief that the universities can no longer deny 
	the role that these student employees perform at their institution.&nbsp; </p>
