	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">In April the 
	Washington State Legislature granted unionization and collective bargaining 
	rights to state faculty. Its success has been a result of crisis and 
	opportunity both coming together in the past year. Threats to faculty status 
	and funding as a result of a deepening budget crisis and aggressive labor 
	action from the Graduate Student Employee Action Coalition (GSEAC) were the 
	fuel that drove the campaign for these rights to Olympia. But the University 
	of Washington chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) 
	has been campaigning for these rights here since the early 1970s, and the 
	national organization has <i>always</i> campaigned along similar lines.
	<span class="GramE">So why now?</span> What has taken academia so long to 
	recognize the rights of its faculty? The issues at stake, as I will show, 
	are not simply the ones at the forefront today. These struggles concern the 
	very nature of higher education itself. This essay attempts not only to 
	account the history of the AAUP, but to study the underlying fabric it is 
	woven into.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AAUP has 
	always been an idealistic organization, and not simply because of the nature 
	of its membership. It has rather been a matter of sheer necessity. Its 
	primary commitments have always been academic freedom and the institution of 
	tenure to assure it, and, more or less it has remained solidly dedicated to 
	these principles. Compromising on principles is, as any union knows, a 
	mistake. For the AAUP, the cost of mistakes may mean more than the loss of a 
	few benefits. Created in 1915 in response to actions against university 
	faculty for their views, political and otherwise, it was already setting 
	itself against the educational trend of the day. Between 1889 and 1906 
	William Torrey Harris had all but finished the systemization of American 
	education through his tireless promotion of a model informed by the 
	perceived brilliance and strength of the Prussian education philosophy and 
	Harris’ own Hegelianism. He transferred his reputation as America’s leading 
	German philosophical scholar and his extensive political connections into 
	the “scientific” construction of school, and what we now regard as a proper 
	and modern model spread from state to state, beginning with Missouri, where 
	he began his political career as Superintendent of Schools. In many ways, 
	Harris is a hero, a pioneer who believed wholly in education as the key to a 
	working society. He established the first kindergarten system in St. Louis 
	in 1873, transplanting the structure (and name) straight from Germany. But 
	there is a wholly darker side to this philosophy, leading directly from the 
	teachings of Hegel himself, whose philosophies dominated continental 
	thinking well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Hegel believed in the state 
	as the absolute expression of reason, as the <i>end product of history 
	itself</i>. Everything must be therefore subordinate to the state, 
	especially education. Students were to be state <i>property</i>, their 
	education centrally dictated for its benefit. In his magnum opus, <i>The 
	Philosophy of Education</i>, published in 1906, Harris wrote the following:</span></p>

	“Ninety-nine [students] out of a hundred are automata, careful to walk in 
	prescribed paths, careful to follow the prescribed custom. This is not an 
	accident but the result of substantial education, which, scientifically 
	defined, is the subsumption of the individual.”</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">Harris was aided on 
	his quest to eliminate the individual from the student by the emerging 
	ultra-wealthy of America, who had already by this time begun to subvert the 
	political process for their own ends, wielding enormous influence in society 
	and funding the transfer of Harris’ model across the states. One of Harris’ 
	greatest supporters was Andrew Carnegie, who from a poor Scottish immigrant 
	rose to become a super-rich railroad and steel magnate, and was held up as 
	an example of the success of the “American Dream.” In 1889, Carnegie 
	published an essay in the magazine <i>North American Review</i> grandiosely 
	entitled <i>The Gospel of Wealth</i>. Concerned mostly with urging the 
	wealthy to support social causes, it is often held as an example of 
	Carnegie’s humanitarianism. It is, however, much more a veiled call for the 
	wealthy to assume control of society for the benefit of the ignorant masses.

	“This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth: First, to set an

	to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; 
	and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply 
	as trust funds, <i>which he is called upon to administer</i>, and strictly 
	bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, in his 
	judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial result for the

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">It was America’s 
	ultra-rich that pushed and funded the so-called “Progressive Era” at the 
	beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The Rockefellers, Morgans, 
	Mellons, and other ultra-wealthy families of America worked together – 
	indeed, often outright conspired – to seize control of the economy, 
	politics, and society outright. Hegel, who taught that history could be 
	controlled by the deliberate provoking of crises, would have been pleased 
	with the deliberate creation of economic panic in 1907 by the banking 
	cartels, which led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, 
	conceived in secret by the banks themselves, in 1913. In education, it was 
	Harris who led the charge for them. He abolished nearly every educational 
	model that existed before him regardless of its apparent worth, replacing 
	mixed-age single classroom models with age-grading and teacher initiative 
	with a set curriculum of approved topics. The model was being cast for a new 
	society of strict social hierarchy and central control, a society that 
	reached complete fruition in Germany, Hegel’s home, in the 1930s with 
	Nazism.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To their 
	enduring credit, the American universities and their faculty reacted to this 
	shifting towards an “ordered” and “rational” society with concern and 
	occasionally alarm. In 1915 there would still have been a significant number 
	of faculty (from which, at the time, university administration was drawn) 
	who were educated under the previous a-systematic model. Even without this 
	experience, higher education was a place where leaders were taught, where 
	the intellectual elite propagated <span class="GramE">itself</span> (and 
	indeed it was an elite, the number of students continuing on to higher 
	education still in the extreme minority.) Ordering thought in accordance 
	with external and highly abstract intentions was antithetical to this goal, 
	and as academic freedom collapsed on the lower tiers, higher education must 
	have felt understandably threatened. The founding document of the AAUP, the 
	1915 <i>Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure</i> 
	declared the three principles of academic freedom to be “freedom of inquiry 
	and research; freedom of teaching with-in the university or college; and 
	freedom of extramural utterance and action.” These principles specifically 
	counteract the idea of the institutionalization of higher education, holding 
	the <i>individual rights</i> of the faculty as superior to those the 
	university might claim over them.</span></p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fredrick M. 
	Padelford, one of the drafters of the <i>Declaration</i>, brought the AAUP 
	to the University of Washington in 1918. The AAUP helped the UW remain 
	committed to academic freedom up through the 1930s, when a system of tenure 
	and a faculty code enforced the principles of academic freedom, and the 
	establishment of a Faculty Senate established at least a symbolic sharing 
	and decentralization of power. Much of this freedom, however, was lost 
	during the “Red Scare” years following World War Two and the solidification 
	of the Cold War. Issues of origin aside, the Cold War was used increasingly 
	as an excuse to increase state control over the people. It is ironic that 
	both Marx and J.P. Morgan, who had set the foundations for the societies now 
	in conflict, both drew from Hegel as the primary inspiration for their own 
	philosophies. Anti-Communism paranoia swept the country. Washington, long a 
	hotbed of radicalism, began its own Red Scare slightly before McCarthyism 
	brought it to the nation. Radicals were thoroughly expunged from the 
	Democratic Party as a result of massive Republican gains in ‘46 that pointed 
	accusingly at the association between the two, and under conservative 
	Teamster leader Dave Beck and the Communist prohibition in the Taft-Hartley 
	act of 1947 they were driven from the state’s unions. The Committee 
	established by Albert Canwell to investigate Communist activities in 
	Washington State opened hearings in ’48 concerning the University of 
	Washington. The University Administration sought to dismiss six professors 
	in order to clear its name. Of the six – Garland Ethel, Harold Eby, Melville 
	Jacobs, Joseph Butterworth, Herbert Phillips, and Ralph Gundlach – all but 
	Gundlach admitted to being current or former members of the Communist Party. 
	Under the faculty code, a committee had to be formed to review their 
	capabilities as professors, as all six were tenured at the time. The 
	University contended that alliance to “Communist Dogma” rendered them unfit 
	to “seek the truth wherever it may lead” which was their scholarly duty. The 
	Tenure Committee made no clear decisions. It voted to expel only Gundlach, 
	accused to dishonesty for refusing to admit his Communist affiliations. 
	Ethel, Eby, and Jacobs, all former communists, where unanimously let off for 
	supposedly renouncing their beliefs. Phillips and Butterworth, avowed 
	members of the Communist Party, were to be permitted to stay until the 
	University saw fit to amend the faculty code to disallow communists. In the 
	end, however, the decision of the Tenure Committee was meaningless. The 
	final decision belongs to the Board of Regents, appointed by the Governor to 
	oversee University affairs. Dave Beck was one of the Regents, and led a 
	motion to dismiss all six professors which was narrowly defeated 3-4. In the 
	end, Phillips, Butterworth, and Gundlach were dismissed, the other three 
	placed on two-year probation.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AAUP was 
	understandably furious. Not only was the University infringing on the 
	academic freedoms of its members, but the <i>State itself</i> had the final 
	say in their dismissal because of their political affiliations. This action 
	of direct government interference in academia should have terrified the AAUP 
	into immediate action. The specter of full institutionalization of higher 
	education loomed largest during this period, when expunging non-conformist 
	or inappropriate ideas was seen as a matter of national security. However, 
	the AAUP, most likely fearful of becoming demonized itself, issued no 
	statement in support of the six professors beyond vague and unspecified 
	declarations of academic freedom. As a result of their inaction, purges of 
	Communists, real or otherwise, swept across the nations universities, and 
	some 200 professors lost their jobs and were effectively blacklisted from 
	academia. It wasn’t until 1956 that the national body censured the UW for 
	its actions. But by this time the Red Scare was on the decline following 
	McCarthy’s disastrous step-too-far 1954 investigation of the army following 
	which he was stripped of his extra-Constitutional authority. In a series of 
	important decisions, the Supreme Court reversed itself on several 
	anti-Communist decisions to reaffirm First Amendment principles, and the 
	AAUP issued vocal “Friend of the Court” statements to help the Justices make 
	the right decision. The first of these was <i>Sweezy vs. New Hampshire</i> 
	in 1957, where it was decided that University of New Hampshire lecturer was 
	well within his rights of academic freedom to refuse to answer state 
	attorneys questions regarding the content of his lectures. In 1964, another 
	important case, <i>Baggitt vs. Bullitt</i>, declaring loyalty oaths 
	unconstitutional, involved the University of Washington, once more at the 
	forefront of a national trend, this time in the right direction<i>.</i> The 
	final significant reversal of Red Scare policies on the part of the Supreme 
	Court came in 1967 in <i>Keyishian v. Board of Regents</i> which essentially 
	declared it unconstitutional to prevent the hiring of university faculty as 
	consequence of their political views. The faculty were by this time 
	beginning to reassert themselves directly in University politics. In 1954 
	the Administration had canceled a week-long lecture series by noted nuclear 
	physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer for his left-wing views, despite fact that 
	it was he who led the Manhattan Project and thus was “the father of the 
	nuclear bomb,” and despite the science-oriented non-political nature of the 
	lectures. The faculty resisted this move vigorously and the lecture series 
	was reinstated.</span></p>

	campaign for collective bargaining rights began in earnest. This remained

	themselves with expanding and protecting their staff and managing their

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">Universities, 
	particularly large research-oriented institutes, are tying themselves quite 
	needlessly to the market as the desire for increased cash flows becomes seen 
	as all important. Pure research came increasingly under assault in favor of 
	research that could demonstrate an immediate profitable return. Alarmingly, 
	the university administrations are also seeing themselves, often with court 
	approval, as the primary agents of academic freedom. Such rights 
	increasingly are applied to the institution itself and not the individual 
	faculty, increasing the ability of management to override academic freedom 
	for market purposes. To fit the corporate model of academia, tenure also is 
	increasingly under assault, tenure track positions being replaced with the 
	equivalent of temporary workers; part-time professors who will never be 
	granted recognition or tenure track positions for their work. It is as if 
	Harris’ Hegelianism has finally begun to move up to higher education, but 
	that is perhaps a simplistic view. The new model university increasingly 
	resembles a business dedicated to creating students with the skills 
	necessary to enter the economy. The University of Washington is struggling 
	with these very problems directly. Corporations are increasing their 
	influence over it through massive donations. Bill Gates and Paul Allen fund 
	computer centers and law schools despite savage financial needs in other 
	areas, and the administration roles out the red carpet to encourage them to 
	donate ever more. One would be right to recall Carnegie’s <i>Gospel of 
	Wealth</i>, for there would seem little doubt that the two Microsoft 
	founders have read it. They can easily be seen as model Carnegieans, staying 
	away from the public eye and increasing dependent of social institutions 
	upon their donations and the state itself upon their continued corporate 
	presence in the economy. Is it any wonder that the Board of Regents has 
	those with corporate ties in majority, a former CEO as Board President, and 
	Bill Gates’ father on it? The effect is felt not only on the faculty, but on 
	the student body. Corporations campaign on campus under the guise of career 
	fairs, and the students are responding, seeking less and less to satisfy 
	their own educational curiosities and are instead entering professional 
	degree programs as quickly as possible. The conclusions are possible stark: 
	education is being roped to a model of corporatism that does little to allow 
	freedom or thought and gives little thought to the progress of the nation 
	and of American society, instead seeking the maintenance and enhancement of 
	existing paradigms that exist solely to serve the interests of wealth. After 
	all, universities have always been a business seeking to provide a product 
	to a consumer. Except, once upon a time, the product was education and the 
	consumer was the student. Now, we must fear, the product has become 
	indoctrination, the consumer big business.</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana;    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	organization of GSEAC and the increased activity of the AAUP in the past few 
	years, culminating in collective bargaining rights, have driven the 
	differing views of higher education into stark contrast. On one side is the 
	administration, building an institution dedicating to filling the 
	requirements of the market. On the other stand the tenuous organizations of 
	faculty and academic employees, not entirely certain of what they represent, 
	but demanding the freedom to figure it out for themselves. These are the 
	champions of education, those who offer choice and growth to those who will 
	grow to make this country anew in their image. Andrew Carnegie’s vision for 
	a future where the wealthy control us and those institutions we created for 
	our benefit may or may not yet come to full fruition, but it will never feel 
	complete victory until the AAUP, GSEAC, and organizations like them have 
	long fallen by the wayside, dead and forgotten.</span></p>
