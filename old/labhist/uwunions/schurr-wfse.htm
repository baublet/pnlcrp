		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April of 2001, the Washington Federation of State Employees 
		(WFSE) launched a ten-week campaign of rolling walkouts.&nbsp; It was the 
		first such action in WFSE’s history and, despite a looming state budget 
		crisis, it was very successful.&nbsp; In July, the union declared victory; it 
		had won a salary increase of 3.7%, gained better health care benefits, 
		reduced the number of proposed layoffs, and prevented privatization of 
		state highway maintenance.&nbsp; Just eight months later, in April of 2002, 
		the union won the right to collective bargaining for the first time.&nbsp; 
		These victories didn’t happen over night – they were the product of more 
		than sixty years of organizing history.</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WFSE was chartered as Council 28 of the American Federation of 
		State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in November of 1943, but 
		its history begins about five years earlier.&nbsp; Organized labor in 
		Washington, a state with one of the strongest labor movements in the 
		country, won a $100 per month minimum wage for state employees in the 
		late 1930s.&nbsp; In 1938, a group of Pierce County welfare caseworkers, 
		known as “visitors,” began to agitate for a salary increase, arguing 
		that they were in fact state workers and were thus entitled to the newly 
		won minimum wage.&nbsp; Under the leadership of a visitor named Neville 
		Crippen, they took over a management-sponsored employee association and 
		sought affiliation with AFSCME, which at this time was rapidly 
		organizing public workers throughout the country.&nbsp; With AFSCME’s help, 
		the visitors filed suit against the state.&nbsp; While the case wound its way 
		through court, AFSCME helped other Washington State workers to 
		organize.&nbsp; A declaration by Governor Arthur Langlie that state workers 
		had the right to unionize facilitated the effort.&nbsp; By 1941, when the 
		Washington State Supreme Court ruled in favor of AFSCME and the Pierce 
		County visitors, another seventeen state locals had formed in Washington 
		covering employees in Labor and Industries, Institutions, 
		Transportation, and Human Services.&nbsp; Representatives from these locals 
		met with representatives from the visitors’ local, Pierce County Local 
		53, in August of 1942.&nbsp; They voted to band together and form an AFSCME 
		state employee council.&nbsp; On November 18, 1943, the Washington Federation 
		of State Employees was officially chartered as Council 28 of AFSCME.&nbsp;

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 350 members of Council 28 joined a national organization 
		that was growing at a phenomenal rate.&nbsp; AFSCME was established as an 
		independent American Federation of Labor (AFL) charter in 1936 and in 
		the following decade its membership grew over 700% – from 10,000 to 
		73,000 members.<a title name="_ednref1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Organized labor was growing all over the country at this time but AFSCME 
		enjoyed particularly impressive success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WFSE was part of this explosive growth for a while.&nbsp; Edwin 
		Alexander of Olympia was elected the first president and Neville Crippen 
		was elected vice president at the 1942 meeting.&nbsp; Together they worked on 
		growing the union’s membership.&nbsp; The following year, Crippen was elected 
		president and then from 1944 to 1946 he served as the union’s sole paid 
		organizer.&nbsp; In just three years the number of members grew to about 
		1,800 – an increase of more than 500% – but a period of internal strife 
		brought this growth to a halt.&nbsp; In the five years from 1945 to 1950, 
		WFSE had no fewer than six presidents, Crippen returned to his state 
		job, membership fell to about 500, and the union was nearly bankrupted.</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This dismal trend was finally reversed in 1950 when a group of 
		union officers led by Wilbur Rice was elected on a platform of union 
		reform.&nbsp; Rice hired Norm Schut, former aide to Governor Langlie, as 
		Executive Director in December of 1952, a position he held for the next 
		twenty years.&nbsp; Rice and Schut refocused the union on the core issues 
		that affected its members: hours, wages, benefits, and working 
		conditions.&nbsp; At that time, Schut recalled, “the wages [of state 
		employees] were very low.&nbsp; The fringe benefits were next to nothing.&nbsp; 
		The status of a state employee in the minds of the public, but mostly in 
		the minds of the rest of the labor movement and of the news media … was 
		nothing.&nbsp; The legislators treated [state employees and the union] as 
		something that wasn’t worthy of being given consideration.”<a title name="_ednref2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Many members were working very long hours and WFSE focused its first 
		lobbying efforts on this problem, scoring a major legislative victory in 
		1953.&nbsp; The passage of a bill extending the 40-hour workweek to state 
		employees did a lot to increase the status of the union in the eyes of 
		potential members.&nbsp; Recruiting accelerated and soon the membership had 
		more than made up the losses of the late 1940s, reaching about 2,500 by 
		1954.&nbsp; </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WFSE next turned its attention to the elimination of the 
		so-called “spoils system” of state employment.&nbsp; The spoils system, the 
		practice of hiring and firing state employees based on political loyalty 
		rather than merit, made union organizing particularly difficult.&nbsp; Many 
		workers were afraid to organize, afraid even to be noticed at all, 
		because every four years when a new governor was elected they were 
		liable to lose their jobs.&nbsp; The new governor could reward political 
		supporters with state jobs and state employees could be fired for 
		supporting the losing candidate.&nbsp; Under these conditions, many employees 
		chose to keep their political views private.&nbsp; In fact, Wanda Riley of 
		Olympia Local 443 recalled that at Labor and Industries in the pre-civil 
		service days, “[you] didn’t say a word about anything.&nbsp; You just 
		worked.&nbsp; [You’d] be fearing for your job every four years.&nbsp; And if the 
		supervisor didn’t like you, it might be sooner than four years.”<a title name="_ednref3" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The union lobbied hard throughout the 1950s for a merit-based civil 
		service employment system, through the administrations of Republican 
		Governor Langlie and Democratic Governor Rosellini alike, but it was to 
		no avail.&nbsp; </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		A merit-based employment system, however, was not just in the interest 
		of state employees; it was in the interest of the public as well.&nbsp; It 
		was simply a much more efficient way to run state government.&nbsp; 
		Frustrated by the lack of progress in Olympia, WFSE decided to take 
		their case to the voters.&nbsp; In January of 1960, the union filed a 
		petition for what would become Initiative 207, the Civil Service 
		Initiative.&nbsp; Getting the more than 90,000 signatures required to put the 
		initiative on the November ballot required help from the rest of 
		Washington’s labor movement and WFSE worked hard to convince the 
		Washington Labor Council to join the battle.&nbsp; With their help, enough 
		signatures were gathered by the June deadline and, in November of 1960, 
		Washington voters passed the initiative.&nbsp; </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This success bolstered union organizing and the 1960s saw huge 
		gains in WFSE membership, as well as in AFSCME membership nationwide.<a title name="_ednref4" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		It also saw a big expansion in Washington’s public higher education 
		system.&nbsp; The number of Washington State college students more than 
		tripled in two decades and this necessitated a big growth in the number 
		of employees at Washington colleges.<a title name="_ednref5" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		When George Starkovich (quoted above) arrived as a gardener at the 
		University of Washington in January of 1965, WFSE Local 1488 was poorly 
		organized and had only about 150 to 200 members – a small fraction of 
		the university’s employees.&nbsp; Starkovich was an experienced union member 
		who had served as secretary of a miner’s union and shop steward at a 
		plywood plant in Bellingham.&nbsp; He joined Local 1488 and, with president 
		Fred Rollins, began to work on growing the union.&nbsp; “You had to persuade 
		people to join,” Starkovich recalled, “and you had to persuade them 
		ideologically because it was the rare increase you got.”<a title name="_ednref6" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		There were simply too few members for the union to have much power.&nbsp; “In 
		those days, you had to go over to the administration building and, as 
		the old saying goes, hat in hand, beg for whatever you wanted,” he 
		said.&nbsp; “The union had no contract and it was several years before we got 
		one.&nbsp; They sort of recognized us but not in legal terms.&nbsp; They would sit 
		down with us, they would hear us out, but they were not under pressure 
		to do anything like say at Stillicum State Hospital where they were 100% 
		union or the Highway Department where they were 100% union.&nbsp; So those 
		workers all got better wages than at the university.”</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation created a catch-22 for Local 1488.&nbsp; The 
		membership was so small that the university workers were a low priority 
		for the WFSE leadership.&nbsp; As Starkovich recalled, “the union wasn’t 
		sending an organizer in. &nbsp;They said ‘you’re on your own, we go where the 
		union members pay their dues.’”&nbsp; WFSE’s emphasis on serving current 
		members, the “servicing model” of union operation, made it difficult for 
		Local 1488 to grow.&nbsp; At the same time, the low wages meant that there 
		was a high turnover rate for university employees and this made 
		organizing even more difficult.&nbsp; Of the employees that stayed at the 
		university some were reluctant to join the union for fear of losing 
		their jobs but many more, according to Starkovich, were just “very 
		opportunistic.”&nbsp; “Their attitude was ‘when you get something for me, 
		I’ll join,’” he said.&nbsp; Little by little, however, the local was able to 
		grow the membership and become a force on campus.&nbsp; Starkovich estimates 
		that by 1970, they had about seven or eight hundred members.&nbsp; </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starkovich realized early on that in order to expand, the 
		local would have to do a better job of including women and minorities:&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 10pt">“One of the things I 
		found out was that in the janitorial department there were at least two 
		or three white bosses that were anti-black, they were racist actually.&nbsp; 
		I decided to deal with that situation and recruit some blacks to deal 
		with the problem with me.&nbsp; About the time that black students were 
		fighting for the right to enter the university on scholarships I 
		proposed to the management that they set up a committee with us so that 
		we could start making it more fair for black employees to get jobs in 
		various departments.&nbsp; [Then University of Washington President] Odegaard 
		agreed to it around 1968 or 70.&nbsp; I went out of my way to work with the 
		blacks in janitorial and a couple other places.&nbsp; And then some blacks 
		came to work at the gardening department, and they started being much 
		more active in the union.” </span></p>

		He also worked to recruit women into the union.&nbsp; In the late 1960s and 
		early 1970s, the mostly female dormitory housekeepers were paid less 
		than the mostly male janitors that Local 1488 represented despite the 
		fact that they did almost the same work.&nbsp; The local lobbied the 
		university administration to raise the housekeepers' pay and even won 
		them a two-year back pay settlement.&nbsp; This success brought some of the 
		women into the union.&nbsp; “We always kept agitating that what was good for 
		one person was good for another,” said Starkovich, “that it was good for 
		us even though comparative worth helped people who weren’t yet in the 
		union.”</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach was not endorsed by all of the WFSE members, 
		however.&nbsp; There was, in fact, a growing frustration among many 
		dues-paying members throughout the state that co-workers who didn’t join 
		the union still enjoyed the fruits of union success.&nbsp; In 1973, Norm 
		Schut quietly lobbied the legislature and the Evans administration for a 
		union shop law that would allow workers to vote to require union 
		membership as a condition of employment.&nbsp; The union decided to keep the 
		issue low-key because, in Schut’s colorful words, “[i]t’s frequently 
		better not to break the crust on the manure pile [and] there was going 
		to be enough just basic opposition to a union shop without our 
		broadcasting the fact.”<a title name="_ednref7" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Schut expertly guided the bill through the legislature and the Union 
		Shop Bill was passed in March of 1973.&nbsp; Over the next year WFSE 
		membership took another big jump, reaching 13,700 in 1974.<a title name="_ednref8" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1973, WFSE launched a high profile fight to achieve equal 
		pay for men and women doing comparable jobs.&nbsp; At WFSE’s request, 
		Governor Dan Evans appointed a commission to investigate wage 
		disparities in state employment.&nbsp; The commission found that women earned 
		about 20% less than men doing similar jobs, but the Evans administration 
		did little about it.&nbsp; Governor Dixie Lee Ray, Evans’ successor, did even 
		less; in fact, she actively undid the little progress that had been 
		made.&nbsp; In 1980, WFSE filed a grievance with the federal Equal Employment 
		Opportunity Commission (EEOP).&nbsp; In 1982, after the anti-union Reagan 
		administration appointees at the EEOP predictably failed to act on the 
		grievance, WFSE filed suit in the U. S. District Court, charging the 
		state with violating the Civil Rights Act and the Washington Equal 
		Rights Act.&nbsp; In December of 1985, twelve years after WFSE requested the 
		original study, the State of Washington agreed to pay 482 million 
		dollars in back pay and to phase-in a comparable worth program that 
		would begin in 1986 and end in 1992.</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of the comparative worth fight, and indeed of 
		every fight WFSE has waged in the last two decades, was made possible in 
		part by a struggle that took place at the 1978 State Convention in 
		Spokane.&nbsp; Prior to 1978, a flat fee deducted from the members' paychecks 
		funded WFSE.&nbsp; That meant that the lowest paid state employees paid the 
		same dues as the highest paid, which, in addition to being rather 
		unfair, set a low cap on the amount of money the union could raise.&nbsp; It 
		also meant that the union’s funding could not easily keep pace with 
		inflation since every adjustment to the dues fee had to be negotiated 
		and voted on at a convention.&nbsp; Many local unions charged higher dues and 
		kept the money in their own organizations, building up large local 
		treasuries.&nbsp; According to Starkovich, however, having “a strong local 
		here and a strong local there” was no way to run a statewide 
		organization, especially one that relied on lobbying lawmakers to 
		achieve most of its objectives.&nbsp; “We needed to have a dues structure 
		that helped to build the state organization,” he said.&nbsp; At the Spokane 
		convention, union leadership proposed a percentage dues structure that 
		would keep pace with rising wages.&nbsp; Some of the large institution 
		locals, however, were reluctant to give up power, and the motion was 
		defeated.&nbsp; According to the history published on the WFSE website, 
		George Starkovich convinced President Jorgenson to bring the motion up 
		one more time after the noon recess.<a title name="_ednref9" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		During the break, Starkovich and Jorgenson divided up the locals and 
		began lobbying for the proposal.&nbsp; They convinced Bob Sass, president of 
		the Western State Hospital Local 793, to support an amended version of 
		the proposal.&nbsp; The compromise specified that any money left over after 
		expenses would be put into a shared reserve fund to be split between the 
		locals and the state council.&nbsp; After the recess, the amended motion was 
		raised again and passed.&nbsp; Starkovich downplayed his own role but 
		acknowledged the importance of the measure.&nbsp; “In the long pull of 
		things,” he said, “that’s what changed everything.&nbsp; It gave financial 
		stability to the union.” </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That financial stability has paid off.&nbsp; Throughout the 1980s 
		while organized labor suffered a string of defeats and union membership 
		declined nationwide for the first time since the Depression, WFSE and 
		AFSCME continued to grow.&nbsp; In fact, WFSE membership increased by about a 
		third in the 1980s while AFSCME membership went up by about a quarter.&nbsp; 
		What were these unions doing right?&nbsp; Starkovich speculates that one 
		reason for their continued success lies in the fact that they got a jump 
		on organizing low paid and vulnerable workers.&nbsp; “These were workers that 
		had never been organized and no one else [in organized labor] wanted to 
		touch them,” he said.&nbsp; There is also sometimes an increase in political 
		awareness that comes with working for the government that can make state 
		workers more aware of what needs to be done to protect their rights.&nbsp; 
		“Our union was always more political than others because we had to get 
		things from the legislature,” said Starkovich.&nbsp; He and other AFSCME 
		members often campaigned for sympathetic legislators and were sometimes 
		able to turn that support into gains for their union.&nbsp; “Everything moves 
		at a snail’s pace,” he said, “[but] we kept chipping away at it and the 
		average pay and conditions are pretty good for state employees now.”&nbsp;
		</p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger is that these hard-fought gains could be eliminated 
		in the future.&nbsp; Indeed, one of the most striking things about WFSE’s 
		yearly list of legislative accomplishments is the sheer repetitiveness 
		of the issues that the union has to fight against.<a title name="_ednref10" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The same destructive proposals surface year after year; efforts to 
		contract-out state work, to reduce employee benefits, to pass 
		“right-to-work” legislation, or to lay off state workers are mounted in 
		nearly every legislative session.&nbsp; Union officials have to fight the 
		same battles over and over again and it’s hard to believe that the 
		constant struggle wouldn’t get discouraging.&nbsp; “You gotta believe in it,” 
		said Starkovich.&nbsp; “They use the word labor movement; it’s like a 
		political movement.&nbsp; And luckily, a new generation of workers comes 
		along when the old generation gets tired.” </p>
		<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 1in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
		Starkovich points to John Frazer, current president of Local 1488, as 
		evidence of the energy of the new generation.&nbsp; He played a key part in 
		bringing about the rolling walkouts of spring 2001 and is actively 
		preparing to capitalize on the opportunities offered by the new 
		collective bargaining law.<a title name="_ednref11" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		While some in his generation may agree with Norm Schut when he said that 
		“nothing is more boring than for somebody my age to try to tell them the 
		history, how hard we fought and won these battles…” Frazer is aware that 
		part of the power of the union today is the product of its long history 
		of organizing.<a title name="_ednref12" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		“I know that the history is important,” he said, “but, to tell you the 
		truth, I prefer to focus on the present.&nbsp; We have power because of what 
		happened in the past but how we use it is what counts.”<a title name="_ednref13" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		By being ready to strike, by knowing the contract inside out and filing 
		grievance after grievance, by maintaining high visibility to the members 
		and the administration the union under Frazer acts as it did in 
		Starkovich’s day; it provides a measure of dignity for the workers.&nbsp; “We 
		don’t let them dump on the least powerful,” he said, “we are the team 
		that can fight back.”&nbsp; </p>
