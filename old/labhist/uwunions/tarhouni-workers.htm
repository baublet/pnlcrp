	How often do you catch the name pinned to the shirt of the person who serves 
	you a plate of teriyaki in the Husky Union Building? How often do you have a 
	conversation with the cashier at By George? For the average student or

	The presence of food workers at the University of Washington is marked by 
	invisibility in the realm of the “real” campus—the highly visible world of 
	classes, office hours, faculty meetings, student organizations, guest 
	speakers and residence hall life.&nbsp; Like custodians, office staff, librarians 
	and many other workers essential for the operation of a large university, 
	food workers labor in an ironic juxtaposition of omnipresence and 
	invisibility. On one hand, a glance at the student newspaper, <i>The Daily,</i> 
	reveals dialogues preoccupied with student politics, local environmental 
	issues, and life in the Greek system. Rare is the article that mentions food 
	service or food workers. Yet students make up the majority of those served 
	by Housing and Food Services, the University of Washington’s department for 
	residence hall and on campus-dining whose mission is, “T<span style="color: black">o 
	provide quality food at reasonable prices to our guests in a clean, safe, 
	attractive environment, while providing exemplary service to students, 
	faculty, staff and visitors of the University of Washington.”<a title name="_ednref1" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a></span></p>

	If you put down the paper and take another look you’ll see that food service 
	workers are everywhere—working in one of the 19 food outlets on campus, in 
	the kitchens, on the frontline. The rhythm of work begins early. In the 
	shadowy dawn of each workday – while most students are either fast asleep or 
	pulling all-nighters in the confines of Odegaard library – parking lots all 
	over campus begin to fill with workers arriving for their 6am shift. 
	Battered carpools drive up behind residence halls and behind the Husky Union 
	Building (HUB). Other workers alight from busses, crossing the dim and empty 
	streets to start the first work of the day. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Who are these workers, how long have they been here, and how are they 
	unionized? What are their hours? What has drawn them to the University, and, 
	especially for those who have worked here 20 plus years, what has made them 
	stay?</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Classified food service workers at UW have been organized under Local 1488 
	of the Washington Federation of State Employees since 1978.<a title name="_ednref2" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Yet most people who work for Housing and Food services remain non-union. 
	This is because only classified staff is part of the union—the rest of the 
	workers fall into non-unionized student, hourly, or professional labor. As I 
	began to look for the lives of the average unionized food service worker I 
	quickly discovered that the lives of union members are intricately bound 
	with the many other classifications of workers who toil alongside them. Only 
	by examining both sides is it possible to understand how the union can 
	protect some workers while seemingly undermining the livelihood of others.</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	I found that the vast majority of workers at HFS are <i>not</i> classified 
	staff. Middle management consists of managers and manager/chefs, all of whom 
	are non-unionized professional staff. Under the professionals is a varying 
	amount of classified staff members, usually around 10, in the residence 
	halls cafeterias. Then there is the large numbers of part time student and 
	hourly workers. Student workers must work less than 20 hours per week. 
	Hourly workers work anywhere from 5 to 40 hours per week, but under 
	Washington State Law, must leave when their hours add up to more than 1050 
	within one year. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
	In recent years outcries against abuse of temporary workers have become 
	louder. “Hourly” or “temporary” workers recently were limited to 1050 hours 
	per year by the Washington State Legislature in an effort to curb practices 
	of hiring “permatemps” or workers who toil indefinitely without benefits, 
	insurance or union membership. The law was passed in response to several 
	high profile lawsuits.&nbsp; One such lawsuit was the one filed against Microsoft 
	contending that it employed temporary workers in a fulltime capacity on an 
	ongoing basis but denied them adequate compensation and benefits. Microsoft 
	lost the long running case and was forced to pay workers back compensation 
	and interest on benefits.&nbsp; Another of these lawsuits happened in 1997 when 
	the State of Washington settled a class-action lawsuit brought by more than 
	500 part-time and temporary employees. Yet another occurred in 1998 where 
	the Labor Department sued Time-Warner, the media giant, for denying benefits 
	to workers allegedly misclassified as temporary workers. Across the country, 
	similar cases have attempted to address the increasing reliance on temporary 
	workers.</p>

	<u>Will Teach for Food: Academic Labor in Crisis</u>, a collection of essays 
	published in 1997, addresses the reliance on graduate students and adjunct 
	(re: temporary) faculty at major institutions across the country. Striking 
	similarities between the situation of hourly workers in the lofty academic 
	fields and those in unskilled food service create an illuminating symmetry 
	at both “ends” of the university job market. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	In her essay “Disposable Faculty: Part-Time Exploitation as Management 
	Strategy,” Linda Ray Pratt observes that as a “part-time” faculty member, 
	“You are teaching six courses a year but are still called ‘part-time,’ even 
	though full-time faculty members typically teach three courses per 
	semester.”<a title name="_ednref3" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This situation is mirrored in the way that Housing and Food Services at the 
	University of Washington “gets around” the 1050 rule by using part-time 
	workers on a full-time basis for approximately four months and then letting 
	them go, as demonstrated by profiled food service worker Arturo Sandino’s 
	situation. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	The phenomenon of hiring these workers back at the beginning of a new year, 
	when they “get” a new set of hours is particularly devious.&nbsp; &quot;Rebecca&quot; (not 
	her real name), a middle-management professional employee at the University 
	of Washington remarks, “In this way, some people have worked here for more 
	than eight years.” The same is true for part-time faculty as Pratt 
	discusses, “Part-time faculty can usually qualify for up to twenty-six weeks 
	of unemployment compensation after working for the institution four months…I 
	have known part-time faculty members who sustained themselves between 
	appointments in just this way.” A pivotal difference of course, is that HFS 
	hourly workers are not entitled to twenty-six weeks of compensation, and 
	usually simply have to find another temporary job to sustain them until they 
	can be rehired. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Pratt also discusses the despair inherent in this blatantly exploitative 
	system in academia, “The letter of appointment will also contain the notice 
	of termination.”<a title name="_ednref4" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a> 
	As &quot;Yunis,&quot; another food service worker says, “When you sign the paper, you 
	feel like, ‘great!’ you found a job—then they fire you.” </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	I interviewed seven food service workers in several different facilities at 
	the University of Washington, three classified staff, three hourly staff and 
	one professional. Their names have been changed for this report. The 
	personal stories which follow are indicative only of their own experiences, 
	and do not purport to speak for other workers on campus. From speaking with 
	FSW workers at all levels of classification, a picture emerged of workers 
	who span a broad array of education level, race, ethnicity, age and, due to 
	this vast diversity, all had different hopes for the future. Nevertheless, 
	all felt a certain amount of ambivalence about the “union” in large part 
	because they feel that it conspires, whether consciously or not, with the 
	money-holding academic institution and the state legislature to keep hourly 
	workers eking out a barely livable wage with few options for the future. </p>

	I interviewed “Erika” one weekday morning as she was routinely cleaning the 
	espresso maker at one HFS Restaurant.<a title name="_ednref6" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a> 
	Our conversation was intermittently interrupted by the droning of the coffee 
	grinder and thirsty students stopping to ask for double lattes in their rush 
	to class. Erika, a white, middle-aged single mother, begins her days early, 
	and was already half done with her shift by 10:30 am. She typically arrived 
	at HFS by 6am, after dropping off her young daughter at daycare. The first 
	hour of her morning consists of set-up before the café opens at 7am and 
	throngs of hungry students flood its small space. </p>

	A Food Service Worker Lead (FSW) Erika is in charge of “cold line.” Her area 
	of supervision includes the drip coffees, which must be restocked, plus the 
	sugars, straws, honeys and lids; the fresh fruit bar; the Boss Tucker 
	sandwich bar; the scone, muffin, donut and croissant trays; a deli where 
	sandwiches are made to order; the soup bar, the chip, cookie and dry cereal 
	racks; the espresso bar and two cash registers. She supervises an average of 
	five employees at any given time – all of them either student or hourly 
	workers. As we speak, Erika is relaxed and easy going, leaning against the 
	wall to talk to me in the absence of customers. As soon as customers walk 
	up, however, she immediately asks them “How can I help you sir?” (Or ma’am). 
	I was impressed and surprised by her formality and the emphasis she places 
	on customer service.</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Erika began a career in food service at a small college in Vancouver, WA 
	where she learned to bake. While working there, a friend convinced her to 
	submit a resume to an ad that wanted a deli/baker. She got the job, and 
	although she was disappointed to find that it was almost all deli and no 
	baking, she kept the job while in school. Later, she moved to Seattle and 
	while looking for a job, applied at a grocery store &quot;since all of my 
	experience was in deli.” She stayed at her grocery store job for several 
	years &quot;for the union and the benefits,” and had a child. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	At the grocery store she was in the retail clerks union, and although she 
	never had to file a grievance, she always paid her dues. She began working 
	at HFS two years ago, and has found that “I’m used to working straight. Here 
	I don’t have to work so hard.” She sent her resume in on the advice of a 
	friend and since she considered herself under-qualified; she never thought 
	that she would get the job. Much to her surprise, she was offered the FSW 
	lead job soon after her interview, and told her supervisor, “I don’t need to 
	think about it, I’ll take it.” Eager to get a job with regular hours and 
	good pay, Erika says, “I wanted a job where I knew they had a union and I 
	would get benefits. At my old job, I had benefits, but they only paid me 
	about eight dollars an hour. So I had to work six days a week, and that was 
	too much.” At HFS, Erika works Sunday through Thursday, and can be home 
	every afternoon, although “I have to go to bed really early.” </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Erika considers herself a staunch union supporter, although she doesn’t go 
	to meetings (they’re too late) and acknowledges that she doesn’t actively 
	participate. Still, she considers the union a good thing and is grateful for 
	the benefits and security it provides. She muses, “They can’t just fire you. 
	There’s a whole process… you have rights. I could call my union rep.” In 
	fact, Erika has had several phone conversations with her union 
	representative, although she’s never met her in person and can’t remember if 
	her name is Judy or Julie. Most recently, when Erika had to leave her job 
	unexpectedly for emergency surgery, she called her union rep to ask a 
	question about signing her hospital release form. “I wanted to make sure 
	they (HFS) couldn’t just fire me…and she said ‘call me if they try to! You 
	do have rights!’” she remembers. Erika compares her position to the hourly 
	workers by saying, “If one of them had to have surgery, they probably 
	would’ve lost their job. But me, I have something to come back to. “ </p>

	At the Retail Clerks union, you had to take three unpaid sick days before 
	you could begin using your paid sick days. “Here,” she says, “it’s better.” 
	However, she feels the union is not very visible at UW, unlike her previous 
	job at the grocery store, where the union rep would come around and “Check 
	in on us.”</p>

	Erika also supports the union’s efforts to increase pay, although she is 
	well aware that there is currently a freeze on wages. Still, she is not yet 
	at the top of her scale “Unlike a lot of people here, I’m one of the newest 
	classified workers” and still has one more raise coming. Although in theory 
	she supports the right to strike, she says that she “Just can’t. I’m the 
	sole supporter. One day’s pay cut hurts at the end of the month. Last year, 
	when they were talking about going out on strike, I told them…I couldn’t, I 
	have a daughter and I <i>have</i> to work, and they were fine because they 
	understood my situation.”</p>

	Her sister works for the Seattle Times, which went on a strike last year 
	that ended up practically breaking the union, and had a similar experience. 
	Erika said, “She has a son and husband so…yes, she crossed the picket 
	line…she was thinking about getting another job, but she didn’t end up doing 
	that.” </p>

	“Kayo” is staring at me intently, with fierce dark eyes under a shock of 
	dyed-red hair. He rips his gloves off his hands and wipes them on his dark 
	vintage jeans and says, “Come with me.” Kayo has just finished his nightly 
	cold line shift at HFS Restaurant, which he ends by closing the deli bar. 
	After stocking all of the leftover meat, cheese and vegetables in freezers 
	in the back, tossing out old bagels, wrapping up bread, sweeping the floor, 
	and wiping down the counters, Kayo is ready to talk. His statement above is 
	a typical indication of the balance he maintains between a confident 
	optimism in his own abilities and his future, and the reality that he faces 
	as a foreigner in the United States. Kayo came to Seattle from Turkey a&nbsp; few 
	years ago. After taking ESL classes for three months, he started work at the 
	cafe as an hourly worker and has been there ever since. He averages 16-20 
	hours per week, and has worked “almost everything.” That includes serving 
	food and working the grill in addition to his current cold line duties. </p>

	Kayo is a student at another college in Seattle, but because he is not at 
	UW,&nbsp; he is an hourly worker, not a student worker. His passion is media, 
	especially music, and he says about working at HFS, “It’s not the perfect 
	thing, I would prefer a job that I would find in music or movies, but for 
	now it’s fine…” He found his job at HFS through another native of his 
	country, “Yunis,” who arrived here almost four years ago. Kayo and Yunis 
	have been friends for seven years, and Kayo will be best man at Yunis’s 
	wedding this summer.<a title name="_ednref7" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></p>

	Kayo finds the stability and freedom of his “day job” attractive, although 
	he receives neither benefits nor any guarantee of further employment. He has 
	also bonded with one of his managers, a fellow musician. He says the “people 
	who work here” are the best thing about his job, although his artistic 
	sensibilities are injured by the café’s bland and bright décor. About his 
	working environment he says, “Yeah, I would add some art, you know, music, a 
	little redecoration, something different from the regular cafeteria. That’s 
	how I think—you should do things differently.” </p>

	Kayo is biding his time until he can find a “serious group of musicians” 
	with which he can collaborate on a regular basis as a songwriter. He is also 
	looking for another job somewhere in the music business, possibly a record 
	shop. “It’s really hard for a foreigner to live in the United States,” he 
	says, “My parents send me money of course, they’re paying for the school, 
	but I have a part time job so I can pay my expenses.” </p>

	Because of the independent nature of his previous jobs – where he worked as 
	a musician in bars and clubs – Kayo has never belonged to a union, nor does 
	he particularly want to. Asked about his situation as an hourly worker, he 
	says, “I don’t know about those things.” He feels his hourly wage, although 
	“not enough” is fair for now, and doesn’t particularly feel it is important 
	to invest time in changing the situation since he sees himself leaving this 
	job within a year. As long as he has money from his parents as a security 
	blanket and his dreams of music and media to sustain his hopeful outlook, he 
	cannot conceive of depending on HFS wages for his livelihood. His view of 
	his future, perhaps a reflection of his age, is singularly individualistic. 
	He says he plans to stay in the United States, “Long enough to record some 
	songs, shoot some movies, in Turkish and English together…I’m saying this 
	like it will happen. I’m believing what I’m doing and I’m gonna work hard 
	and get what I can.” He says that the pressure of friends’ expectations is 
	urging him on, “They’re expecting things from me at home. That makes you 
	more willing…when you have friends behind you expecting things from you.”</p>

	<span style="font-weight: normal">His view of unions, which he calls “social 
	groups,” is much more guarded than his personal outlook. He says, “I believe 
	if every individual does what they’re supposed to do, we don’t need that 
	kind of stuff. When I look at that (unions) they’re just commercializing it, 
	degrading it, I like to be optimistic, but it’s not gonna change…you just 
	gotta figure something else out. I mean, I have always had this rebellious 
	streak but…” Kayo stares at his hands, choosing his words slowly and 
	carefully, “In Turkey there are unions on every corner. Some smarty guy or 
	smarty girl shows up and gets the money out of these young people who are 
	thinking they will be changing things by marching in the streets…nah.” He 
	leans back in his chair and grins. “Nothing changes.” </span><!--mstheme--></font><!--mstheme--></b></h1>

	“Arturo” is an hourly worker at a different HFS facility. Like Kayo and 
	Yunis, Arturo is an immigrant to this country. He arrived in Seattle from 
	Mexico 10 years ago and has worked a variety of low-paying jobs in food 
	service at places like Starbucks, World Wraps and the Crab Pot. Currently, 
	in addition to his 28 hours per week at HFS, Arturo works 40 hours in a 
	upscale Seattle restaurant, where he’s been cooking pasta and making pizza’s 
	since 1994. Like Kayo, Arturo heard about the opening at HFS through a 
	friend, “Memo,” who also works at the Seattle restaurant. Until recently, 
	Memo made stir-fry at HFS, but he has since been asked to leave because his 
	temporary hours have given out. Now Arturo works the stir-fry, in addition 
	to making pizzas and serving food in the line.&nbsp; </p>

	When Arturo started working at HFS his hours were Fridays through Sundays,

	hours, management restored his Friday through Sunday shift. Now Arturo works 
	every weekday evening from 4-8pm, plus an eight-hour shift on Saturdays. 
	Recently management has told Arturo that his hours are up and he will have 
	to leave by June 14th. However, he’s been told that if he leaves a number 
	where he can be reached, they will call him in September and he will most 
	likely be able to come back to work. </p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Sandi” is the oldest employee at her HFS restaurant. She has 
	worked there for fourteen years and has spent a total of 25 years working at 
	the University. For the past fourteen years she has been a Food Service 
	Lead, and like Erika, she starts her job at 6am. She does “Whatever's 
	needed,” but has a general routine where she stocks the salad bar and fills 
	fruit containers. She doesn’t officially supervise anyone, but says she is 
	constantly giving advice to the students and hourly staff or showing them 
	where things are. She says, “I’ve been here longer, so I can show them how 
	to do something faster.” She plans to retire in the near future, perhaps as 
	soon as two years, and likes the work at HFS because she likes the 
	independent nature of the job.&nbsp; Before working at HFS, Sandi worked at 
	another residence hall on campus, and previous to that she worked in a 
	sorority kitchen on Greek row. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The food service workers were not yet organized when Sandi joined 
	the union, so joining wasn’t mandatory but she says chose to do so anyway 
	because “There was such a strong anti-labor feeling at that time…I felt 
	there had to be some collective action.” Sandi says that when she first 
	began working, in the 1960’s, she was wary of the unions. Even when she came 
	to work at UW in 1977, she initially stayed away from them. However, after 
	studying labor history on her own, and learning more about the plight of 
	early garment workers who worked long hours in terrible conditions, Sandi 
	became more sympathetic to the local, and decided she would do whatever is 
	necessary to raise living conditions. Another event that occurred in the 
	late seventies further swayed her to the union cause.&nbsp; A close friend of 
	hers had a brother who worked in a mine in Idaho. At the time his mine was 
	not unionized, and when he lost his eye in a mining accident, he also lost 
	his job without compensation. Sandi says that after that, she decided she 
	would support strikes on campus for better working conditions and benefits.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirteen years ago, Sandi did participate in a protest for better 
	treatment, although she didn’t actually have to strike since it was her day 
	off.&nbsp; She remembers, “We all went down to the president’s office, you know. 
	There was one girl there who could speak really well, and she had one of 
	those bullhorns. She yelled up at the windows, ‘this is a castle, and there 
	sits the king!!’” Sandi smiled at the recollection of this event and seemed 
	to remember it as exciting and without regret. Asked if a goal was 
	accomplished, she said she didn’t know exactly what it was about at the 
	time, but felt she should show solidarity with her fellow workers anyway.

	Although Sandi is sympathetic to the poor situation of many hourly workers, 
	she sees their large numbers as weakening the union staff.&nbsp; She states, “We 
	rely on other unions (at UW) to support us…It’s not a solid union.” She 
	realizes that hourly workers do not have the job security that she has, but 
	feels that if the union could figure out a way to incorporate their numbers, 
	it would make Local 1488 more powerful. </p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandi gets along fairly well with her supervisors, and says the 
	manager, who has been there for seven years, has mellowed out. She says she 
	has no problem going to him if she has a complaint. Sandi’s attitude is one 
	of compromise.&nbsp; She says, “They have a responsibility and so do we.” She 
	sees it as both the employer and the employee’s job to show each other 
	respect and compromise.</p>

	&nbsp;She says, “I think the relationship should be happier (between employees

	“What do you want?!” &quot;Alfred&quot; bllows at me without looking up from the pan 
	where he is swiftly breading chicken breasts. Five more pans, already 
	filled, are lined up on the counter in the kitchen. Alfred is “Cook One” and 
	he cooks dinner every night at an HFS facility, beginning at 11am and ending 
	about 7:30pm. When he comes in at 11:00, he goes about his routine (“I only 
	have a routine for the first hour and half”), filling pasta bins, getting 
	the many utensils he will need for the next eight hours, yelling at the dish 
	room staff if the utensils are not clean, and pulling out the food he will 
	begin to prep. Periodically he takes long strides around the breadth of the 
	kitchen, his 6' 4&quot; frame slightly hunched over at the waist, long legs 
	carrying him swiftly around as he barks orders and calls out workers names. 
	He is in charge of supervising the majority of the hourly staff, which 
	includes all the kitchen workers and many of the frontline food servers and 
	back room food “preppers.” He gave me the impression that he’s had quite a 
	few conflicts with people he supervises, but says he has “Learned to allow 
	for peoples’ challenges.” Alfred also feels that he is hurt by the number of 
	hourly staff working at HFS, complaining that most of them don’t stay long 
	enough for him to teach them enough to be useful in the kitchen. He says 
	hiring a more stable prep staff is the number one thing he would like to 
	change about his job. </p>

	Alfred describes himself as “A fifth generation cook…my family’s been here 
	since the Constitution.” He says he’s been cooking for more than 25 years, 
	over half his life, although he’s worked in a wide variety of venues, 
	including daycares and other universities across the country. He has also 
	worked on fishing boats in Alaska, on a yacht in San Francisco, and owned a 
	catering company. In the early 90’s, he owned a jazz club in Portland but 
	said “I don’t like Jazz…I just saw it as a chance to play with food.” That 
	ability to play with food is Alfred’s favorite pastime, as well as his job. 
	He’s been at HFS for almost two years, and enjoys the amount of autonomy he 
	has, but sees plenty of room for improvement. “They set the menu…but let’s 
	just say I use my own judgment on some things,” he says.&nbsp; He appreciates the 
	benefits of being one of the few classified staff at HFS, such as his health 
	insurance and relatively high wages. He points out, “There’s an A-K scale. 
	Most people get hired in at ‘A’ but I was hired at ‘K.’” Because he was 
	hired at the top of his pay scale, Alfred receives only cost-of-living 
	raises. </p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dislikes what he calls the “bureaucracy” of HFS, saying, “I 
	wasn’t schooled in it,” and would like a freer hand to determine what kind 
	of food to make and how much. He says that middle management, which sets the 
	menu, all too often has an attitude of, “It’s our way or the highway,” 
	Alfred says, “I would like it to be more flexible.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	Alfred, like Kayo, is not a strong supporter of unions, although unlike many 
	of the other staff members, he has belonged to one in nearly all of his 
	previous jobs. “The Northwest is a union region…if you live here, you gotta 
	be in one,&quot; he says. When he worked on fishing boats, he belonged to a 
	Maritime union, and at the Kingdome he belonged to Local 8, which he didn’t 
	like. Alfred says his union rep is very accessible, although he couldn’t 
	remember his name, and hollered across the kitchen to another worker, “Hey 
	what’s the union guy? What’s his name?”&nbsp; After a few minutes it was 
	determined that his name is Joe, although Alfred said he never knew his last 
	name and doesn’t have much to do with him.&nbsp; </p>

	The extent of Alfred’s participation in the union is paying his dues, and he 
	says he wouldn’t support a union strike and didn’t join the one-day strike 
	last year. His attitude is that striking is against his personal integrity. 
	“If I take a job, I keep it, I come to work,&quot; he asserts.&nbsp; Alfred said that 
	in the event of a strike, he would have no problem crossing a picket line, 
	and in fact has done so before. People tried to give him a hard time, he 
	says he “Didn’t stand for it,” and the picketers backed off. </p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn’t resent the money he pays to the union, although he 
	doesn’t know what it’s used for and feels that the union is too slow to 
	handle grievances. In his two years at HFS, he’s had a number of grievances, 
	mostly with management, but says he found it’s better to “Handle it myself.” 
	He feels the union should work on getting him better medical and dental 
	benefits, and should have a better and more defined merit system. Alfred 
	feels that his wages should not stop at “K” but should be dependent at least 
	partly on experience and customer satisfaction. </p>

	Alfred’s attitude that merit should count for more was echoed by Yunis, a 
	Turkish worker who has worked for HFS for three and half years. Previously 
	he worked at the Subway at the Hub, and at another residence hall. Yunis is 
	an hourly worker who currently works 25 hours a week, about five hours a 
	day, during dinner. His job for the past year has been a made-to-order bar 
	concept that Yunis proposed to management himself. The work is labor 
	intensive, hot and sweaty. As I interview him, I notice several blisters on 
	his hands, and ask if those are souvenirs of HFS, “Of course,” he grins. </p>

	Like Kayo, Yunis is from Turkey. However, Yunis is not a student, and says 
	he “Doesn’t like school.” When he first came to Seattle, he went to North 
	Seattle Community College for two years before dropping out. Recently, Yunis 
	married a student worker at HFS, and they plan to have a formal wedding this 
	summer. His wife will graduate from the University of Washington at the end 
	of next year, but until then Yunis says, “My priority is to make as much 
	money as I can so I can support her.” </p>

	Yunis’s added responsibilities prompted him to apply for classified status 
	six months ago. He says HFS sent an advertisement around saying what they 
	were looking for, and his manager told him he should think about applying. 
	“So I put together my resume and sent it downstairs (to Human Resources),” 
	he says.&nbsp; His resume was one of three or four chosen by HR to send around 
	campus to managers who might be interested in hiring. However, no one on 
	campus had an opening for a classified employee. </p>

	“One of the most difficult things about the system is that when you find 
	someone great you don’t have the opportunity to hire them,” says Rebecca, a 
	manager/chef at another HFS facility. Because she is part of the 
	professional staff, she does not belong to the union either. Like Yunis, she 
	can be fired without cause. To her though, this is neither strange nor 
	unfair. </p>

	She says, “I worked in the private sector before this…a lot of restaurants. 
	In the private sector, if you don’t perform, they kick you out! That was 
	something I had to get used to here, that they (the classified staff) 
	couldn't just be fired. You have to jump through about 15 hoops with the 
	union first.”&nbsp; Because it is so hard to fire classifieds, Rebecca says there 
	is enormous pressure on management to hire someone who is right for the job

	Rebecca says she has, “Been on both sides of the union.” She worked for a 
	private company for about five years doing phone sales and says, “I hated my 
	job but I managed to work there for 5 years. I had a 20% absenteeism 
	rate…that means that every fifth day I was calling in sick.” She was never 
	fired because and says “They had to issue warnings first, and as soon as 
	they gave me a warning…I would find another way to keep myself amused.” She 
	laughs, “I’ve matured a bit since then.” She feels that unions often exist 
	only to protect lazy workers. Without the union, she says, “You either 
	perform or you leave.” </p>

	Yunis has decided to quit HFS by the end of spring quarter. This decision is 
	partly because he was unable to reach classified status and partly because 
	his time as an hourly worker has “run out.” By the time he quits, he will 
	have only 77 more hours that he is able to work before he reaches a limit of 
	850 per year. He has been told that the University has had to “freeze the 
	hiring” because first the Hub and then McMahon dining hall were closed, and 
	there was an abundance of classified workers. “I don’t know, I don’t even 
	care anymore,&quot; he says.&nbsp; His bitterness was evident when I asked if I could 
	use his real name for this project.&nbsp; “Of course! It’s the truth, why should 
	I be ashamed to use my name?” When I insinuated that perhaps using his name 
	would have repercussions for other staff who wished to remain protected, 
	since they would not be “quitting,” Yunis exploded, “I am not quitting 
	either! I’m losing my job! Is there some kind of difference?”</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Previously, the Washington State statute was vague on what constituted a 
	temporary employee. Now, under the 1050 rule, employers must either fire 
	workers or make the decision to hire them. Although the law was passed to 
	prevent hourly worker abuse, according to Rebecca it merely creates another 
	way for employers to exploit them. At HFS, she says, management actually 
	stops employees (fires them) at 850 hours, to make sure that they do not 
	accidentally cross the line over into classified staff, something that can 
	happen if an hourly worker is employed for more than 1050 hours in one year. 
	When a manager lets that happens, she says, he’s the one who gets fired. 
	Instead, most hourly workers at HFS work full time just like regular 
	employees, and use up their allowed hours in approximately five months. 
	After that they’re told to leave, but with a verbal understanding that they 
	can come back at the start of the next year, when they get a whole new set 
	of hours. In this way she says, “Some people have worked here for more than 
	eight years…” </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Yunis has no intention of become one of these workers. He has been told that 
	if he comes back in September he can have his hourly job again, but he 
	scorns the idea of working for HFS without classified status. Yunis sees the 
	minimum on hours and the union protection given to classified workers as 
	combining to thoroughly exploit the hourly worker. “It works for them—the 
	people with the money. Classified are set. Students don’t care. It’s the 
	hourly workers who get screwed,&quot; he says.</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	He sees classified staff, like Sandi and Erika, as workers who are so 
	securely protected by the union that they become lazy and ineffectual at 
	their jobs. When talking to him, his barely controlled frustration is 
	evident, as he struggles to find the words. “I’m not trying to sound like 
	I’m cocky…but I could do the work of these people and more…I’m a good worker 
	and I could do this better,” he asserts. Although hourly workers are made 
	aware of their precarious status when they are hired, Yunis says workers 
	still feel robbed and dismayed when they are suddenly let go, “When you sign 
	the paper, you feel like, ‘great!’ you found a job—then they fire you.” </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Yunis’s feelings about the union are mixed. On the one hand he supports it 
	by saying, “I don’t look at unions bad, I never have. Unions protect the 
	employee from the manager, that’s the way I see it.” When he lived in 
	Turkey, he worked at a Burger King and belonged to a union. “I paid my 
	money, but I never need to have business (with the union.)” On the other 
	hand, Yunis shares Rebecca’s view that unions protect lazy workers, 
	particularly those he sees as “hogging” the few, and precious classified 
	jobs at HFS.</p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	&nbsp;“If you’re a good worker, you don’t need a union, because the boss won’t 
	get you. I’m a good worker, so the union is good for me because it protects 
	me…but I could get another job.&nbsp; If you’re lazy the union protects your job. 
	People who say ‘I couldn’t find a job’ are lazy. They’re the ones who need 
	help,” he says.&nbsp; Rebecca also sees burnout and laziness among classified 
	workers, saying, “How do you manage someone who’s been here for 20 years?” 
	The rate of turnover among management is much higher than that of 
	classified, in part because professionals are not unionized. “They see us 
	come and go…it’s very difficult,” she says. Her dismal view of the union 
	seems to be confirmed by an experience a good friend and former colleague at 
	the company she once worked for. Her friend was a union member when the 
	company went on strike last year. Rebecca’s friend supported the strike and 
	stayed away from work. However, by the time she came back to work, the union 
	effectively was broken, and less than 50 employees were active union 
	members. Those that were union members, like Rebecca’s friend, had been 
	reassigned and put in an environment with a new team of workers and new 
	supervisors. Her friend was also given extraordinary sales expectations to 
	“keep her on her toes” and insure that she never fulfilled her job. Once the 
	union was gone, Rebecca says, the environment was so oppressive that her 
	friend ended up leaving after being lectured for not acknowledging a former 
	scab in the hallway. Paradoxically, Rebecca seems to hold the union 
	responsible for this, perhaps for perpetuating an unsuccessful strike. </p>

	A common thread running through the words of the food workers, whether 
	classified, professional or hourly, was their overall ambivalence about the 
	effectiveness of unions as a tool to improve the livelihood of workers. All 
	of the people I interviewed, whether they came down in the end as pro- or 
	anti-union, shared mixed feelings and confusions about the purpose and duty 
	of a union in a workplace dominated by non-classified staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	Another disturbing element I found was that all of the classified workers I 
	spoke to had been hired from “outside,” none had worked their way up from an 
	hourly status, with the exception of Sandi, who started working for the 
	University before there was a union. As Linda Ray Pratt describes, the 
	situation is similar for part-time faculty, “The jobs hardly ever convert to 
	regular tenure-track lines.”<a title name="_ednref8" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
	So the plight of temporary workers seems to be not much alleviated by the 
	1050 rule despite the fact that in the lawsuits that prompted the rule, the 
	defendant employers were encouraged to hire part-time employees as full 
	after they had completed a certain amount of hours. As Yunis’ situation 
	shows, it is very difficult to “work up” no matter how skilled or talented 
	you are. “(Workers) are demoralized when performance goes largely unnoticed 
	or faithful service over time does not merit stability of appointment...”<a title name="_ednref9" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a></p>

	Linda Ray Pratt alludes to the huge profit gained by the institution by not 
	having to pay benefits to temporary workers. “First, the profit to the 
	institution is outrageously advantageous.”<a title name="_ednref10" style="color: #333399; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> 
	Rebecca, the middle-management professional, echoed this sentiment that the 
	hourly situation among food service workers is economically driven by 
	saying, “Sometimes benefits are 25% of the hourly wage on top of them... so 
	if someone earns 10 dollars an hour, they really have to pay them $12.50…and 
	they just can’t afford it.” </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	As a deliberate management strategy the exploitation of temporary workers is 
	seemingly seen as unfortunate but necessary, in times when higher education 
	receives less and less support at the state level. However, an attitude that 
	seems to imply, “We don’t have the money to offer a living wage” to any but 
	classified employees belies the real truth of simple prioritizing that is at 
	the heart of hourly exploitation. </p>
	<p style="line-height: 150%; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
	In her essay, Pratt refers to a number of tenured faculty who are gradually 
	becoming aware and concerned about the large numbers of part-timers on 
	campus and says, “Growing numbers of them are troubled because the link 
	between increased use of part-time faculty and administrative redesign of 
	faculty roles is more apparent now that post-tenure review is an open 
	strategy.” It is highly probable that as Pratt implies, tenured faculty may 
	sit up and take notice of the plight of part-time staff only when their own 
	security is threatened by the same winds of academic restructuring. However, 
	it is important that they and the rest of the campus community, including 
	undergraduate students, begin to cultivate an awareness of this situation 
	now. As members of the university who are literally served by the 
	exploitation of food workers, students should be troubled by what is deemed 
	a necessary allocation of funds that results in only a select “elite” of 
	workers who are organized into unions. The benefits of job security, 
	retirement accruement and a livable wage should be the standard on all 
	college campuses, both for those in the academic and laboring “class.” </p>

	Furthermore, there is a direct link between undergraduate students and 
	future academic jobs, while an even more immediate link exists in the form 
	of the many of us who now hold and will continue to rely on entry-level, low 
	wage food service jobs in order to pay for that academic training. </p>
