			The University of Washington Building and Construction Trades 
			Council represents a miniscule part of a rich and storied history in 
			building trades unionization. For nearly two hundred years, skilled 
			workers have been organizing with various amounts of success in the 
			United States. To a spectator it is a lot like watching an ocean as 
			the years pass—ebbs of highs and lows. The U.W. union is actually 
			the last trades-only union on a university campus in Washington 
			State. The carpenters, electricians, plumbers, painters, and other 
			skilled workers at other state campuses, like Washington State 
			University, are members of one all encompassing union. General 
			unions consist of secretaries, librarians, carpenters, food staff, 
			janitors, etc.—all union staff on campus bargain together. The 
			different employees have to work together as an unified whole. At 
			the University of Washington the skilled workers are a bargaining 
			unit unto themselves and are able to focus specifically on their own 
			issues. Resembling its larger history, the U.W skilled workers have 
			fought both internally and externally, but all the while have kept 
			together in hopes of improving their work and lives. </p>

			<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">The men and women 
			of the University of Washington Building and Construction Trades 
			Council are a highly skilled group of employees vital to the 
			maintenance and improvement of the university. The union is broken 
			up into sixteen specialized classifications ranging from carpenters, 
			painters, and electricians, all the way to such initially puzzling 
			titles like control technician, facilities operation specialist, and 
			refrigeration mechanic with another ten sandwiched in-between. As of 
			May 30, 2002 the union had 326 member at the University of 
			Washington. Ninety-five percent of the workforce is male, which is 
			not an enormous surprise considering the type of work, but is 
			something the union says it would like to improve. Seventy percent 
			of the skilled workers are white. The remainder are African 
			Americans, Asian, Native Americans, and Latinos.<a title name="_ednref1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[i]</span></span></a> 
			During the nineties the union had made a concerted effort to 
			diversify its ranks—partly out of fairness—and partly to ensure the 
			union’s longevity. Only by increasing the ever-growing number of 
			minority employees can the union compete with the non-union sector. 
			Though the skilled workers at the University of Washington can 
			expect to make about thirty percent less then private sector workers 
			they still do quite well. A carpenter and painter can expect to make 
			about $41,000 a year—a facilities operation specialist makes in the 
			neighborhood of $49,000—a refrigeration mechanic $46,900.<a title name="_ednref2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[ii]</span></span></a> 
			Workers at the University admit they could make more money in the 
			private sector, but say they trade the fiscal perks for job 
			security. If the construction economy in the Puget Sound hits hard 
			times, they won’t have to leave town to find work. While other 
			workers travel around the country looking for a job, U.W. employees 
			can stay put with their families.</span></p>

			<span style="line-height: 150%; font-size: 12pt">The carpenters, 
			electricians, and painters at the University of Washington can be 
			seen where one might expect, repairing a building, risking a shock 
			at an outlet, or covering up an anti-frat doodle in a restroom 
			stall. Most of the workers are highly trained specialists. The 
			painters seen walking around campus would be considered chemists by 
			some, having to know what the combinations of a multitude of paints 
			and chemicals will or will not do. At least that is what a painter I 
			talked with would have one believe. His expertise benefits everyone. 
			Nothing could be worse then a bathroom full of students 
			simultaneously passing out from an invisible toxic cloud. Our health 
			is literally in their hands. Control technicians take care of the 
			instruments controlling the building environments around the campus. 
			If one ever sees someone working on a thermostat in a classroom, he 
			or she is looking at a control technician, or an extremely bored 
			student. A facilities operations specialist is supposed to keep the 
			school in one piece when the campus sleeps. A refrigeration 
			specialist keeps all the freezers operating, including the ones 
			holding various fluids at the hospital. Each of the sixteen 
			classifications is trained at least as rigorously as a painter, but 
			according to their job specification. The preparation is 
			accomplished through a five-year program of intense on and off the 
			job apprenticeship training.&nbsp; These men and women may avoid the 
			notice of self-interested students, but they indelibly impact our 
			campus experience.<br>

			Current members of the University of Washington Building and 
			Construction Trades Council are part of a relatively lengthy and 
			extremely complicated history. From the early 1800’s, skilled 
			trades’ workers throughout the United States were organizing 
			themselves into unions—each with its own interesting story. 
			Historian Michael Kazin writes about the early history of the 
			skilled trades in San Francisco. The San Francisco Building and 
			Trades Council, run by P.H. McCarthy in the late 1880’s through the 
			early 1900’s, serves as a good representation of where the skilled 
			workers at the University of Washington came from. People in the 
			early twentieth century were witnesses to the Building Trades at the 
			height of their power. McCarthy wanted to secure higher wages, 
			better benefits, a shorter workday, and a safer workplace to all 
			members of the trades, using a variety of methods to obtain these 
			goals. Keeping a closed shop—employers only used union employees—was 
			one method. If a man was not a union member he would only have a 
			certain amount of time to join the union, or else lose his job. One 
			way to ensure employers adhered to the BTC’s demands was to withhold 
			skilled labor from troublesome employers’ jobs, stopping the work.

			Most of the time the threat of a strike was enough to keep employers 
			from using non-union workers. If an employer insisted on using 
			non-union labor, as was the case during the 1908 building of the 
			First National Bank in San Francisco, the union would call to arms. 
			The contractors hired some non-union workers to finish the bank’s 
			ceiling. When the Building Trades heard about this they had the 
			other skilled workers walk off the job in solidarity. Only if the 
			contractor hired union workers to finish the ceiling would the 
			carpenters, electricians, and others come back to finish the job. 
			The threat of having no skilled workers convinced the contractor to 
			give in to the union’s terms. By withholding labor from the market, 
			the union had asserted its authority for the security of its 
			members. Either union labor would be used, or the job would be held 
			up indefinitely. </p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			Another instrument McCarthy, and other skilled trade groups, used to 
			accomplish their aims was the employment of apprenticeship programs. 
			They wanted absolute control over training and hiring. Strict 
			apprenticeship would guarantee long term security and strength, 
			allowing the union to pick who was going to join and how many. A 
			union, through the apprenticeship programs it uses, can basically 
			monopolize a trade’s workforce. They are able to ensure the quality 
			of the work being produced and the people who are capable of 
			performing it. If McCarthy’s vision completely held, the skilled 
			trades would have immense power in determining what they would do 
			and how they would be compensated for it. Lacking access to the 
			different trades’ knowledge and constantly being under the threat of 
			not getting a job done, from lack of skilled workers, would have put 
			employers in a very weak position. <br>

			Throughout the twentieth century, skilled workers at the University 
			of Washington have been organized in various forms. Originally, the 
			separate trades bargained apart from one another as they did in the 
			private sector. The carpenter local would negotiate for the 
			carpenters on campus and only the carpenters. It was this way for 
			all the trades. Each member’s dues went to their corresponding 
			local, not to an unified local of all the skilled workers on campus. 
			Worker separation created problems in obtaining goals for the U.W. 
			workers. Union representatives were overlooking the interests of 
			campus workers because each local saw issues in the private sector 
			as taking priority over the public. Most of the members were in the 
			private sector so U.W. workers were often paying their dues and 
			receiving little representation. Another problem was disunity. The 
			workers on campus were unable to effectively organize to have common 
			problems they all faced addressed—every unit was isolated. Due to 
			the local union's priorities, and a divided workforce, the benefits 
			and the voice union membership gives was for the most part missing 
			for the U.W. tradesmen.</p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			In 1974 trade groups agreed to reorganize. Instead of each trade on 
			campus being represented by its own local, all of the trades came 
			together as a unified bargaining unit, directly affiliated with the 
			Seattle King County Building and Construction Trades Council. Campus 
			workers now had their own representative to address their demands. 
			Instead of a bunch of business agents running all over campus for 
			the different groups of workers there was one, that dealt 
			specifically with University workers unique situation.</p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			The reconstruction came with a price. The group of men and women 
			skilled workers at the University of Washington was now in a union 
			quite a bit different than what they were accustomed to. Problems 
			that arise between people in any newly formed unit were 
			there—republican versus democrat, man versus woman, individual 
			versus individual, and trade versus trade. The disagreements were no 
			longer simply between a group of carpenters or pipe fitters isolated 
			from each other. It was like sticking a bunch of people together who 
			spoke a different language and asked them write a book. Each trade 
			was used to dealing with things their own way. The need to now act 
			in one determined way was bound to cause growing pains. After a 
			time, each trade was able to put its own idiosyncrasies aside, but 
			the initial problems were just a sign of a tiring, but hopeful, 
			future.<br>

			From the mid-seventies to the present day, the union of skilled 
			trades workers at the University of Washington constantly suffered 
			from internal discomfort, but through all the difficult moments they 
			were able to stay together to secure prosperity and autonomy. From 
			1974, when the U.W skilled trades organized into their current 
			formation, until the late eighties, life in the union was 
			comparatively quiet, but one problem came about that could not be 
			easily ignored. They were not allowed to collective bargain in the 
			typical fashion. The main dilemma came from being represented in the 
			public sector. Unions that represent public employees in Washington 
			are unable to bargain for a number of typical items, most 
			importantly, wages. Salaries are determined by the state legislature 
			and are non-negotiable, which frustrates many members of the U.W 
			skilled trades. They wonder what they are paying their $40 a month 
			for. The union does offer job protection and legal assistance, but 
			cannot do much for what people really care about—the pocket book. 
			Most of the internal problems of the union came, and still come, 
			from the unhappiness with the restrictions of the union negotiating 
			power. <i>What good is the union if it cannot get me more money?</i></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			In the late eighties the internal unhappiness over union 
			representation really began to boil over with the help of the United 
			States legal system. Two United States Supreme Court decisions were 
			key in beginning the more aggressive discontent. The 1986 Chicago 
			Teachers Union v. Hudson decision found that unions were required to 
			provide members with information supporting the union’s financial 
			breakdown of forced dues; that those figures be verified by 
			independent audit; and that employees have an opportunity for a 
			prompt, impartial review of the union’s forced-dues calculations. In 
			1988 the Communications Workers of America v. Beck affirmed the 
			right of union members to withhold forced union dues for all 
			activities unrelated to collective bargaining. These two decisions 
			required unions to conduct what are known as Beck-Hudson audits, 
			which the union must conform with or else due payment becomes 
			optional. The auditor determines how much of the dues are 
			chargeable. Once the numbers are reached, members not wanting to 
			support the union’s non collective bargaining activities can have 
			the percentage of non-chargeable money refunded.<a title name="_ednref4" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt">[iv]</span></span></a>
			</p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			Optional dues payment severely hurts the power of the union. For 
			one, the union’s money supply is severely depleted. Also, non-paying 
			members receive the same benefits of paying members, which creates 
			intense resentment between employees. Those that pay dues feel like 
			the people not paying are unfairly taking advantage of union 
			benefits. <i>They are not paying dues. Why should they benefit?</i></p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			Initially, the University of Washington Building and Construction 
			Trades Council was not in compliance with the Beck-Hudson audit. 
			Mandatory dues collections were suspended. The potential shortfall 
			of money for the union could have been its end, but after a couple 
			years the union straightened out its accounting system and passed 
			the audit. For the last two years the independent auditor found that 
			ninety-five percent of the dues collected were chargeable, basically 
			the maximum. Once in agreement with Beck-Hudson, dues payment became 
			mandatory again, with members only being able to withhold the 
			non-chargeable money—the union had survived the audit challenge. But 
			the newfound power dissenting members found during this time 
			manifested itself in a number of other detrimental ways for the 
			union.</p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			Supreme Court decisions allowed any member of a union to call into 
			question the results of any audit. Once objected to, the matter goes 
			to an arbitration hearing. Substantial legal costs are accumulated 
			during these proceedings. No one member usually has the financial 
			means to go through with calling audits into question. It is too 
			expensive, but there are pro-business organizations like the 
			National Right To Work Committee, based in Virginia, who will offer 
			legal support anti-union membership. These associations and members 
			see arbitration hearings as a way to break up a union, driving it 
			bankrupt. Some of the people at the University of Washington are not 
			happy with the union’s current form because it cannot deal with 
			issues they see as most important—wages and benefits. They resented 
			the cost of dues and challenged it through arbitration. A small 
			union cannot afford to deal year after year with the process of 
			arbitration—it would drain all its money away. The U.W. Skilled 
			Trades Council had to face arbitration hearings on three separate 
			occasions in the late nineties. Each time the arbitrator ruled in 
			the union’s favor. At the third case’s conclusion, the arbitrator 
			decided he would allow no more cases against the U.W. Skilled Trades 
			unless they stood on more well-founded ground, seeing the attempts 
			as a waste of everyone’s time. Even though the audit line of attack 
			did not work, it did serve to spur on dissenters to look for other 
			means to get out of a union system they were not happy with.</p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			Another method for anti-union people in the U.W. Skilled Trades to 
			dissolve the union came in the form of two different types of 
			elections. The first was a union shop election. Four such elections 
			have taken place between 1990 and 2002. These elections are held to 
			decide whether or not dues payment should be optional or mandatory. 
			All four of the elections have ended with dues payment remaining 
			mandatory, but if one were to succeed the union would basically 
			cease to be. Some people would not be paying their fair share for 
			representation—creating animosity and drying up vital funds—a 
			situation most unions cannot survive. </p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			The second means used to put an end to the union was a 
			decertification election, which would immediately end union 
			representation if successful. If this happened, the skilled trade's 
			workers would not be allowed union representation for a year, and at 
			that periods end the prospects of reorganizing would be an uphill 
			battle. To get a decertification election started, thirty percent of 
			the union’s members must sign statements. So far, all 
			decertification votes have been defeated, but there will be another 
			one in May, 2002. </p>
			<p style="line-height: 150%; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent">
			Given the frantic nature of the University of Washington Building 
			and Construction Trades Council over the last fifteen years, one 
			might conclude the union is headed towards its demise, but positive 
			signs do exist. Assuming the May decertification vote fails, a more 
			stable future could be around the corner. Though there have been 
			numerous attempts to dismantle the union in its current state, the 
			sentiment for unionization runs extremely deep throughout the rank 
			and file. During the TA’s June 2001 strike ninety-nine percent of 
			the University of Washington skilled workers refused the cross the 
			picket line in a show of solidarity. Even with all the internal 
			strife, deep down most of the skilled workers do value unions. Most 
			of the problem revolves around the small spectrum of items they can 
			negotiate for. If more were on the bargaining table skilled workers 
			internal strife would drastically decrease. </p>

			Early in 2002 the Washington State Legislature passed a law granting 
			unionized public workers collective bargaining rights like those 
			prized in the public sector. When it takes effect, what was once off 
			the table in negotiations will be fair game. Unions will be able to 
			negotiate over work rules, pay scales, and benefits. If the 
			decertification vote in May fails, the future for the University of 
			Washington Building and Construction Trades Council could be as 
			bright as it ever has been.</p>

			The Skilled workers at the University of Washington undeniably 
			resemble aspects their past. The skilled trades union requires 
			employees to become members within sixty days of being hired. If 
			they don’t, they are let go. They will withhold labor just like 
			their brethren of the past. During the TA strike of the 2001 summer 
			the trade’s workers respected the picket line in a show of 
			solidarity—willing to sacrifice their own pay in the hopes of 
			strengthening the union cause. Apprenticeship programs are also 
			employed. As in the past, they use these to ensure quality work and 
			union loyalty. The Building Trades past and present actions benefit 
			their unionized workers of today—still representing a powerful force 
			on the job and in the state legislature. </p>

			Despite all of the apparent problems the University of Washington 
			Building and Construction Trades Council does accomplish a good deal 
			for its members. Members might not make as much as private sector 
			employees, but they are by no means starving. Your average carpenter 
			or painter at the University makes around $41,000 a year. While 
			their private sector journeymen counterparts earn in the 
			neighborhood of $58,136 and $52,000 respectively—with equivalent 
			benefits. These private sector figures have been reached using each 
			trade’s prevailing wage and assuming full time work throughout the 
			year. The higher wages, better benefits, eight-hour workdays, safer 
			workplace, and job security P.H. McCarthy sought at the dawn of the 
			twentieth century are all staples university workers presently 
			enjoy.</p>
