<P><font size="2">Abstract</font></B><font size="2">: The<I><B> Socialist World</B></I> </B> was the official organ 
of the Socialist Party of King County, Washington. It was one of two papers born 
as a result of the ideological split and demise of it’s progenitor, The Herald. 
<I>The Socialist World</I> (SW) sallied forth on Friday, July 14, 1916. The 
other half of that split, <I>The Commonwealth</I>, first appeared two weeks 
later. The <I>SW</I> was produced by a committee of The Socialist Party of King 
County. The ideology throughout the less than one year life of the paper can be 
summed up simply as: Eugene Debs good, Samuel Gompers and craft unionism very 
bad; Karl Marx good, capitalism very bad. Extreme loyalty to the Socialist Party 
doctrine very good, party "treason" very bad. Articles and propaganda maintained 
the Party line. Socialist Party presidential candidates for 1916, Benson and 
Kirkpatrick, and L. Katterfeld for governor, were vigorously promoted.</font></P><B>

<B><I><FONT size=2>The Socialist World</FONT></I></B>
<P><font size="2">The editorial policy of the <I>Socialist World </I>was that of the "reds" 
  rather than the "yellows." To put it briefly, "reds" were adamant about absolute 
  loyalty to the Party constitution and it’s ideological doctrine that demanded no 
  compromise with capitalists or politicians. Any Socialist Party member who even 
  <I>suggested</I> compromise was threatened with expulsion. So often did the 
  Washington state party resort to expulsion that the National Executive Committee 
  had to repeatedly intervene to manage the state party's internal disputes. The 
"reds" who ran the new newspaper and who dominated the King County Party 
  committee which determined the editorial content of the paper were essentially 
  continuing in the footsteps of Hermon Titus, who for years had fought with 
  moderates while editing <I>The Socialist</I>, a Seattle weekly and the major 
  organ of the state's Socialist movement between 1900 and 1910.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The <I>Socialist World's </I>immediate predecessor, the<I> Herald,</I> had 
  been under editorial control of the "yellows " who in early 1916 had turned the 
  paper into an organ of the newly launched Non-Partisan League (based initially 
  in North Dakota), in effect abandoning the Socialist Party. But the "reds" had 
  forced a vote of the <I>Herald's</I> stockholders, which led to its demise. In 
  the <I>Socialist World's </I>first editorial (written by a committee of three) 
  they distanced themselves from the Non-Partisan League stance of the 
  <I>Herald</I>, and committed wholeheartedly to radical socialism.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font size="2">Front Page </font> </P>
</B>
<P><font size="2">The Socialist World sallied forth as a weekly on Friday, July 14, 1916 
  featuring a full size newspaper format with up to seven columns of print, 
  graphics, and advertising on four pages. The name, <I>The Socialist World</I>, 
  remained larger than any story headlines throughout the life of the paper. In 
  smaller type beneath the name was the paper’s true purpose: "Official Organ of 
  the Socialist Party of King County, Washington." </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">ven though the newspaper was in actuality only two sides of one large page, 
  folding created the illusion of four pages. And like all full size newspapers 
  that are folded for delivery, the top half of the front page contained that 
  which the editors wished the reader to see first. For example, in the first 
  issue, on the left side, a two column width (of seven), three-level headline:</font></P>
<P><font size="2">"THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE-</font></P>
<P><font size="2">MEN’S UNION GIVES IT’S VERSION </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">OF THE WATERFRONT STRIKE." </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">The article enumerates worker demands related to a recent waterfront strike, 
  and responds to what it views as management distortions of the union position by 
  conservative newspapers such as the<I> Seattle Times</I>. It was signed, "Press 
  Committee, Riggers and Stevedores, local 50-12, Seattle, Wash." An editor’s note 
  indicates that, "despite every effort by the local", the <I>Seattle Daily 
  Times</I> had refused to print the "reply." It is basically a letter to 
  waterfront employers denying that union leadership is under the domination of 
  any powers save that of union membership; that members are not misguided because 
  the leadership is doing what the membership desires; and that their wage demands 
  were just. </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">To the right of that article, occupying three columns and dominating the 
  front page, a looming, black-robed Mr. Death beckons to the children of a 
  prostrate "working class mother," beneath a headline- size caption declaring, 
"ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR," (by Robert Minor). Without embellishment, it more or 
  less constitutes an editorial statement on it’s own.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">On the right, the remaining two column, three-tier headline, declares:</font></P>
<P><font size="2">"NAVY OFFICIALS GRIEVOUSLY</font></P>
<P><font size="2">OFFEND BIG BUSINESS THROUGH</font></P>
<P><font size="2">ALLURING CALL FOR RECRUITS."</font></P>
<P><font size="2">This attempt at satire compares the advantages of life in the Navy to 
  disadvantages of life in the mine or factory, the point being that either could 
  get you killed, but the Navy at least fed, clothed, and let you see the world in 
  the process of doing so. Much of the authorship in the paper, as for this piece, 
  is not credited. Generally, mainly national or international stories were 
  signed; straight "news" was usually not attributed. A strident tone was notably 
  favored. </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">The three columns below the graphic Mr. Death contain three different 
  articles. The first headline, " THE ‘FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY," is an indirect 
  attempt to ridicule George Washington as a drinker and gambler, apparently 
  through his own statements from one time or another. The next two articles could 
  be considered genuine news. One is headlined, &quot;LONGSHOREMENS’ HALL FIRED UPON," 
  and is much ado about bullet holes recently discovered in the union hall . The 
  other headline is: "WELLS WINS VERDICT." Stunningly, <A 
href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/jim/Desktop/labor%20press%20revisions/laborpress/Whos_Who.htm"><B>Hulet Wells</B></B></A> (notable in local 
  Socialist Party work) had somehow managed to win a $500 libel verdict against 
  the "lying" <I>Seattle Times</I>. The case stemmed from the <I>Times</I> 
  accusing Wells of embezzling $1,000 from the Socialist Party a few years before. 
  </font> 
</P>
<P><font size="2">A two column headline in the right, lower, half reads:</font></P>
<P><font size="2">"WAR DECLARED AGAINST</font></P>
<P><font size="2">MURDEROUS STEEL TRUST"</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The article announces an impending Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) 
  strike in Minnesota against the mine and steel industries and lists demands for 
  8-hour days, bi-monthly paydays, and wage increases, to name a few.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font size="2">Page Two</font></P>
</B>
<P><font size="2">The second page contained advertising and a mixture of news and propaganda. 
  Prominently featured in the upper right is a graphic of Dr. Karl Liebknecht, 
  (two/thirds the size of the front page Mr. Death illustration), whose caption 
  declares him to be "The Bravest Man in the World," (in small print), with a 
  brief statement below insisting that "we need more Liebknecht-Americans." (The 
  piece is attributed to "The Wireless.") The photo of Liebknecht serves as a link 
  to The Socialist (Seattle), which had glorified Liebknecht’s father, Wilhelm, 
  whose funeral had been front page news to the defunct Socialist.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The second, inside column on the left contained the Socialist Party masthead, 
  endorsing various Socialist Party candidates for the 1916 elections (Benson and 
  Kirkpatrick for President and Vice-president, and Katterfeld for Governor). 
  Party news was always to be found on this page. Below was "socialist news," 
  e.g., the new King County Socialist Party HQ in Seattle at the Eppler Bldg; the 
  new <I>Socialist World</I> was completely"party owned and controlled," and 
  edited by an elected press committee of seven. (The elected committee: Aaron 
  Fislerman, J. Broderman, O. Erickson, Erick Varsanen, Walker Smith, Wm. 
  Humphrey, Nicholas Schmitt.) The remainder of page two was local, national, and 
  international socialist and Socialist Party news and/or propaganda (repeated 
  essays on why socialism was so wonderful and would work just fine if only 
  everyone would only realize how right the Socialist Party really was, and after 
  all, Marx said it was supposed to be inevitable anyway)</font></P>
<B>
<P><font size="2">Page Three</font></P>
</B>
<P><font size="2">Page three contained The Young People’s Socialist League Section. Although 
  space devoted to the YPSL’s was eventually reduced after the first issue, it 
  always had at least three columns. Contents varied from love poetry to diatribes 
  against capitalism, to effusive praise of socialism and socialists. Dances were 
  favored. The wonderful inevitability of socialism if people would only listen to 
  reason was stressed. There were usually seven columns of printed matter on this 
  page, but the appearance varied considerably. The March 23, 1917 issue, included 
  a quarter page ad for a book on a topic that perpetually interests youth 
  everywhere: namely, sex.</font></P>
<B>
<P><font size="2">Page Four</font></P>
</B>
<P><font size="2">Except for the consistent placement of the legal masthead in a top-left, 
  double width column, and the two, outer, double-columns of the lower half of the 
  page devoted to double width ads (all nine of them), which remained the same, 
  columns were realigned on this page as needed for 
  reportage/announcements/propaganda, and editorials. By the time advertising 
  reached it’s peak in the Dec. 29, 1916 issue, they had some extra double-width 
  ads that overflowed into the upper half of the page. That ad "success" was 
  fleeting, however, because there was a decline in advertising from then until 
  the paper’s demise.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">Under the masthead (which reveals the paper was edited by only three members 
  of that committee of seven) an unsigned editorial separates SW from the policies 
  of it’s predecessor, The Herald, and "plants itself firmly upon the impregnable 
  rock of Marxian economics...." Eventually, on Dec. 29, 1916, SW named the 
  editor, Marius Hansome, (pro tem) and staff contributors Joe Pass, Aaron 
  Fislerman, and Mark Stone. Later, in the Mar. 16, 1917 issue, Scott Bennett was 
  editor with Pass and Fislerman as contributors. </font> </P>
<B>
<P><font size="2">Advertising and the bitter end</font></P>
</B>
<P><font size="2">Most <I>Socialist World</I> advertising was located in the two columns on 
  opposite sides of page two. They were filled top to bottom with the likes of, 
  <I>St. Paul Stove Repair &amp; Plumbing Co.; Hotel Barker Centrally Located and 
  Fireproof, rates $1 per day on up; Home Cooked Lunch; Insurance and Loans, C. I. 
  Tilton; Union Bakery Restaurant; Kazis Krauczunas, Lawyer, Speaks Lithuanian, 
  Russian, Polish, and Slavic; Nicholas Schmitt, Lawyer Advocate;</I> plus an ever 
  present ad for<I> Dancing... Hippodrome...Fifth and University.</I> It seems 
  very likely the paper did not make much, if any, money on advertising. </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">There was little variety in the ads. Most had appeared in the predecessor 
  (<I>The Herald</I>) to the last. However, less than half of the advertisers 
  with<I> The Herald</I> continued with the <I>SW</I>. Exceptionally, Frederick 
  and Nelson’s, a large department store, maintained a double width ad on page 
  four to the final issue. The column-inch, advertising peak occurred (naturally 
  enough)in the December 29, 1916 issue. We lack the issues between December 29 
  and March 16 so the decline in advertising may not have been as precipitous as 
  it appears.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">When Germany declared unrestricted submarine warfare (<I>again</I>, on Feb. 
  1917), it had a significant impact on the public attitude toward political 
  parties that were seen as rabidly anti-war, such as the Socialist Party. Even 
  before war was declared (April 6, 1917), pressure was rising against the 
  Socialist Party for many statements that were construed to be treasonous or 
  potentially so in the event of actual conflict. Socialist Party doctrine held 
  that national boundaries were irrelevant to the impending worker-controlled 
  dictatorship of the proletariat, so why should any worker fight or even 
  cooperate in hurting his fellow workers through supporting the capitalist war? 
  </font> 
</P>
<P><font size="2">On August 26, 1916, a headline, NAVY YARD SLAVERY, appeared above an 
  <I>SW</I> story appealing to workers at the Bremerton Navy shipyard to 
"confidentially supply" the newspaper with vital military information. This 
  article was the beginning of a series of four articles attacking the war effort 
  via attacks on the Bremerton Naval Shipyard operated by the US Navy. The 
  following week the ad for the Northern Bank and Trust Co. that had appeared in 
  all previous issues disappeared, not to return. By the March 23, 1917 issue, 
  several other regular advertisers had disappeared too, including the ad for what 
  was undoubtedly a popular socialist pastime: Dancing at Dreamland. </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">WWI was declared April 6, 1917. The last issue of the <I>Socialist World</I> 
  appeared three weeks before that, March 23, 1917. </font> </P>
