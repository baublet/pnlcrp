		<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Abstract:</b> The <i>Voice of Action</i> is a radical labor
        newspaper that was published weekly in Seattle from March 1933 until
        October 1936. Although the <i>Voice of Action</i> was loyal to the
        Communist Party, this was rarely ever discussed. Instead, the general
        focus was on issues of forced labor, unemployment, labor politics,
        racism, the plight of the small farmer, and the crises of the
        poverty-stricken from starvation to forced eviction from their homes.
        Each issue of the <i>Voice of Action</i> was brimming with information
        in the form of much local, some national, and a little international
        news relating mainly to the aforementioned issues. This paper served as
        a source of news that could not be found in any other publications in
        this area during this period.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <em>Voice of Action</em> </font> published mainly news articles
        about unfair wages, forced labor, unemployment issues, strikes, marches,
        boycotts, small farmer's issues, recent local, national, and
        international political happenings, racial issues, and anything
        pertaining to the capitalist exploitation of the proletariat. The
        writing bears the intensity of people passionately devoted to their
        cause. There was also a youth section, letters to the editor,
        illustrations and photographs, and politically-minded advertisements.</p>
   <p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">The first paper did not yet have a name. By the third issue the name,
        <i>Voice of Action</i>, was chosen by the board out of the hundreds of
        names sent in by the readers. Also, the paper, by the third issue, has
        three mottoes in the heading explaining what the paper stands for -- <i>Against
        the MacDonald Bill</i>, <i>Against Forced Labor</i>, and <i>For Cash
        Relief and Unemployment Insurance</i>. The paper was affiliated with the
        Communist Party, but Communism was not discussed until the 1935 and '36
        issues.</font></p>
        <u><font size="2" face="Arial">
        <p>I. From Creation to Demise</p>
        </font></u>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Voice of Action</i> began as a nameless paper on March 25,
        1933 with a strong emphasis on issues involving the unemployed. The
        State Committee of Action (SCA), which published the paper, was
        elected by delegates from 114 labor, farmer, and youth organizations
        that had participated in the hunger march to Olympia on March 1, 1933.
        The goals of this march was threefold: 1) the repeal of the MacDonald
        Bill, which made it legal to force the unemployed to work for their
        relief vouchers; 2) the distribution of emergency cash relief to the
        unemployed; and 3)the passing of the Jobless Social Insurance Bill. The
        MacDonald Bill is mentioned time and time again in the <i>Voice of
        Action</i> as being one of their main concerns for at least the first
        year of publication.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Voice of Action</i> was put out particularly for the thousands
        of members of the organizations which elected the publishers, but, as
        written in the first issue, the paper was also meant for the worker
        whose wages and job were threatened by forced labor; for the merchant
        whose profits shrink for every cut in wages or relief; for the farmer
        who cannot make ends meet at the present prices; for the student in
        search of accurate information; and &quot;for the young fellow who would
        like to organize a ball league (!) of the various unemployed
        organizations (March 25, 1933; pg. 2).&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Voice of Action</i> underwent many changes throughout its four
        years in existence. The paper gained more and more support, which made
        the paper more polished and more jam-packed with content. Throughout the
        four years of publication, issues of concern evolved from being mainly
        about unemployment to the broader scope of national and international
        news (namely the events leading up to the second world war). Also, as
        the years progressed, and as the paper became stronger, it became more
        aggressively radical and openly Communist.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The demise of the paper came with the October 9, 1936 issue. The
        board of the <i>Voice of Action</i> decided to stop publication, in
        order to contribute to the strengthening of the new progressive labor
        paper -- Commonwealth News. The Commonwealth News represented a myriad
        of liberal and labor groups that were united by the Commonwealth
        Federation. The <i>Voice of Action</i> board decided it would be best to
        have just one paper representing the progressive labor movement in the
        Northwest. The <i>Voice of Action</i> gave its mailing list to the new
        paper and encouraged the <i>Voice of Action</i> readers to fully support
        the new paper. So it goes, the <i>Voice of Action</i> did not simply die
        and vanish, but rather the <i>Voice of Action</i> sacrificed itself in
        order to fertilize a new life force -- The Commonwealth News.</font></p>
        <u><font size="2" face="Arial">
        <p>II. The Great Depression and The New Deal</p>
        </font></u>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Voice of Action</i> came into existence at the height of the
        Great Depression. Franklin Roosevelt had just taken office and
        unemployment in Seattle and elsewhere were at record levels. The
        terrible economic strife experienced by the people directly fueled the
        movement which the <i>Voice of Action</i> documented and advanced. The
        horrendous problems of unemployment, forced labor, wage cuts, and other
        economic problems all stemmed from the economic conditions of the
        Depression, and these problems were so unbearably bad that they drove
        the people to organize a social movement in response. It is the climate
        of the Great Depression which fueled the passion for revolution made
        tangible by the <i>Voice of Action</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Roosevelt's New Deal was one of the targets of The <i>Voice of Action</i>.
        The newspaper criticized the new programs for helping the rich more than
        those who were really in need. The <i>Voice of Action</i> generally took
        a tone of cynicism and loathing when discussing (or mocking) the New
        Deal policies and programs. One woodcut illustration reads,
        &quot;Another short, short story. Young unemployed fellows listen to
        rosy speeches [about New Deal jobs], go to camps, and out comes army
        ready for war (May 1, 1933).&quot; The programs to keep the unemployed
        productive were seen, in this case, as simple schemes to develop the
        unemployed into soldiers.</font></p>

        <p>III. News Highlights</p>
        </font></u>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>1933: The Truth About the March to Olympia</strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This march is what spawned the <i>Voice of Action</i>. The paper
        portrayed the Olympia Hunger March of March 1, 1933 as the most
        impressive mass movement in Seattle since the days of the General
        Strike. About 3,500 delegates from 114 working class organizations
        marched to Olympia to petition the governor for the repeal of the
        Macdonald bill, for emergency cash relief, and for the Job-less Social
        Insurance Bill. None of these demands were met by the governor, but the
        march did help to bring more attention and power to the working class
        organizers by displaying their passion and their sheer numbers.
        Throughout this year, the March to Olympia was referenced time and time
        again.</font></p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
        <p><strong>Crowd Mobilizes to Stop Blonder Family Eviction from Home</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is another issue that was dealt with in many issues of the <i>Voice
        of Action</i> throughout 1933. Many unemployed people and their families
        were being evicted from their homes by their landlords during this time.
        This particular case involved the Blonder family that resided in
        Ballard. Activists, represented by the <i>Voice of Action</i>, mobilized
        to rally around the Blonder family in an attempt to stop the eviction.
        This action stretched out over the course of many months with some
        points of perceived victory until the eventual failure in the end when
        the family was thrown out of their home.</font></p>
        <span class="style8"><font face="Arial" size="2">
        </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><strong>Organize Against the Scottsboro Boys Lynch Threat</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is another major issue covered by the <i>Voice of Action</i> for
        a period of time during 1933. This issue involved a call to action to
        rally against the unfair lynching planned by the Klan for eight black
        children in Decatur, Alabama. The eight black boys ranged in age from
        12-20. They were accused of attacking two white women, but with
        absolutely no evidence. Their case was world famous at this time as a
        test of the rights of the blacks of the South. The <i>Voice of Action</i>
        wrote, &quot;A campaign almost unparalleled in labor history has been
        waged for their freedom (April 10, 1933).&quot;</font></p>
        <span class="style9"><font face="Arial" size="2">
        </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><strong>Forced Labor at Tacoma Goodwill</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This case involved forced labor at the Goodwill's &quot;junk
        renovating outfit.&quot; Workers were forced to work for their food
        vouchers and were not paid a wage of any sort. This issue of wage-less
        labor was strongly opposed by the <i>Voice of Action</i> as a type of
        slavery that would lead to a phasing-out of wages altogether. It is
        considered, as you might guess, even more unethical since this forced
        labor practice was done by a supposedly not-for-profit charitable
        organization. Interestingly, the Salvation Army was also charged with
        forced labor a few years later.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>1934: Welcome Soviet Seamen!</strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the first time the <i>Voice of Action</i> displayed
        their Soviet sympathy and admiration. The American Communists of this
        period thought that Communism in the Soviet Union was the nearest thing
        to a utopia on the earth. They longed for America to have a similar
        revolution. The Soviet seamen that landed in Seattle were welcomed and
        revered by the <i>Voice of Action</i> which was quietly Communist.</font></p>
        <span class="style10"><font face="Arial" size="2">
        </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><strong>Russian Movie Tour Fundraiser</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet another example of the Soviet fascination displayed in 1934 is
        the <i>Voice of Action</i> Russian movie tour to raise money for the
        paper.</font></p>        <p><strong><font face="Impact"><font face="Arial" size="2">1935: Fight Move to Bar Communist Party</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wow! The <i>Voice of Action</i> is now openly supporting the
        Communist Party. They have finally &quot;come out the closet&quot;, so
        to speak. The paper is now running adverts in support of Communist
        candidates. The <i>Voice of Action</i> in 1935 becomes openly radical
        and Communist, perhaps because the paper is stronger and does not fear
        the risk associated with being Communist Party members.</font></p>

        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was a call to action to rally around the release of the wrongly
        imprisoned labor union figure -- Tom Mooney.</font></p>
        <span class="style12"><font face="Arial" size="2">
        </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><strong>Stop Fascism!</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Voice of Action</i> becomes increasingly concerned with the
        spread of fascism in Europe -- particularly Spain and Germany.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>1936: Hitler's Tyranny</strong></p>
        
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>Voice of Action</i> became very concerned and, in turn, full
        of news regarding the Hitler regime in Pre-WWII Germany. The pages of
        the <i>Voice of Action</i> are filled with news of fascism of all sorts
        all over Europe and of the particular crimes against humanity
        perpetrated by Hitler.</font></p>

        </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><strong>Boycott Hearst Publications</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In each issue throughout 1936, there was an advert from the editors
        of <i>Voice of Action</i> urging readers to boycott all Hearst
        publications which listed all of the magazines and newspapers owned by
        Hearst. The Hearst corporation was despised by the <i>Voice of Action</i>
        because of their anti-Soviet propaganda and because of their lack of
        alliance with the striking workers.</font></p>
        <span class="style15"><font face="Arial" size="2">
        </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><p><strong>The Words of Amelia Earhart</strong></p>
        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was an interview with Amelia Earhart, the great female pilot of
        this time, about her anti-war, pacifist sentiments (September 11, 1936).</font></p>

        </font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The children of the unemployed suffered greatly at this time. The <i>Voice
        of Action</i> pointed out time and time again that the dogs and cats at
        the humane societies were allotted more money for food each day than the
        government provided for children each day. This was a true tragedy at
        the time that found much attention within the pages of the <i>Voice of
        Action</i>.</font></p>
