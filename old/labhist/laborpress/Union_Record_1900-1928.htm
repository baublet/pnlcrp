      	<b>Abstract: </b>The <I>Seattle Union Record</I> is the most famous of Seattle's labor 
      newspapers. It was in circulation for 28 years, first published as a 
      weekly in 1900, then becoming a daily newspaper in 1918. Owned by the 
      Central Labor Council of Seattle, it played a key role in the 1919 General 
      Strike. Through most of its existence it was edited by Harry B. 
      Ault.</FONT></P>

pages.</font></P>

      year and it eventually increased to $1.50. By 1918, the paper was also 
      sold at 5 cents a copy at newsstands, and was being 
      home-delivered.</FONT></P>

<P><span class="style5"><font size="2">History</font><font size="2"> </font></span> </P>
<P><font size="2">On December 20, 1899, during a meeting of the Western Central Labor Union (WCLU)—which was later converted into the Central Labor Council of Seattle, the 
predecessor to the King County Labor Council—a proposal was approved to publish 
a labor paper in Seattle, which was to be called the <I>Union Record. </I>It 
began as a private venture, and the editor in charge was Gordon Rice, who had 
previously edited a paper called the <I>Labor Gazette.</I>(2) </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">The first issue came out on February 20, 1900, as a 6-page weekly newspaper. 
The headlines for that day included things like the notes from the meeting of 
the WCLU, an editorial discussing "Is Labor Too Modest?", and some words on the 
international impact of labor in "For Him Who Thinks and Feels". The ending 
statement from that first edition read, "The Union Record is the medium through 
which to reach the working people." (3) </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">By the third edition, the paper had increased to eight pages, and had worked 
out a new format. Its first pages usually reported on union activities, either 
locally or nationally, and its long-running articles provided social 
commentaries on events and issues relating to labor and social justice.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The paper was partly supported by advertising and the ads reveal about the 
readership. There were ads of various types, everything from soap, to tailoring, 
to funeral homes. This aspect made it quite obvious that the audience that this 
paper appeared to reach was a very general one, not simply a labor crowd. Indeed 
in the early years of the paper, one letter writer worried that the paper was 
being ignored by those it was intended to serve. In the August 10, 1901 issue, a 
man states that he was, "sorry it is not very well patronized by union men, as 
it deserves to be."(4)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">It is interesting to note however, that all of these advertisers appear 
either to be unionized, or sympathizers to the union. This is made clear 
following a statement and call to the masses: </font> </P>
		<P align=left style="margin-left: 0.5in">
		<FONT size=2>
		"The Union Record will not print the ad of any person or firm known by it to 
be unfair to organized labor. But an advertising contract cannot be broken at 
the pleasures of the publishers. Let this be notice to all unions to furnish 
this paper with their unfair list—NOW." (5)</FONT></P>
		<P><font size="2">The ‘unfair list’ was composed of those potential advertisers which were 
unfriendly to unions, thus it was an effective way to organize boycotts and 
punish anti-union employers.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">In its first year and a half, the newspaper called itself <I>The</I> <I>Union 
Record</I> . As of August 3, 1901, the name changed to <I>The Seattle Union 
Record</I>. There was no explanation for the change. </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">It is clear that the paper was a tool for organization, as well as a call to 
the people of Seattle, and Washington, to become aware of the goings on of the 
union and labor community. This was achieved through many mediums, with regard 
to distribution, coverage, and editorials. However, the one main thing I see 
that really appeals to the public is the rhetoric. Although rhetoric was a 
common thing for many of these newspapers, that which appears in this newspaper 
was a very understandable and easily absorbed rhetoric, with much more of a 
general appeal, not simply for an audience with fixed opinions. It is slightly 
conservative in that sense, and it differs quite distinctly from other labor or 
socialist papers of that era. </font> </P>
<P><font size="2">One point that stood out in the research information with regards to this 
newspaper was its coverage of the Seattle General Strike of 1919, one of the key 
events to befall labor in the early twentieth century, and a display of the 
rampant unionist spirit that Seattle maintained at that time. </font> </P><U>

<P><font size="2">On the dawn of February 8, 1919, the city of Seattle was still. As morning 
grew, the normal hustle and bustle of the shipyards as well as many other 
industries, had failed to commence, leaving the city shrouded in quiet and 
uncertainty. 100,000 workers had walked off the job in Seattle, a great many 
striking in solidarity with the 35,000 shipyard workers who struck in favor of a 
wage increase. 60,000 of these workers were unionized, with the possibility of 
receiving benefits while on strike, yet 40,000 non-union workers sympathized, 
even with the possibility of losing their jobs. (6) The Seattle General Strike 
had begun. It was to last four days, until February 11, during which time a 
well-organized and efficient plan played itself out. </font> </P>
		<P align=left><font size="2">The <I>Seattle Union Record </I>was instrumental in building support for the 
strike and covering it once it started. The eminent labor radical and writer for 
the paper, Anna Louise Strong—who wrote under the pen name of 
<I>Anise</I>—published an editorial regarding the strike, two days before it 
started. The following is a section of the editorial: </font> </P><B>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i><font size="2">On Thursday at 10 A.M</font></i><i><font size="2">.</font></i></P>
<P style="margin-left: 0.5in"><i><font size="2">There will be many cheering and there will be some who fear.</font></i><font size="2"> 
<i> Both these emotions are useful, but
not too much of either.
We are undertaking the most
tremendous move ever made by
<B>LABOR</B> in this country, a move which will lead--</i></font><B><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>NO ONE KNOWS WHERE!</i> 
</font> </P>

<P style="margin-left: 0.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>We do not need hysteria.
We need the iron march of labor.&nbsp; <B>LABOR WILL FEED THE PEOPLE</B>. Twelve great kitchens have been offered, and from them food will be distributed by the provision trades at low cost to all.
<B>LABOR WILL CARE FOR THE</B> <B>BABIES AND THE SICK</B>. The milk-wagon drivers and the laundry drivers are arranging plans for supplying milk to babies, invalids and hospitals, and taking care of the cleaning of linen for hospitals. <B>LABOR WILL PRESERVE ORDER</B>. The strike committee is arranging for guards, and it is expected that the stopping of the cars will keep people at home. (10)</i></font></P>
<I>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial">Anise </font> <font size="2" face="Arial">also spoke on that fact that certain people wanted to be 
disorderly, but that this was not the route to take, considering that the 
strikers were up against corporations. The only way to win the strike would be 
"the power of the strikers to manage" the strike.</font></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial" size="2">
The strikers tried to provide for the crucial needs to the city, making sure 
that children, elderly, invalids and hospital patients were well provided for 
during the strike. Firemen decided to stay on the job, as did laundry 
workers—although they only handled hospital laundry. If there were vehicles 
authorized to move, they carried signs reading, &quot;exempted by the general strike 
committee&quot;.(7) Thirty-five neighborhood milk stations were set up throughout the 
city, accessible by short distances to the families with small children. Meals 
were prepared each day by striking cooks, who helped to provide food for thirty 
thousand people. The meals were cooked in large kitchens, then transported to 
halls all over the city and served cafeteria style. All union members carrying 
union cards were honored with a twenty-five cent meal, while the general public 
paid thirty-five cents.
		</font></P><FONT face="Arial">
		<P><font size="2">The Mayor, Ole Hanson, was in an outrage. He attempted to persuade 
		the Labor council to call off the strike, and even went as far as to 
		declare the strike to be off himself. He demanded that the city-owned 
		utility company remain in service. He spent an additional $50,000 
		dollars in tax payer money to call out added police and military 
		support, all money wasted because according to the commander of the U.S. 
		army sent into the area, &quot;In forty years of military experience, he 
		hadn’t seen so quiet and orderly a city.&quot; (8)</font></P>
		<P><font size="2">The <I>Seattle Union Record</I> condemned Hanson's efforts to break 
		the strike. An article called &quot;Hanson Caused All the Trouble&quot;, quoted 
		Ben F. Nauman, chair of the Council Strike Committee, as saying that the 
		mayor prolonged the strike by inflaming tensions and issuing false 
		threats of martial law. Hanson was also accused of blatantly lying when 
		he demanded that certain services be resumed. (9)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The strike was a generally peaceful, organized protest, which unfortunately 
had to be cut off due to pressures on the striking committee from the AFL and 
various international unions, as well as the difficulties of living in a city 
that had come to a halt, business-wise. In the eyes of the nation, the strike 
was portrayed as being put down by Mayor Hanson himself, when 
he—erroneously—called in troops and deputized approximately 2,400 young men to 
‘keep order’. In actuality, the strike came to a close because of simple need.

<P><font size="2">End of an era</font></P></B></U>
<P><font size="2">The <I>Seattle Union Record </I>was eventually brought to a close after 28 
years of existence, during which time its content had matured, and its audience 
had grown. It was said to be Harry B. Ault’s &quot;personal achievement as well as 
his failure.&quot; (14) Truthfully, the newspaper was never really well off 
financially, and being owned by an organization, many of the writers came from 
the larger member unions. Unfortunately, these people often wrote poorly, which 
ended up being disastrous for the paper itself. Despite its struggle at the end, 
it had the fame of being the longest running union-owned daily newspaper, and 
the one that surpassed the general life span of many of the other papers. It 
truly made a contribution to labor news and life in the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
century. </font> </P>

		<font size="2">Mistakes have been made. The man or woman who never makes a mistake 
		never does anything. Earnest men and women prefer to play the role of a

		forward on the road that will finally lead to a world that is a better 
		place for men and women to live and work in. IT WAS ALL WORTHWHILE. (15)</font></I></p>

A commentary on the Seattle General Strike</font></P><U>
		<B>
<P><font size="2">The <I>Union Record</I>, revived</font></P></B></U>
<P><font size="2">On November 21, 2000, one thousand Pacific Northwest Newspaper guild members 
went on strike from <I>The Seattle Times</I> and the <I>Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer.</I> After a little over a month, the strikers settled 
negotiations with the <I>P-I</I>, but it took them almost three months to settle 
with <I>The Times.</I> The central issue behind the strike was the use of 
salaries and the merit-pay system. After picket lines were established, the 
Newspaper Guild began to publish a revamped, contemporary version of the 
<I>Seattle Union Record</I>, which eventually produced 18 print editions and a <B>
website.</B> It provided daily general news and highlights on the strike, as 
well as editorials and social commentaries. On the website it states that, &quot;The 
purpose of the Union Record was to highlight the work and value of the striking 
employees in hopes of hastening an end to the strike and to continue to serve 
the public with journalism the two daily newspapers could no longer provide. 
That purpose has been served….&quot; (13)</font></P>
<P><font size="2">During the strike, <I>The Times</I> and the <I>P-I</I> continued to produce 
smaller versions of their newspapers using management employees and replacement 
workers. They were delivered free to subscribers for a time, and sold at a 
quarter on the stands. </font> </P>
