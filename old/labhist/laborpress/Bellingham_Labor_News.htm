									News </i>was the official publication of the 
									Bellingham Central Labor Council.&nbsp; It<i> </i>
									was published weekly until 1968 when it 
									merged with other Northwest labor newspapers 
									to become the <i>Northwest Washington Labor

									Newspapers have long provided a window into 
									the personality of the city or town where 
									they are published and <i>The Bellingham 
									Labor News</i> is no exception. &nbsp;Although 
									the title suggests it focused exclusively on 
									the labor movement, the paper was crowned 
									the “Official City Paper of Bellingham” in 
									1940 for its coverage of national news, 
									local news, editorials, advertisements, and 
									cartoons. &nbsp;<i>The Bellingham Labor News </i>
									is thus an important source for 
									understanding<i> </i>what life was like in a 
									small but important Washington city in the 
									mid-twentieth century. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									The most distinct feature of the paper, 
									however, was its coverage of the labor 
									movement, and this fact provides individuals 
									with a unique opportunity for understanding 
									Bellingham’s labor history.&nbsp; This essay will 
									explore how the <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> 
									reported on labor and unions between the 
									years of 1939-1943. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Bellingham is located in the North Puget 
									Sound region of Washington State, about 
									ninety miles north of Seattle and twenty 
									miles south of the Canadian border.&nbsp; The 
									city was formed when small mining and 
									logging communities voted to consolidate in 
									1904.&nbsp; By 1940 the city’s population had 
									grown to over 60,000.&nbsp; </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									During 1939-1943, a large group of 
									individuals contributed to the <i>Bellingham 
									Labor News</i>. Officers serving on the 
									newspaper’s council changed frequently. For 
									example, in December of 1939 the President 
									of the paper was Phil Taylor.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									Less than a month later, however, the 
									January 12, 1940 edition of the paper 
									revealed that a new President, Ida Peterson, 
									had taken over and the vice president, 
									secretary, and treasurer had changed as 
									well&nbsp;&nbsp; William Healy, the paper’s manager, 
									was the only councilperson to retain his 
									position in the new year.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>Ida 
									Peterson held the position of President of 
									the <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> into 1943.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
									</span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									The paper’s council members were not just 
									passionately committed to the labor 
									movement, they were also highly respected 
									individuals in the Bellingham community. . 
									For example, Ida Peterson was also named 
									President of Bellingham’s Central Labor 
									Council’s Credit Union in 1940.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									That the paper’s editorial council was 
									respected both in the labor movement and in 
									the broader community suggests that they had 
									the respect of union voters as well as a 
									passion for publishing an informative labor 
									based paper that represented the vast 
									majority of working peoples’ interests.&nbsp; It 
									also suggests that Bellingham was a labor 
									city during the 1930s and 1940s. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Indeed, after reading a few issues of the <i>
									Bellingham Labor News</i> it is easy to see 
									that the labor movement had a strong 
									influence in Bellingham. &nbsp;The fact that a 
									labor newspaper was Bellingham’s primary 
									news publication speaks for itself. 
									&nbsp;Moreover, the paper reveals that unions 
									thrived in Bellingham. Nearly every job 
									imaginable in the city had a union for 
									employees. Meat cutters, shop owners, retail 
									clerks, and hospitality workers all had 
									their respective unions.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a></span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Most of Bellingham’s workers belonged to 
									unions associated with the American 
									Federation of Labor (AFL).&nbsp; The AFL promoted 
									trade unionism and mostly represented 
									skilled workers, as opposed to the other 
									prominent labor organization of this time, 
									the Congress of Industrial Organizations 
									(CIO), which promoted industrial unionism 
									and mostly represented unskilled workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Between 1939 and 1943 the <i>Bellingham 
									Labor News</i> had a strong focus on 
									consumer issues and one cannot open the 
									paper without seeing ads promoting local 
									union organizations and their products. 
									&nbsp;Goods produced by union employees were 
									constantly pushed and it seems like the 
									paper expected readers to shop exclusively 
									at union shops. One&nbsp; advertisement in a 
									1940 issue of the paper took up about 
									one-eighth of the page and read, “THESE 
									STORES ARE UNION STORES AND DESERVE YOUR 
									PATRONAGE.” Following the title came a long 
									list of retail stores that were a part of 
									the local retail clerks union: Retail Clerks 
									No. 240.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;The <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> not only 
									promoted union businesses but union products 
									as well. One ad that continually appeared in 
									the newspaper called for grocery store 
									customers to, “Ask your Grocer for These 
									Brands: Kulshan and Sonny Boy,” which were 
									likely union made grocery products.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>
									</span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									But the task of “buying union” was not very 
									difficult for consumers because, of the 
									labor movement’s strong presence in 
									Bellingham. Unions, in fact, were glue that 
									helped hold the city together. Beginning in 
									1940, the “pertinent” question identified in 
									the paper asked, “How Can We Have A Better 
									Bellingham?”<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									To help answer this question, the <i>
									Bellingham Labor News,</i> along with the 
									Bellingham Central Labor Council, arranged a 
									“Spring Gift Party.”<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;The point of this event was to have all 
									citizens of Bellingham and Whatcom County 
									attend and give their answers to the 
									question on hand. At the event, coupons to 
									union stores were distributed at the cost of 
									fifty cents each.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									In the spring of 1942, a similar event was 
									organized. This event, referred to as the 
									“1942 Spring Festival,” focused on helping 
									the United States win the war.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;Just like the “Spring Gift Party,” labor 
									unions from Bellingham planned and 
									participated in the event. The 1942 Spring 
									Festival was an extremely widespread 
									celebration. Union groups collaborated with 
									other organizations in Bellingham to make 
									the event a success.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									These events show how the Bellingham Central 
									Labor Council organized a large group of 
									individuals to promote its members’ 
									businesses.&nbsp; Additionally, they show how the
									<i>Bellingham Labor News </i>was used to 
									promote “buying union” campaigns.&nbsp; </span>
									</p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">

									These events also reveal how the Bellingham 
									public viewed unions in the mid-twentieth 
									century.&nbsp; During this time it was not 
									uncommon for people to view unions in a 
									negative light. They were notorious for 
									interrupting America’s economy with their 
									strikes and constant negotiations. &nbsp;But from 
									these examples it is apparent that the 
									people of Bellingham looked favorably on the 
									labor movement and unions were very much an 
									important part of the city in the 1930s and 
									1940s. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Because of its AFL affiliation, the <i>
									Bellingham Labor News’</i> coverage of 
									national labor news focused on AFL campaigns 
									and issues.&nbsp; One article featured a story 
									about the AFL’s fight for a six-hour workday 
									without reduction of pay. “Shorter hours are 
									held imperatively necessary to provide 
									employment for workers whose jobs are 
									destroyed through constant installation of 
									labor displacing machinery.”<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;During World War II the <i>Bellingham Labor 
									News </i>reported on the AFL’s commitment to 
									the war effort.&nbsp; For example, in 1942 the 
									paper ran a message from John P. Frey, the 
									President of the AFL’s Metal Trades 
									Department, where he argued “for all-out 
									union cooperation with the nation to win the 
									war.”<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									A large portion of the <i>Bellingham Labor 
									News</i>, then, was dedicated to 
									highlighting AFL policies and declarations 
									from its leaders.&nbsp; This demonstrates that 
									the paper was dedicated and loyal to this 
									national labor organization. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									But the <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> did not 
									ignore local events and it was, in fact, 
									extremely committed to reporting on local 
									unions. The paper frequently highlighted 
									local union events and meetings. A section 
									of the paper entitled “Council Notes” 
									contained local union news, reports on 
									meetings, membership votes, and 
									announcements.&nbsp; The May 7, 1941 edition, for 
									instance, included reports on the Teamsters, 
									electricians, painters, electricians, 
									painters, building laborers, laundry 
									workers, furniture workers, retail clerks, 
									carpenters, theater employees and barbers.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;By dedicating all this space to local 
									information the paper showed its commitment 
									to the local union movement. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									One particular problem facing many small 
									labor unions in the 1930s and 1940s involved 
									the loss of employment jurisdiction.&nbsp; 
									Employment jurisdiction referred to a 
									union’s right to represent all workers in a 
									specific job or industry in a certain 
									geographic area—without firm employment 
									jurisdiction the jobs of union laborers 
									could be taken by nonunionized workers. This 
									was especially a problem from the city’s 
									carpenters who frequently moved from job 
									site to job site; when they completed one 
									job they were often faced completion from 
									nonunionized workers at new job sites. The
									<i>Bellingham Labor News</i> saw that lax 
									employment jurisdiction regulations were 
									hurting the local workforce.&nbsp; Not 
									surprisingly, they addressed this issue in 
									great detail. On May 27th, 1942 the paper 
									reported on the plight of Carpenters’ Union, 
									Local 756 “It is the intention of the 
									Carpenters to see that there is no 
									repetition of what happened when the first 
									construction job on Ruby Dam was started. At 
									that time, although the project is located 
									in Whatcom country and well within the 
									jurisdiction of the Bellingham unions, work 
									rights were usurped almost entirely by 
									Seattle Carpenter and Construction Workers’ 
									Unions.”<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;The article also pointed out that this was 
									not an isolated incident and other unions 
									had been hurt by poor employment 
									jurisdiction enforcement. Roofers’ Local No. 
									78 of Bellingham, for instance, supposedly 
									had jurisdiction to complete roofing jobs in 
									the Bellingham area. However, “Through 
									thoughtlessness or lack of planning, 
									carpenters and allied building craftsmen 
									have been performing work on building 
									projects in this area that should rightfully 
									go to the Roofers.”<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;Clearly, the <i>Bellingham Labor News </i>
									wanted to bring these labor injustices out 
									into the public’s eye. That way, public 
									participation could prevent such actions 
									from occurring in the future. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									In addition to just reporting on local union 
									issues, the <i>Bellingham Labor News </i>set 
									aside a portion of each edition for local 
									union officers to write in and voice their 
									opinions. In a 1943 edition of the paper, a 
									representative from Retail Clerks, No. 270 
									wrote in, saying: “Cheerio, all my little 
									rabbits. We are a bit wacky from all the 
									Christmas rush, and hope you are all the 
									same. But Merry Christmas anyhow, in case we 
									can’t get anything written next week. Which 
									we probably won’t.” The article later 
									continued: “Most Salespeople who are really 
									salespeople resent being called clerks. We 
									for one do not like the name of our union. 
									We wish we had something fancy like 
									‘Culinary’ to add to it.”<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;Or, in a 1942 edition of the <i>Bellingham 
									Labor News</i> Meat Cutters’ Local 247 was 
									featured. “Well, the Meat Cutters continue 
									to function in Whatcom and Skagit counties, 
									as they have for the past quarter of a 
									century” a representative from the union 
									reported, “We do not make the headlines very 
									often, but we succeeded over this period of 
									time in gradually bettering our economic 
									condition and in keeping our place in the 
									van of progress.”<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;By giving unions like the Meat Cutters and 
									Retail Clerks a voice in its pages the <i>
									Bellingham Labor News</i> was able to 
									provide readers with news of the labor 
									movement that was not likely to make the 
									headlines.&nbsp; Thus, by highlighting local 
									union issues and allowing all types of 
									unions to submit written work, it is 
									undeniable that the <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> 
									was committed to the labor union movement in 
									Bellingham. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									During World War II the <i>Bellingham Labor
									</i>news changed its layout and began to run 
									more articles about labor’s role in the war 
									effort.&nbsp; During the years of 1942-1943, the 
									paper clearly called on organized labor to 
									support the war.&nbsp; This is not surprising 
									when one considers the AFL’s reaction to the 
									war. The AFL urged its’ members to 
									participate in bond programs and other forms 
									of home front support. But mostly, the AFL 
									called upon its members to increase 
									production to help the war effort. &nbsp;In the 
									62nd Annual AFL Convention, for example, 
									“Victory First” was the theme.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;In fact, the organization took great pride 
									in the fact that it was a crucial to 
									national defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;An August 1941 article 
									stated, for instance,” These are the 
									questions and answers that all Americans are 
									most interested in today: Who is building 
									America’s defenses? The men and women of the 
									American Federation of Labor. How are they 
									&nbsp;getting along with the job? In a way that 
									evokes the pride and merits the praise of 
									every citizen.”<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									Indeed, the AFL praised their members for 
									the hard work they put into the war effort 
									and the organization used the pages of the
									<i>Bellingham Labor Press</i> to show that 
									the AFL was willing to make major sacrifices 
									for victory. “In personal expressions, the 
									leaders emphasized their conviction that 
									‘labor as usual’ is ‘out’ for the duration.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Due to its’ geographic location and 
									proximity to natural resources, Bellingham 
									was extremely important in the American war 
									effort.&nbsp; Since it was a port town, many 
									companies considered building a shipyard in 
									Bellingham. In 1942, a man by the name of J. 
									C. Foley came to Bellingham to search for 
									shipyard sites. “According to information 
									released by Mr. Foley, the interests he 
									represented plan to seek contracts for the 
									construction of navy barges and other 
									craft.”<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									The fact that Bellingham was targeted for a 
									naval shipyard showed how the city’s 
									geographical location contributed to the war 
									effort. This was true in arenas onshore as 
									well. Bellingham was located near dense 
									forests. As a result, logging and the timber 
									industry were instrumental parts of 
									Bellingham’s economy. These industries 
									proved to be instrumental to the war effort 
									as well. During 1942, Milton H. Luce, deputy 
									regional director of the War Production 
									Board issued a statement in the paper, 
									proclaiming, “Pacific Northwest forests will 
									play an important role in providing the wood 
									to replace iron, aluminum and critical 
									metals in war production.”<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
									Indeed, during the war Bellingham industry 
									turned its’ focus to the war effort and the 
									city’s workers really did help lead America 
									to victory.&nbsp; </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									Bellingham citizens not working in the 
									shipyards, mills, or forests still helped 
									the war effort. Buying war bonds was 
									something that everyone could do. During 
									1942-1943, the <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> 
									was flooded with articles and advertisements 
									promoting readers to buy war bonds and 
									support the war effort and it ran many 
									advertisements promoting war bonds.&nbsp; These 
									advertisements were large.&nbsp; One appeared in 
									a 1943 edition of the paper. This 
									advertisement was sponsored by Puget Sound 
									Power and Light Company and took up over 
									half of a page.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;This is quite substantial when one 
									considers that the average length of the 
									paper was five or six pages.&nbsp; Readers 
									responded to these aggressive advertising 
									campaigns. Bellingham’s Meat Cutters No. 
									247, for instance, put aside a great deal of 
									their funds to purchase U.S. Defense Savings 
									Bonds.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a> 
									&nbsp;This, though, is just one example of many 
									local Bellingham unions that purchased war 
									bonds from their union budget. </span></p>
									<p class="MsoNormal">
									<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
									The <i>Bellingham Labor News</i> was written 
									and managed by a diverse group of 
									individuals from 1939 to 1943. All of these 
									individuals, however, were committed to 
									Bellingham’s labor movement.&nbsp; Clearly, the
									<i>Bellingham Labor News</i> shows that in 
									the mid-twentieth century, Bellingham was a 
									labor city.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the paper shows that 
									there was a great deal of pride  
									associated with union membership in 
									Bellingham.&nbsp; It gave small local unions a 
									voice. One cannot rule out the importance of 
									this paper to Bellingham labor and union 
									history. From it, we are able to glance 
									through windows of the past in order to gain 
									a better understanding of labor’s role in 
									Bellingham.&nbsp; </span>
