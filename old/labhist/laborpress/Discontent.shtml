<font size="2">(1898-1902)<b> </b>was
a four page Anarchist newspaper that was published weekly in LakeBay Washington
at a yearly subscription price of 50 cent. LakeBay was the postal address of the
famous &quot;Home&quot; anarchist colony that had been establish in 1896.. The
editor of the paper was Olivar A. Verity, who usually signed himself O. A.
Verity.</font></p>
<i>
<p><font size="2">Discontent</font></i><font size="2"> contains local information about Home (officially called
Mutual Home) as well as national news and articles selected from other
newspapers. It was not published by the association or solely in the interest of
the association. It was published by a group of Home residents who were
interested in making it an organ for the spreading of the principles of liberty.
Their goal was to send the truth, as they saw it, into as many homes as
possible. The tone of the paper was not militant and angry but more
straightforward and sarcastic. &quot;Viewing themselves as peaceably disposed
and kind-hearted people who were trying to elevate the conditions of humanity by
persistently and earnestly teaching the masses. How to rise to a more complete
civilization without war, starvation and unnecessary suffering of any kind.
Anarchists, who want nothing unjustly and would harm no one intentionally,
wishing everybody as well as themselves to have full liberty and equality
without fear, force or favor.&quot; (August 17, 1898)</font></p>
<i>
<p><font size="2">Discontent</font></i><font size="2"> is an abundant source of information about life in the
anarchist community. Local news is found in each issue under the caption:
Association Notes (renamed Home News after June of 1901). You can also read the

<p><font size="2">Association Notes:</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2">Here is where you will find local news regarding the anarchist settlement.
The information is this section varies from when the next singing school meeting
will be held to who’s who at the Mutual Home. Here you can also find
information about the cost of land, the number of people living at the Mutual
Home at different times throughout the life of the paper, what the weather
conditions were like, as well as the limitations of the association. The
association was simply a land-holding institution, and couldn’t take any part
in the starting of an industry. All industries were inaugurated by the members
interested and those willing to help them. The only industry that was
established during the publication of the <i>Discontent</i> was the cutting of
cordwood. &quot;Those thinking of coming here must expect to work, as it is not
an easy task to clear this land and get it in condition for cultivation.&quot;
It took about 50-100 day’s labor to clear an acre.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The December 14, 1898 edition of <i>Discontent</i> notes &quot; there were 51
colonists living at Home City and there were 15 homes. A 14x16 house made of
rough board stood up and down could be purchased for the price of $20. The
association twenty-seven and a half acres deeded and 64 acres under contract to
be deeded when paid for by incoming members, and 120 acres tax titles, but not
yet deeded.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In the May 22, 1901 &quot; there were 80 people living at Home City; 23 men,
22 women and 36 children-girls over 15 year 4, and boys 3.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">In the March 23, 1902 &quot;there were 94 colonists living at Home City; 28
men, 25 women, and 41 children-girls over 15 years 4, and boys 5.&quot;</font></p>

everyday activities this is an excellent resource.</font></p>

<a NAME="articles"><font size="2"></font></a><font size="2">Articles of Incorporation and Agreement of the Mutual
Home Association:</font></b><p><font size="2">Early issues of <i>Discontent</i> printed the Articles of Incorporation which
outlined the purpose of the association, the location of the Mutual Home, how
and who can become a member, how affairs of the association are handled, and
what happens to one’s property upon his or her death.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">*Purpose:</font></b><font size="2"> to assist its members in obtaining and building homes for
themselves and to aid in establishing better social and moral conditions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">*Location:</font></b><font size="2"> Von Geldern Cove (known locally as Joes Bay), Pierce County
State of Washington an arm of Carrs Inlet, and 13 miles west from Tacoma on an

will come to Tacoma and take the steamer ALICE for Joes Bay. The steamer leaves
Commercial dock every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8 a.m. Be sure to ask the
caption to let you off at Jose Bay.</font></p>

then issued giving him or her exclusive right to use and occupy any acre of land
he or she may choose, just as long as taxes on the tract were kept up.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">*Affairs of the Association: </font> </b><font size="2">Are conducted by a board of trustee elected
as may be provided by law.</font></p>

</b><i>
<p><font size="2">Discontent</font></i><font size="2"> is also rich with information about anarchist activities and
meetings both in the Puget Sound region as well as around the country. Items
like the following:</font></p>
<p><font size="2">&quot;Wendell Phillips Education Club meets every Saturday at 8 p.m. at 31
Robinson, Providence, RI Pamphlets in English, German, French, Jewish and
Russian languages on hand.&quot;</font></p>
<i>
<p><font size="2">Discontent</font></i><font size="2"> seems to have had a wide circulation. It claimed distribution
in two places in Boston-Columbia, and one place in San Francisco. Agents were
located in Seattle, San Francisco, and Honolulu.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Obscenity trial:</font></p>
</b><i>
<p><font size="2">Discontent</font></i><font size="2"> followed in detail the arrest and obscenity trial of Charles
C. Moore who was the editor of the Blue Grass Blade: Lexington, KY. Moore was
arrested and charged with sending obscene matters through the mail and was
convicted and sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. <i>Discontent</i> ran
notices asking for contributions for his legal aid as well as information
regarding Moore’s trial, conviction, and eventual acquittal after more than a
year in prison. <i>Discontent</i> felt that Moore’s arrest and conviction
&quot;threaten the right of every citizen, and we band together to preserve the
rights of free thought, free speech, free press, and free mails as guaranteed by
the constitution of the United States.&quot; (June 20, 1900)</font></p>
