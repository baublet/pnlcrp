          Chauffeurs and Warehousemen, and Helpers, Joint Council 28 located in
          Seattle, Washington. It circulates free to members of Joint 28 locals.
          Founded as a monthly newspaper in 1937, it became a weekly publication
          some time in 1941 and continues as a weekly today, published each
          Friday. In its early years, it did not list a publisher or editor
          other than the Joint Council 28, President Dave Beck, and Secretary
          Frank Brewster. There were few bylines with featured articles and
          editorials. During this time, the paper’s circulation was about
          25,000.<o:p>

          major purpose was to educate the IBT Joint Councils 28 locals’
          members on the ideas of labor and the activities of the Teamster’s
          locals. The newspaper was filled with labor-related news from
          national, regional , and local communities, fostering a connected
          brotherhood of solidarity, unity, pride, and family. It kept the
          members informed about their leadership’s activities. It told of the
          friends of labor, such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Warren G.
          Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson. It described the enemies of labor as
          Republicans in general, and communists and isolationists, Hitler,
          Standard Oil, and even Charles A. Lindbergh to name a few.

          Washington Teamster</b></i> also took advantage of different fonts and
          types, in upper and lower case. It displayed the official emblem of
          the Teamsters: the two side view (or split head) heads of horses
          looking in opposite directions, semi-wrapped around the top of a wheel
          of the teamster wagon with the initials for International Brotherhood
          of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America around
          on the side-wall of the tire or rim. There may or not be a headline or
          picture above the banner. The format was bold and striking.
          Journalistically, it was full of punch. It used play on words such as
          &quot;SENATOR PEPPER PEPS RALLY.&quot; There was nothing feminine
          about the paper; it was a man’s newspaper. It later tones down its
          boldness and changed its fonts and reinvented the emblem making it
          more pleasing to the all its membership.

          <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1939, war broke out in Europe
          and the U.S. began defense production for Great Britain. After the
          U.S. became involved as an ally in the war, the government went into a
          national security mode and censored information to newspaper and radio
          stations. The Teamsters ran war propaganda from &quot;How Sue Sank A
          Ship&quot; to &quot;What to do in an Air Raid.&quot; </font> <o:p>

          President of the Teamsters, to Great Britain to see how organized
          labor there was &quot;helping to win the war.&quot; Tobin returned and
          told Roosevelt, and in turn the unions (according to <b><i>The
          Washington Teamster</i></b>) that workers needed to &quot;suspend all
          labor accord&quot; in order to fight off the axis and enable
          &quot;World Freedom.&quot; Prior to 1942, the Teamsters frequently
          used strikes as an aggressive tactic to stop production and force
          management to bargain with the union. In 1942, the Teamsters, as well
          as the AFL and CIO, took the no-strike pledge (NSP). Throughout the
          war years the Teamsters avoided strike activity, maintaining the
          non-strike pledge until 1945. </font> <o:p>

          contributed resources to the allies as well. <b><i>The Washington

          (tire), metal (&quot;Heaps Build Jeeps, By Jove&quot;; <b><i>The

          made efforts to reduce the amount of oil and gasoline used by trucks
          by complying with Roosevelt’s 40mph request. The Teamsters watched
          tire and gasoline rationing closely because it interfered with
          delivery and job security. <b><i>The Washington Teamster </i></b>reported
          this as &quot;Defense Program Is In Danger&quot;.<o:p>

          pages to its own ads promoting important ssues or favored political
          candidates. In 1941 it carried big ads urging members to vote for Earl
          Millikin for Mayor of Seattle. Other ads and articles campaigned for
          unionism, democracy, patriotism, voting, &quot;buy war bonds,&quot;

          where Teamsters fought the ILWU for jurisdiction. The Teamsters used
          the red baiting against the CIO union and its leader, Harry Bridges.
          The October 3, 1941 issue flamboyantly displays &quot;TOBIN FLAYS
          HARRY BRIDGES&quot; across the top of the front page. This same issue
          also details several anti-unionists, including Charles Lindbergh, who
          is regarded by the Teamsters as an anti-Semitic, racist and
          isolationist. Coincidentally, membership in the Teamsters jumped 50%

          involved in a complicated campaign to organize the apple packing
          plants in the Yakima Valley. When the growers and packers refused to
          negotiate, the union organized strikes and boycotts that reached all
          the way across the country. <b><i>The Washington Teamster </i></b>covered
          the campaign, clarifying in one article: &quot;THIS IS <u>NOT</u> A
          STRIKE Against Farmers But It Is A Strike Against The Dynasty on
          Yakima’s Produce Row.&quot; </font> <o:p>

          October 24, 1941 issue boasts of the union's power to control the
          city's commerce. The familiar &quot;Farmers Market&quot; sign that
          graces Pike Place Market has been changed in this half page
          illustration and instead reads &quot;Teamsters Unions Joint Council
          28.&quot; In place of the clock face on the Pike Place Market tower is
          the logo of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Two weeks
          later the campaign escalated. The November 7, 1941 issue signaled the
          start of a nationwide apple boycott with the headline, &quot;Attention
          All Teamster Unions: BATTLE YAKIMA NATIONWIDE.&quot; Ultimately the
          Yakima struggle was resolved by the National War Labor Board, the
          federal agency equipped with emergency powers to resolve labor
          disputes and prevent strikes. The board sided the Teamsters and

          overall is a very democratic and sympathetic paper, however masculine.
          I don’t think that it is a radical paper and would in fact call it
          conservative. It seems to have done a good job of giving the news in a
          news format, even if the material was slanted to the organized
          laborer. The Pennsylvania Commercial Drivers’ Conference
          congratulated <b><i>The Washington Teamster</i></b> as a leading
