<b><i>
<p><font size="2">The <em>Portland Labor Press</em> </font> <font size="2">was the official publication of the Central
labor Council of Portland and vicinity and the Oregon State Federation of Labor.
Its main purposes were to create awareness for what different unions were doing
and to endorse union supported political candidates. In later years the
newspaper broadened its focus, writing about a variety of topics including
socialism and the status of women.</font></p>
		
<b>
	<font size="2">Union Support</font></b><p><font size="2">The <i>Portland Labor Press</i> existed to serve the interests of the many
unions affiliated with the Central Labor Council and much emphasis was placed on
the need for members subscribe and support the paper: &quot;The Labor Press is
owned and controlled by all the unions of the city and it should be taken by
every one of their members. One cent per week is the cost&quot; (6/25/1909 p.1).
During the week prior to that invocation, the newspaper had gained 164 new
subscriptions. It reported that all but 20 of Portland’s’ unions subscribed
to the <u>Portland Labor Press</u> at that time (6/25/1909 ).</font></p>
<p><font size="2">One of the key functions of the Portland Labor Press was to publicize union
activities, including meetings of the various locals affiliated with in the
council. Many issues of the <u>Portland Labor Press</u> contained a column
titled &quot;Trade Union Directory&quot; (12/29/1905). This column listed the
days of the week and the name of each union meeting on that date., with the time
and location for each meeting. &quot;Fair List&quot; was another column in the <u>Portland
Labor Press</u>. Subtitled the &quot;Union People’s Ready Reference
Sheet,&quot; this column contains lists of products (for example men’s suits
and woman’s shoes) and the names and addresses of stores that sold the goods.
All of these establishments sold union-made goods. In the column there is a
notice &quot;To Merchants&quot; saying, &quot;This is not a complete list of the
union made goods sold in Portland; therefore, any merchant having for sale union
made goods of any description, can have same inserted, free of expense, in this
list by notifying the <u>Portland Labor Press</u> of what goods they may have in
stock.&quot; (12/29/1905) Sometimes the newspaper would add special features
highlighting particular consumer products. For example the July 27, 1911 issue
featured the &quot;Complete List of Union Meat Markets&quot; (p.5).</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Advertising</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2">The <i>Portland Labor Press</i> was full of advertisements. Advertisers
emphasized that they were union companies. For example there were advertisements
saying things like &quot;Union Made Cigar&quot; (12/29/1905) and &quot;A Union
Store&quot; (12/29/1905). In the August 28, 1915 issue there was an entire page
advertisement about supporting union made goods. It is titled &quot;Demand The
Label&quot; and then says, &quot;It is the cheapest and most effective way to
secure better conditions for the toilers. The great army of wage earners-as
represented in the labor movement of this country-with its enormous factory
output of $20,000,000,000, by continually advocating the use of the label, is
doing more to make this world a better place to live in than all the other
organizations combined.&quot; The page then pictures several union labels and
concludes by saying &quot;Insist on Having these Labels&quot; (August 28,1915).
Another interesting advertisement was on a page titled &quot;In Union there is
Victory To Succeed We Must Cooperate&quot; (1/13/1910 p.3). The page contained
advertisements for &quot;Portland’s Thriving Business-Enterprises Desirous of
Being Classed As the Friends of Organized Labor.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Portland Labor Press supported its advertisers and also policed them. In
the April 6, 1906 issue appeared a column titled &quot;Warning to
Advertisers.&quot; It reads, &quot;A motion was adopted by the Portland
Federated Trades Council warning business men not to support or advertise in the
name of organized labor, unless endorsed by the Trades Council. Beware of
Imposters&quot; (April 6, 1906 p.2).</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Political Education</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2">Articles dealing with political elections often dominated the Portland Labor
Press. For example the headline of the January 5, 1906 issue read, &quot;The
People Or The Crafters? An Appeal to the Voters of the State of Oregon Shall the
&quot;Machine&quot; or the people rule?&quot; The April 13, 1906 front page
features a picture of an election ticket saying, &quot;Vote this Ticket
Straight.&quot; The article says, &quot;Every Republican voter who is opposed to
the Trusts and corrupt corporations should mark a cross before each one of the
following names. Don’t pay any attention to the enemies of the common people….These
are the only candidates who have subscribed unqualifiedly to statement one. Vote
for every one of them and help Oregon to get rid of the political corruptionists…&quot;
(4/13/1906 p.1). &quot;Candidates With Union Cards A Chance To Elect Your Own
People&quot; was the title of page 2 of the April 13, 1906 issue of the <u>Portland
Labor Press</u>. This page featured pictures of the candidates as well as
descriptions of them. The May 11, 1914 issue features the &quot;Workingmans
Ticket&quot; on the front page. The sample ticket is preceded by a caption
reading, &quot;The Workingman’s Political Club has endorsed the following list
of candidates for nomination for state, district and county offices&quot;
(4/11/1914 p.1).</font></p>
<b>
<p><font size="2">Expanding Labors’ Interests</font></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2">After 1910 the <u>Portland Labor Press</u> changed its format and opened up
its subject matter, adding articles on entertainment and columns on particular
issues, including a regular column for women. The women’s column was titled
&quot;Woman and Her Interests&quot; around the title were the words,
&quot;children, education, recreation, The table, The kitchen, The garden&quot;
(December 29, 1913). Many of the articles written here discuss the Feminist
Movement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The <i>Portland Labor Press</i> also developed a relationship to the
Socialist Party. By 1913 the paper was offering a regular column titled
&quot;Department of Socialism&quot; &quot;Conducted by the Socialists for the
Purpose of Studying Governmental Problems in Oregon&quot; (12/15/1913). This
column was not necessarily for the purpose of endorsing socialist political
candidates. Articles were largely about things happening in other parts of the
world, dealing with the socialist way of life.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Today the <i>Northwest Labor Press</i> continues to represent the Portland
Central Labor council and the Oregon State Federation of Labor. Current issues
