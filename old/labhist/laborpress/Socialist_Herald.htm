		The Socialist Herald</FONT></I><font size="2"> </font>
		
		<font size="2">(April 30, 1915 - April 
28, 1916) began as a Socialist paper "Proclaiming the Co-operative Commonwealth 
and the Steps That Lead the Way" in Seattle, Washington. In early 1916 this 
paper converts to a Nonpartisan League paper and claimed to be the "Official 
Organ of the Nonpartisan League of Washington". It has earlier renamed itself 
<I>The Herald.</I> Electoral politics dominate the newspaper. The majority of 
the information in <I>The Socialist Herald</I> promotes candidates from the 
Socialist Party and later the Nonpartisan League and also informed readers of 
local, national and international news concerning labor and politics. Other 
important topics discussed in this paper are World War I, schools, and 
employment issues.</font></P>
<P><font size="2"><strong>Layout/Features</strong></font></P>
<P><font size="2">Throughout 1915 this paper has a fairly consistent layout. It averages about 
four pages long and consists primarily of news, Socialist meetings/events, brief 
editorials and ads. One regular article is "Socialist Party News" which invites 
local Socialist groups, often the City Central Committee, to promote their 
events. Another column titled "Progress" is a weekly request written by the 
business manager for <I>The Herald</I>, Joseph G. Golden, asking for funding 
and/or help with the publication and distribution of the newspaper. This implies 
that the survival of this newspaper relied heavily upon the support from it’s 
readers and The Socialist Party of Washington. The editorials are short but are 
filled with persuasive arguments in favor of Socialist positions.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">In 1916 <I>The Herald</I> shifts gears and modifies its format. Along with 
changing it’s motto and political affiliation, it also practically doubles in 
length, now averaging 6-8 pages per issue. However, this new size doesn’t last 
long as the paper returns to the original four pages in length in March 1916. 
The headings are much bolder and more intriguing. A large percentage of the 
paper is devoted to politics as 1916 was an election year. "Socialist Party 
News" was replaced with the column titled "East Side News and Views" which was 
written by the Spokane organizer of the Nonpartisan League, Will Everett. More 
pictures are included in the paper in 1916, especially those of the supported 
candidates, and also there are a few more political cartoons. Another major 
change is the greater inclusion of commentary. There is at least an entire page 
in every issue dedicated exclusively to editorials and even the articles in the 
rest of the paper seem to be much more opinionated.</font></P>
<P><font size="2">The advertisements in <I>The Herald</I> remain virtually the same throughout 
the entire collection. They run along both sides of every page in the newspaper 
except the front page. They are usually quite small and simplistic. However, the 
Bon Marché is one of the few businesses that used significantly larger ads in 
this newspaper, which made them stand out among the others. Many of the ads 
promote stores associated with the unions including Union Made Overalls, union 
bakeries, and union barbershops. Also common are ads that solicit business for 
individuals such as attorneys and medical professionals. In addition, there are 
many advertisements for restaurants most of which are cafeteria or home-cooking 
style. </font> </P><B>
<P><font size="2">War</font></P></B>
<P><font size="2">With war raging in Europe but not yet touching the United States, <I>The 
Herald </I>expresses strong antiwar views. The paper often comments on the 
unnecessary deaths caused by war, the Capitalist gain from war, and the extreme 
amounts of money spent by the government to support war efforts. The July 2, 
1915 edition includes an article titled, "War is Cannibalism" which describes 
the gruesome deaths of soldiers at war. Another article, "You Workers Must End 
War or War Will End You" (September 3, 1915), explains how the government forces 
the working class to fight and die in the war often against their will. <I>The 
Herald</I> also uses facts and figures to back up many of their articles which 
helps support the idea of this paper as a legitimate news source even while 
simultaneously promoting their beliefs. For example, the top story in the 
October 15, 1915 edition provides numbers for the amount of the war loan to date 
and gives alternatives for how the money could have been spent to benefit the 
United States and it’s people on things such as education and other 
necessities.</font></P><B>
<P><font size="2">Education</font></P></B>
<P><font size="2">Education is an important issue discussed a great deal in <I>The Herald</I>. 
For instance, the newspaper reports on the Socialist Party and organized labor’s 
plan for a School Board election campaign (October 1, 1915) and follows over the 
next few months with articles supporting labor's candidates, Oscar H. McGill for 
School Director and A.G. Dentler for Port Commissioner of the North District. 
Just before election day <I>The Herald</I> attempts to distribute a copy to 
every voter in the city with an added focus on reaching public school teachers. 
This was part of a broader <I>Herald</I> campaign to democratize the schools. An 
interesting article in the December 24, 1915 issue titled, "A Day in a School 
Where Schooling is a Pleasure" explains the ideal Socialist education as "work 
made into play", parental involvement, and specialists as educators all being 
available without extravagant spending.</font></P><B>
<P><font size="2">Politics/Elections</font></P></B><I>
<P><font size="2">The Herald</font></I><font size="2"> was definitely used to promote the political views and 
candidates supported by their staff. Along with endorsing school officials 
<I>The Herald</I> also put much effort into informing and persuading readers on 
political affairs. For example, when <I>The Herald</I> became a Nonpartisan 
League paper, every issue was filled with articles raving about this new 
affiliation and it’s growing power. This sudden change in political affiliation 
comes as quite a surprise to the reader, which may only be a result of the 
incompleteness of this collection. Included in the papers are a "Document 
Governing Nonpartisan League" (March 3, 1916), "Constitution of the Nonpartisan 
League" (March 10, 1916), and applications to become a member of the Washington 
State Nonpartisan League. <I>The Herald</I> backed it’s political candidates by 
dedicating large amounts of space for articles and pictures and also by 
including negative pieces about the opponents. Many articles were written 
encouraging people to register and vote.</font></P><B>
<P><font size="2">Labor</font></B><font size="2"> </font> </P><I>
<P><font size="2">The Herald</font></I><font size="2"> is a pro-union newspaper that includes a great deal of 
information on the labor force and strikes during this time period. Much is 
written concerning unemployment including the article, "Seattle’s Unemployment 
Problem Now Up to the People for Settlement" (August 20, 1915). Additionally, 
<I>The Herald</I> makes it a point to report on strikes occurring both 
nationally and internationally. Working conditions for women and children are 
also addressed. </font> </P><B>
