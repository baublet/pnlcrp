<p><font size="2"><strong>Abstract:</strong>The
      Philippine-American Chronicle was a biweekly newspaper published in
      Seattle from 1935 – 1936. Although its motto was &quot;For Truth Freedom
      and Justice We Champion the Cause of Labor,&quot; the paper covered labor
      as well as non-labor issues. Labor issues related mainly to the Cannery
      Workers and Farm Laborers’ Union Local No. 18257 and its attempts at
      securing higher wages and better working conditions for laborers. National
      labor news was mainly composed of American Federation of Labor news.
      General national and international news, local society news, poetry, wit
      and humor sections, and numerous advertisements were also a part of the
      paper. The paper provides information on the Filipino labor movement in
      the Pacific Northwest, but at the same time provides insight into the
      daily lives of Filipino laborers and their experiences in the Seattle
      area.</font>

      <p><font size="2">The <i>Philippine-American Chronicle </i>billed
      itself as the &quot;largest Philippine news service along the Pacific
      Coast&quot; and covered not only labor issues, but also national news,
      international news – especially that relating to the Republic of the
      Philippines, and University of Washington news. The paper also included
      society news, wit and humor sections, and articles published in Tagalog,
      the main language of the Philippines. Labor news in the paper was mainly
      focused on the Cannery Workers and the Farm Laborers’ Union, as those
      were the two industries that the majority of Filipinos worked in. Many of
      the articles focused on labor struggles in the Pacific Northwest, but
      there were also quite a few articles from the American Federation of Labor
      News Service that talked about national labor issues. The paper was not
      only a way to inform Filipinos about the state of various labor movements,
      but also a way to provide Filipinos with a sense of community. By printing
      Filipino society news, news about &quot;home&quot; (the Philippine

      Islands), and even articles in Tagalog, the paper provided its readers
      with a proof that being a Filipino in the Pacific Northwest could be a
      good thing and that Filipinos could become successful if they were hard
      working and dedicated.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>

      <p><font size="2">Much of the local labor news in the
      paper focused on the plight of the cannery and farm workers who were
      fighting for higher wages. In the February 15, 1935 issue it was announced
      by Virgil S. Duyungan, the president of the Cannery Workers and Farm
      Laborers’ Union (CWFLU), that over 1,000 farm workers were ready to
      strike if the farm owners would not consent to collective bargaining. The
      workers were protesting long working days of 10-14 hours, lack of overtime
      pay, and low wages, and the paper supported them by printing short
      speeches about how Filipinos must band together and support the workers if
      they chose to strike. In this case the workers were able to get most of
      what they were asking for and the paper heralded this as a great victory
      for the CWFLU. There were many other articles printed about various groups
      such as the local cannery workers and the Alaska salmon cannery workers
      who were asking for higher wages. Every time there was a campaign for
      higher wages the paper would print articles and speeches encouraging
      Filipino solidarity and championing the cause of the CWFLU. During one of
      these wage campaigns the vice president of the CWFLU printed a speech in
      the paper which stated that &quot;Selfishness, envy, and predatorines
      invite chaos that can be prevented a thousand times cheaper than it costs
      to cure it.&quot; This comment and several others like it were printed in
      the paper showing that the CWFLU was determined to keep the workers
      together and fight for better wages and working conditions for Filipino
      laborers.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Beginning in the May 1, 1935 issue of
      the paper a feud between the CWLFU and the Filipino Protective Association
      (FPA) came to light. There seemed to be general disagreements between the
      two about how best to improve the lives of Filipinos in Seattle and this
      led to the groups publicly criticizing one another and accusing each other
      of working against the best interests of the people. An FPA officer, Leo
      Roduta, even went as far as to file a lawsuit against Virgil Duyungan, the
      CWFLU president, accusing him and two others, Cornelio Mislang and Antonio
      Rodrigo, of embezzling $4,514 of union funds. At this time articles began
      to appear in the paper about the now public feud. Some urged cooperation
      between the two groups since they should both be working toward the
      betterment of Filipino life, while other articles accused the Filipino
      Protective Association of attacking the CWFLU and trying to steal its
      members, while not doing anything to improve life for Filipinos. The
      larceny charges were later dismissed due to lack of sufficient evidence
      and nothing more about the FPA was printed except for a short paragraph
      saying that the two groups would now try to work together when possible.</font><o:p><font size="2">
		</font>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">In terms of national labor news, the
      paper printed articles about the National Recovery Act hearings, changes
      in labor laws such as the classification of professional employees’
      wages, the varying pay rates found in women-employing industries, and the
      congressional status of the proposed 30 hour work week among other things.
      The April 10, 1935 issue printed an article based on information from the
      Committee on Social and Industrial Relations of the Board of National
      Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the USA which stated that the
      church supported the right of the workers to bargain collectively, obtain
      a living wage, and apply Christian principles to living. This was the only
      article in the paper in which labor was tied in with religion. Overall,
      about half of the national labor news came from the AFL News Service and
      so had a decidedly pro-labor, pro-AFL stance.</font><o:p><font size="2">

      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Discussion of the U.S. government’s
      plan to pay for transporting Filipinos back to the Philippines was an
      ongoing topic in the paper for some time. The paper regularly printed
      updates on the status of the bill regarding repatriation and provided its
      readers with contact information should they be interested in securing
      transport back to the Philippines. It was estimated that 15,000 to 30,000
      Filipinos were interested in returning to the Philippine Islands due to
      trouble adjusting to American life or having difficulty in finding a good
      job. The paper printed a variety of editorials and articles expressing
      very different views on the repatriation bill. Some people, such as the
      author of the above editorial, felt that many Filipinos had failed to take
      advantage of the opportunities in America and were hurting those Filipinos
      who were hardworking and industrious by remaining here. Others felt that
      some people should return to the Philippines because the country was in
      need of hardworking, highly skilled workers who could help support the
      Philippines in its quest for independence. The repatriation bill was
      passed by the House of Representatives on May 20, 1935 and printed in full
      in the July 15 issue.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>

      <p><font size="2">At least two articles about the
      Philippine Islands appeared in almost every issue of the paper. Many of
      these articles were related to the relationship between the Philippines
      and its neighbors China and Japan. Everything from China buying Filipino
      mangoes to Japan respecting the sovereignty of the islands was discussed.
      Three of the most pressing issues were the new constitution of the
      Philippines, the defense of the Philippine Islands, and trade relations
      between the Philippines and the U.S. The proposed constitution of the
      Philippines and all the proposed amendments and bills were generally
      printed in full in the paper, as well as a lengthy article about the
      history of the Philippine government. In addition, commentary about the
      proposed legislation and President Roosevelt’s reaction to it was
      usually included. When Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the first president
      of the Commonwealth Government this development also garnered heavy
      coverage. The paper had a very pro-constitution stance and made much of
      the fact that the Philippine Islands would now be stronger, better, and
      wealthier.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The threat of Japan and China and how
      best to protect the Philippines from them was also a very thoroughly
      covered topic. Whenever China or Japan signed treaties or pacts, or
      renounced them, the paper covered these developments and tried to
      determine the continuously shifting balance of power between the Asian
      nations. In addition, several articles discussed the American military
      presence in the Philippines and pointed out that American troops needed to
      have a base in the Philippines in order to protect Hawaii since it would
      most likely be the first target in an attack on the United States. The
      stance of the paper seemed to be that the American presence in the
      Philippines was not ideal, but it did provide protection from other Asian
      nations and it was good for business, so it should be tolerated. When the
      Philippines began to establish an army of its own, the paper covered all
      the military developments.</font><o:p><font size="2"> </font>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">On the issue of trade relations, the
      main topic was how the Philippines could increase trade with the United
      States. America’s efforts to ban competing Japanese textile imports to
      the Philippine Islands was the most heavily covered trade issue, followed
      by discussions of what raw materials the Philippines could provide America
      with.</font><span style="font-weight:700"><o:p><font size="2"> </font>

      related to House Bill No. 301, introduced by Dorian Todd on February 6,
      1935, which was a bill seeking to make interracial marriages illegal in
      Washington State. The bill was published in the March 1, 1935 issue of the
      paper and as written it made marriages between whites and &quot;negroes,
      Mongolians, or Oceanics&quot; (as defined in the bill) illegal in
      Washington State. The bill further proposed that marriage licenses must
      show the identity of the parties, their real and full names and place of
      residence, ages, and race as defined in the bill. This bill was met with
      anger and distaste among the Filipino community and the paper printed
      several articles and letters that denounced the bill as
      &quot;un-American&quot; and a &quot;violation of individual freedom.&quot;
      The marriage law was especially distasteful to the Filipino community
      because several prominent Filipino men, including the editor-in-chief of
      the paper, were dating, or had dated, white women.</font><o:p><font size="2">

      <p><font size="2">Beginning in the June 15, 1935 issue a
      series of articles denouncing gambling dens and their detrimental affect
      on the Filipino community began to appear. Anti-gambling sentiments
      reached a peak when the August 2, 1935 issue screamed with the headline
      &quot;Vigorous Picket Against Gambling Resorts Launched by Union
      Local.&quot; This issue of the paper contained not only two anti-gambling
      articles, but also a plea to Filipinos to stop gambling to avoid being
      caught up in the associated criminal activity. The paper estimated that
      Filipinos lost over $500,000 a year in the Chinese run gambling houses
      which were accused of paying off police to avoid being shut down. The
      paper urged the Filipino community, church organizations, and the police
      to support the anti-gambling movement and help preserve the welfare of the
      Filipino community. Virgil Duyungan, the CWFLU president, sent a letter to
      the police (later printed in the paper) giving the addresses of two
      gambling houses and Frank Meners, an ordinary citizen, took it upon
      himself to write letters to the police telling them he could provide them
      with information on the gambling dens as part of his personal campaign to
      do away with gambling in the Filipino community. Gambling was seen as a
      parasitic drain on the health and wealth of the Filipino community and the
      paper did what it could to try to curb its popularity.</font><o:p><font size="2">
