codes governing “social, charitable and other associations.” Its main purpose
was the publishing of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Socialist</i>
newspaper launched the previous month. One of the articles of incorporation
specified that only members of the Social Democrat Party could serve on the
board of the Socialist Educational Union. The newspaper came out weekly for
most of its existence, (supplemented by occasional daily editions) and
contained a mixture of articles explaining the nature of socialism,
anti-capitalism rhetoric, platforms for local election races, news of socialism
victories in the US and Europe, guest articles by well known socialists, such
as Eugene Debs and Upton Sinclair, as well as essays on socialist virtues. The
newspaper also frequently attacked its press rivals in Seattle, as well as
political rivals within the socialism movement. It provided wide coverage of
news of interest to its audience – strikes, free speech efforts and the famous
Haywood trial in Idaho. Throughout its 10 years<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>, The Socialist </i>used cartoons to lampoon capitalism and issues it
perceived as anathema to socialism. For a brief period, it even sub-titled
itself as a “cartoon weekly.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
educational union owned its own press operation, The Trustee Printing Company
in Seattle, which it bought to avoid paying “capitalist printing companies.” A
founding member of the educational union that published the newspaper was a
physician, Hermon Titus. (See editorial staff.) </font> <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

1907 when a masthead listing editorial staff appeared in the Seattle 
publication, Hermon Titus was the editor. (In a letter to the Post Office in 
1902 Titus signed his name as “business manager.”) He stayed in the role of 
editor through the last existing issue of the newspaper in August, 1910. Titus 
was also listed in the masthead of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The 
Socialist</i>, published in Toledo, Ohio and during its time in Caldwell, Idaho 
(June, 1906 - November, 1908). According to historian Carlos Schwantes,&nbsp; <i>
Radical Heritage</i>, Titus moved
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Socialist</i> to Toledo because he 
regarded it as the “industrial center of the United States.” Since the Toledo 
operation was not successful, Titus used the pretext of the Haywood trial to 
move the paper again – to Caldwell. Titus had ambitions of converting Idaho into 
the “first socialist state.” Schwantes asserted that Titus remained in Idaho a 
mere three months. The paper itself remained in Caldwell much longer, though it 
is possible that Titus himself was in Seattle. From Seattle, Titus organized 
free-speech demonstrations in defiance of authorities. The issue became a kind 
of campaign carried extensively by <i> The Socialist</i>. Imprisonment of 
participants allowed the paper to also report on the squalid conditions in the 
Seattle city jail, which the newspaper described as “Seattle’s black hole.”</span></font></p>

					The Workingman’s Paper was produced by an arm of the Social 
					Democrat Party in Seattle with the express purpose of 
					educating workers on socialists issues and positions, and 
					spreading news about socialism and labor union activities, 
					especially strikes. In addition to its line of socialist 
					propaganda, it provided news coverage of socialist 
					candidates running (and their socialist platform) for office 
					throughout Washington State, as well as school board races 
					in Seattle. The level of coverage given Congressional and 
					presidential races of 1900, 1902, 1904, 1906 and 1908 varied 
					according to the number of socialist candidates taking part.

					London, as well as translations of socialist writings from 
					Europe (Karl Marx’s among them) did, on occasion, almost 
					fill entire issues. Cartoons played a prominent role in the 
					weekly four pages of <i>The Socialist</i>, dominating the

					It provided a full reporting of election returns from

					publication. An estimated 3-percent of the voter turnout 
					went to Socialists running for all state offices in 1900. A 
					style of upbeat coverage of socialist candidates’ 
					performance typified <i>The Socialist’s</i> writings of 
					election results, even when showings at the polls were 
					rather modest. When local results did not support the 
					propaganda of <i>The Socialist</i>, it would use socialist 
					victories from elsewhere in the US and even Europe to 
					indicate that socialists could win elections. The socialist 
					mayor of Haverhill, Mass., John Chase, was held as an 
					example of what could be achieved. This was reported in the 
					issues of November 25 and December 2, 1900.&nbsp; Two local 
					mayoral candidates, E. Lux, running in Whatcom (now known as

					and key summaries from New York, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. 
					The front page included a personal note from Eugene Debs

					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On October 4, 1909, <i>The 
					Socialist</i> proclaimed in a front-page article: <i>
					Socialist Party Turns Populist</i>. The article cited the 
					recent decision by the national organization of the party to 
					amend the wording of “general demands” laid out by the 
					Socialist Party.<i> </i>Those included the collective 
					ownership of railroads, telegraph, telephone and land<i>.
					</i>The national committee removed “land” from its list of

					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further divisions opened 
					up locally over the possible inclusion of bankers, ranchers, 
					lawyers, college professors and others as members of the 
					proletariat. The division between what was described as a 
					“one-class party” versus a “two-class party” was covered in 
					the October 9, 1909 <i>Socialist.</i></font></span></p>

					<span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial">
					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s clear that the 
					newspaper – or at least its influential staff – identified 
					with the industrial wage-earners as being the basis for 
					revolutionary socialism. By October 30, the paper carried a 
					resolution from the Local Seattle Socialist Party denouncing 
					the national organization as “dominated and controlled by 
					the middle classes” and therefore “unable to perform the 
					mission of a working class party.” </font></span></p>

					<span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial">
					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the root of the dispute 
					was a fight between editor Titus and Walter Thomas Mills, a 
					college lecturer, journalist, minister, evangelist and 
					defender of temperance. Certainly the intellectual equal of 
					Titus, Mills used his writing skills to skewer Titus and his 
					“bogus organization.” Mills was a reform socialist; Titus a 
					revolutionary socialist.</font></span></p>

					<span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial">
					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When both factions claimed 
					to represent the party in Seattle, the national executive 
					intervened to broker the dispute at the 1908 national 
					convention. The bitter factional fight dragged on into 1909 
					and a state convention in Everett. Here, Titus, a 
					college-educated physician, warned of the dangers of 
					middle-class opportunists taking over the party. W.H. 
					Waynick, a sawmill worker, held sway over a national 
					executive committee-sanctioned referendum to decide which 
					faction should rule Washington socialists. Titus lost.</font></span></p>
					<p class="MsoFooter" style="text-indent: 0.5in">
					<span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial">
					<font color="#000000" size="2">The paper broke ranks with the 
					Socialist Party locally and nationally by then carrying the 
					manifesto of a new organization named The United Wage 
					Workers of Washington. It was an opening salvo in a dispute 
					that lead to the idea&nbsp; of a new political party (a labor 
					party) and the dropping of the name “socialist.” (A court 
					case involving use of the name had been heard by King County 
					Superior Court and the paper’s opponents, including Waynick, 
					apparently won the right to use of the name.)</font></span></p>

					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By this point, the 
					distancing from the Socialist Party structure was evident at 
					the newspaper, which began appearing under the name<i>, The 
					Workingman’s Paper</i>, with <i>The Socialist</i> in small 
					letters below the main title.&nbsp; The last known issue of the 
					paper, which appeared in August, 1910 included an inside

					Seattle.</font></span></p>

					<span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial">
					<font color="#000000" size="2">Under a heading, “No Private Profits –

					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first five months,
					<i>The Socialist</i> did not carry any advertising. But with 
					the merging of The New Light in 1901, the paper did start 
					carrying local advertising from Seattle merchants. This grew 
					over the years to include advertising for national 
					companies, such as Columbia Bicycles, and household

					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with advertising 
					income The Socialist was not very solvent. Its ability to 
					qualify for reduced rate mailing through categorization as a 
					newspaper was sufficiently important to warrant extensive 
					coverage of a dispute with Edwin Madden, third assistant 
					Postmaster General in Seattle in 1901-02.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

					<span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial">
					<font color="#000000" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madden contested The 
					Socialist’s qualification for third-class postage rates, 
					claiming in a letter that most of its subscriber base 
					received the newspaper free. The issue became a rallying 
					point for the paper, allowing it both to chastise Madden 
					(and pillor him in cartoons), make the case that other 
					newspapers seemed to have no difficulty qualifying and 
					encouraging readers to send in proof of subscription and 
					encourage others to buy the paper. On May 1, 1902, the paper 
					proclaimed “2500 new subscribers for Madden.”</font></span></p>

					readers to buy additional souvenir copies. In the same 
					issue, The Socialist stated that it was still $300 short in

					“interference of those who have claimed to be friends” would
