<p ALIGN="CENTER">(Paper presented at Illinois History Symposium, December 1999)</p>
<p>On December 15, 1918, the Executive Board of the Chicago Federation of Labor 
(CFL) submitted a supplementary report recommending &quot;that a weekly paper can be 
started at once that will meet the needs of the Federation. . .This paper [is] 
to be the official organ of the Chicago Federation of Labor as well as the 
independent Labor Party. . .[T]he Executive Board [shall] be given full power to 
employ first-class newspaper men and managers in carrying out the establishment 
of this weekly newspaper for the benefit of organized labor.&quot; This 
recommendation became a reality, for on January 4, 1919, the CFL published its 
first newspaper the <i>New Majority</i>. This paper became more than just an 
organ for the CFL and the labor party movement; it became a voice for the 
struggles of labor, both in Chicago and worldwide. The <i>New Majority</i> hoped 
to reach out to all aspects of Chicago society to present the needs of labor in 
a manner that all would understand and, hopefully, appreciate. The paper 
eventually changed its name to <i>Federation News</i> in 1924, a title remaining 
to this very day, and carried on the work of informing the laboring class of the 
vital issues facing labor.</p>
<p>The impetus for the creation of a labor newspaper came when CFL president 
John Fitzpatrick took the initiative to begin creating a labor party in 1918. 
The CFL made three previous unsuccessful attempts at a labor party, but it was 
not until October 6, 1918, when the CFL asked the president of the State 
Federation to &quot;call a convention in the immediate future for the purpose of 
considering the advisability of forming in Illinois an independent labor party. 
. . The CFL announced that &quot;[T]he time has now come when in order to protect our 
vital interests and to return our self-respect we must take independent 
political action. . .&quot; On January 12, 1919, the first nominating convention of 
the Labor Party of Cook County (LPCC) took place, creating a slate of candidates 
for all city offices.</p>
<p>But something more was needed to add to the movement for a political party. 
The issues so vital to the new party needed to be kept before both the labor 
movement and the general public. The solution was to create a labor newspaper. 
The CFL's Executive Board years before discouraged the idea of a labor newspaper 
for financial considerations, and it was still an issue in the 1918 resolution 
when it was recommended that such an action should not be taken &quot;until such time 
as the organizations affiliated put up a sinking fund of $100,000 and a running 
fund of $50,000.&quot; However, the need for a paper to promote the labor party 
overrode other concerns. On January 4, 1919, just before the LPCC convention, 
the <i>New Majority</i> made its debut. Using the title <i>New Majority</i> as 
both the name of the paper as well as its first byline, the paper proudly 
declared that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A new party and a new paper have been called into being by the Chicago 
	Federation of Labor for the great mass of the workers. . .Here, as in every 
	other community, the great majority is composed of the men and women who, 
	with hand and brain perform the useful work of the world - skilled 
	tradesmen, clerks, teachers, laborers, busy mothers, workers in the 
	professions. These are entitled to control public affairs and in order that 
	they may do so they are entitled also to free and fair interchange of 
	information and opinions and to correct and unbiased reports of the news of 
	current events. . .It is fitting, therefore, that in Chicago the toilers 
	should have their own newspaper, upon which they can rely for the truth 
	about things of interest to workers and in which they can find expression of 
	their point of view. . .</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Right from the start, the <i>New Majority</i> made it clear on which side of 
the road it was driving. Pulling no punches, the paper went after those whom it 
believed worked to destroy the labor movement, especially &quot;the public utility 
corporations and other predatory financial interests, constituting the money 
power which fattens off special privilege, and by their host mercenaries 
including professional officer-holders, lobbyists and shrewd, unprincipled 
lawyers.&quot; Another target were the mainstream newspapers, which the <i>New 
Majority</i> referred to as the &quot;propagandists in the interest of special 
privilege&quot; who &quot;color and distort the news of the day, dispense editorials 
devised in the interest of the powers that rob the workers and otherwise seek to 
keep the public in ignorance. . .&quot; After the <i>New Majority</i> promoted its 
mission as the paper that would tackle the issues other papers pushed aside, 
subsequent articles described the formation of the LPCC, announced the upcoming 
nominating convention, and printed the full text of the LPCC constitution.</p>
<p>While the overall purpose of the <i>New Majority</i> was to serve as the 
official organ of the labor party, the paper also came to represent the 
interests of labor as a whole. One of the paper's responsibilities was to print 
the official minutes of CFL meetings and to address labor's concerns on a more 
personal level. As Elizabeth McKillen points out, the <i>New Majority</i> had a 
&quot;dual role,&quot; for &quot;on the one hand, they sought to chisel away at the public 
image of the Democratic and Republican parties until both had been discredited. 
On the other hand, they tried to sketch a favorable portrait of the Labor party 
that would win it an increasing number of votes every year.&quot;</p>
<p>The <i>New Majority</i> needed to present the issues of labor as those that 
were of concerns to all, regardless is one was affiliated with the movement or 
not. To Mary Tupper Jones, the <i>New Majority</i> stood for so much more:</p>
<span class="style6"><i>

<p>The CFL proudly displayed its new creation, and bragged that &quot;Fifty thousand 
copies were printed and distributed although one hundred thousand copies could 
have been disposed of if sufficient help was available, and that the work to be 
done now was to get subscribers.&quot; The paper was well received in many circles. 
Nellie Baldwin, a Socialist with whom Fitzpatrick shared much correspondence, 
wrote that &quot;It was with the greatest pleasure I read the first copy of the <i>
New Majority</i>. . .I truly like it <i>very</i>
much.&quot; To Baldwin, the paper would help fuel the party's success, for &quot;I find 
women who are waking up are more willing to join the new party. People like what 
they are permitted to help in doing.&quot; The <i>New Majority</i>
was assisting in this &quot;wake-up call.&quot;</p>
<p>With the <i>New Majority</i> now established, the next task was keeping the 
paper running. When the CFL's Executive Board proposed the paper, the idea was 
that it would &quot;be owned and controlled by the [CFL] without much expense to the 
organizations if the delegates will take the matter up with their local unions 
and have their membership subscribe for it at the rate of $2.00 per year, and be 
made self-sustaining.&quot; The resolution also proposed that the paper &quot;can be 
subscribed for in conjunction with the dues of the Labor Party at the rate of 
$1.00 a quarter, which will pay both for the dues and the weekly paper.&quot; 
However, the <i>New Majority</i> suffered financially at first because the CFL 
made it clear that in order to &quot;spread information politically, industrially and 
otherwise,&quot; they would not solicit advertising. Ads would be accepted, but any 
persons wishing to advertise in the <i>New Majority</i> would have to &quot;make 
arrangements for space in the paper at the office. . .&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, subscribers alone would not provide enough cash to keep the 
paper out of the red. The CFL once lamented &quot;the failure of the organized men 
and women to subscribe for The<i> New Majority</i>, after manifesting a strong 
desire for many years to have a paper owned and controlled by Labor and 
published in the interest of organized labor.&quot; After seeing the <i>New Majority</i> 
lose approximately one thousand dollars a month, the CFL declared &quot;either get 
the necessary subscribers to make the paper self-sustaining, accept 
advertisements, find ways and means that will not only maintain a weekly paper 
but bring about a daily press. . .&quot; CFL Secretary Ed Nockels reported &quot;that 
there were now about 2,000 individual subscribers to The <i>New Majority</i>,&quot; 
and believed the paper should receive more volunteer assistance in the matter of 
subscriptions and called attention to the need of a large circulation.&quot; Charles 
Dold, a delegate and one-time CFL president, argued that &quot;this condition cannot 
continue,&quot; for if the lack of funds forced a cessation of publication, such an 
action &quot;would be about the greatest disgrace we could face.&quot; The CFL voted on 
the matter, and eventually the <i>New Majority</i> gave way to its earliest 
principles, and began soliciting advertisements, along with increasing the per 
capita tax on union members by one cent to provide additional financial support.</p>
<p>Another problem facing the distribution of the <i>New Majority</i> in the 
early days was competition from other sources. The <i>Federated Press</i> was 
another paper resulting from the Chicago convention &quot;as a cooperative 
non-profit-making association of workers' newspapers.&quot; Beginning its publication 
run on January 2, 1920, the <i>Federated Press</i> was printed in several 
languages &quot;which represented the Socialist, Farmer-Labor, and Non-Partisan 
League interests. Its membership included twenty-two dailies with a circulation 
of 339,980, seventy-three weeklies, and fifteen other papers at the beginning of 
1921, twelve dailies and fifty other sheets in 1930, and 100 newspapers in 
1935.&quot; The <i>Chicago Labor News</i> and <i>The Unionist</i>
were established long before the <i>New Majority</i>, although both papers 
suffered from the same financial problems that plagued the CFL's newspaper. In 
fact, it was the financial condition of the other two labor papers that 
originally influenced the CFL Executive Board to dissuade against establishing 
their own publication unless there was greater financial security. But to 
Fitzpatrick, any financial setbacks would be worth the risk, for &quot;if it is going 
to cost $1,000 a month to speak truthfully and intelligently and in the spirit 
of the [CFL] the price is not to [sic] great, and while I have anything to say 
about it I am not going to balk at that kind of a price.&quot; This confidence 
continued even after receiving letters such as one from Phil Broderick, of the 
Local 115 Sheet Metal Workers, who wrote that &quot;50% of the members who where 
(sic) Socialists said they did not want the Paper. . .&quot; But support was still 
lacking from the rank and file, for attention was called &quot;to the failure of the 
organized working men and women to subscribe&quot; to the paper.</p>
<p>The person chosen to head the paper was Robert Buck. Buck was an experienced 
newspaper man, once employed for ten years as a labor reporter for two 
mainstream Chicago newspapers, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and the <i>Chicago 
Daily News</i>. Buck was also experienced in Chicago politics, serving as an 
alderman from 1915 to 1917. Buck called &quot;himself a progressive Republican,&quot; and 
&quot;advocated reform of the public-school system and the right of Chicago's 
teachers to organize,&quot; and &quot;always supported legislation favorable to labor.&quot; 
Buck not only provided competent leadership for the <i>New Majority</i> but he 
also served as an active delegate for the labor party. Although the paper 
started off with the intention of focusing on local issues, Buck made sure that 
the <i>New Majority</i> adopted a more universal stance, and the publication 
began reporting on labor concerns from around the world.</p>
<p>The <i>New Majority</i> reported on every step of the LPCC, and continued to 
produce detailed reports on all political activities while the CFL, working in 
conjunction with the Illinois State Federation of Labor, moved to create both a 
state and a national party. The <i>New Majority</i> did its best to make sure 
workers went to the polls. With Fitzpatrick as the candidate for mayor, the 
paper wondered &quot;Will Labor stick on election day, April 1? That is the question 
old party leaders ask one another, in fear and trembling.&quot; On the eve of the 
election, the <i>New Majority</i> asked workers to contrast the LPCC with the 
&quot;old parties,&quot; arguing that a vote for Fitzpatrick &quot;is a vote for freedom from 
oppression of the workers of the world. . .&quot; The election results were 
disappointing to the LPCC, although not disastrous. Fitzpatrick placed fourth in 
the race for mayor, grabbing 55,990 votes, roughly eight percent of the ballot. 
But the LPCC displaced the Socialist Party as the third place political party, 
knocking the Socialists down to fourth place overall. The CFL remained 
encouraged about the idea of a labor party, and the drive for the state and 
national party continued, with the <i>New Majority</i>
still the official paper of the movement.</p>
<p>The dream of a labor party continued with the formation of both a state and a 
national party. The state convention met in Springfield on April 10, 1919, and 
the national convention, which eventually adopted the name Farmer-Labor Party, 
met in Chicago on November 22 of the same year. The national party platform &quot;was 
much like that framed in Illinois, except that it covered an even broader range 
of subject in an attempt to garner in as many dissatisfied groups as possible.&quot; 
In each case the <i>New Majority</i> was chosen as the official organ of the 
party. The paper reminded its readers that it was the responsibility of &quot;every 
member to do his or her share to bring about the ultimate victory.&quot; The year 
1921 would not be good for the FLP, for &quot;[T]he
<i>New Majority</i> was in arrears, the radicals and old parties were working 
from within, the party lacked funds, and the unemployment situation was 
undermining labor organization.&quot;</p>
<p>With each passing month and year the dream of a labor party faded, and even 
the <i>New Majority</i> rarely carried any vital party news. In 1923, the 
Communist seized control of the Farmer-Labor Party. The CFL, appalled by this 
move, severed all ties to the political party, moved back in line with American 
Federation of Labor (AFL) political policies, and changed the name of the paper 
to <i>Federation News</i> on August 16, 1924. As the new paper stated, <i>
Federation News</i> &quot;is presented in logical sequence as a direct result of the 
return of the [CFL] to the non-partisan policy of the A.F. of L.,&quot; and &quot;steps 
into the limelight as The <i>New Majority</i> discreetly recedes.&quot; The new 
paper's aim was to &quot;be fair to all in its presentation of labor's problems. . . 
It will bring facts, oft distorted in the press, in their natural state.&quot;</p>
<p>But while the labor party faded, the activities of the <i>New Majority</i>
did not. In fact, while party news was rarely printed, there were plenty of 
other issues important to labor. In the early 1920s, Illinois decided it was 
time to consider writing a new state constitution, for &quot;the old constitutional 
machinery was creaking badly.&quot; The CFL strongly embraced the idea of a new 
constitution. An Executive Board resolution stated that the &quot;Federation endorsed 
the &quot;Constitutional Convention&quot; and urges the membership to VOTE &quot;YES&quot; on this 
proposition.&quot; The <i>New Majority</i> took up the cause, printing a series of 
articles that called the convention &quot;an event of supreme importance to every man 
and woman of our commonwealth.&quot; The <i>New Majority</i> extolled the virtues of 
seating proper delegates at the convention. In April, 1919, the paper argued 
that &quot;[T]he workers must change the constitution so that big business's stuff is 
unconstitutional and not the worker's stuff.&quot; Just before the election to choose 
the convention delegates the <i>New Majority</i> again appealed to working class 
voters when it wrote &quot;How many workers in the state of Illinois care who makes 
its laws?. . .If you fail to vote for men who will properly represent you - be 
man enough not to whimper later when boss-made laws beat you down in your 
demands for living wages and some of the good things in life.&quot;</p>
<p>In the summer of 1922, two years after the convention officially convened, 
the new constitution was presented to the public, with approval to take place in 
a special election on Tuesday, December 12, of that same year. Labor's attempt 
at an anti-injunction clause and a endorsement for the rights of labor were 
voted down by the convention, Chicago's attempt at home rule and greater 
representation in the state legislature was defeated, a terrible taxation system 
was created, and many felt that too much power was granted to the state supreme 
court. One of the first condemnations of the proposed constitution was reported 
by the <i>New Majority</i> in October when it printed a resolution of the 
Painters State Conference against approval. In taking this protest a step 
further, the CFL noted that &quot;Labor's war on the proposed new Illinois state 
constitution has started off with a bang,&quot; and that an &quot;effort is also made to 
dispel the impression the other side seeks to create that the new constitution, 
while imperfect, is slightly better than the old.&quot; The <i>New Majority</i> 
printed objections from not only the CFL and the Painters State Conference, but 
also the State Federation and the Public Ownership League, who had no less than 
eighteen separate objections.</p>
<p>An organized protest against the proposed constitution was called for 
December 10, two days before the election. The <i>New Majority</i> reported that 
&quot;A mammoth gathering which will represent all branches of the labor movement in 
Chicago will voice its united protest against the proposed new Illinois state 
constitution. . .&quot; On December 9, 1922, just three days before the vote, the CFL 
once again appealed to the better judgment of its members. In crying out to 
&quot;Save Our Liberties!,&quot; the CFL printed what it considered to be the major 
objections to the proposed code. The proposed constitution was soundly rejected 
across the state, although the <i>New Majority</i>
proudly proclaimed that &quot;Organized labor alone deserves credit for the crushing 
defeat of the proposed Illinois constitution. . .It was labor that first scented 
danger in the document and labor gathered its forces and leaped at its new foe. 
. .&quot;</p>
<p>The <i>New Majority</i> was certainly interested in legal and political 
issues other than the formation of a labor party or writing a new state 
constitution. The pages of the <i>New Majority</i> and <i>Federation News</i>
are filled with articles describing a plethora of political activities. From 
protesting or supporting proposed legislation to endorsements of pro-labor 
candidates, the CFL, speaking through the labor press, was interested in keeping 
its finger on the pulse of as many issues as possible. One of the ways the paper 
stayed on top of important issues was to print articles or speeches by labor 
leaders across the country. One such instance was when the <i>New Majority</i>
printed a speech by A.F.L. president Samuel Gompers that was supposedly in 
support of the labor party movement. Gompers related his frustrations with the 
&quot;congress, elected on old party tickets,&quot; and that the &quot;hour has arrived when 
those believe in the maintenance of democratic institutions must marshall their 
forces in defense of their rights and ideals.&quot; However, Gompers was merely 
calling for political action on behalf of labor. Nowhere was he providing 
support for a separate labor party.&quot;</p>
<p>At other times the paper sent out special reporters to cover current topics. 
In 1930, as the Great Depression was starting to set in, <i>Federation News</i>
sent Martin Dillmon to St. Louis to report on the unemployment problem in that 
city. Posing as a job seeker, Dillmon investigated the &quot;regiment of leeches 
disguised as 'labor agencies.'&quot; Upon his return to Chicago, Dillmon, writing in 
the third person, said &quot;The stunt was decidedly enlightening, but what he saw, 
heard and read he'll never forget as long as he lives!&quot;</p>
<p>The paper was also a forum for the rank and file workers, allowing members of 
the movement to voice their own opinion in editorials, no matter how much these 
workers might disagree with CFL policies. It was well known that the CFL, under 
Fitzpatrick, encouraged active debate, and no matter how divergent an opinion, 
&quot;delegates were never denied the opportunity to speak.&quot; Besides an editorial 
page, both the <i>New Majority</i> and <i>Federation News</i> carried a section 
entitled &quot;What do YOU Say?&quot; The period of the 1920s saw bitter struggles between 
the building trades and employers. Andrew Shirreffs, of the Painters' Union, 
wrote that although he was a regular reader, he felt the need &quot;for taking you to 
task along with some of our undoubtedly spineless labor leaders for not 
&quot;educating the workers&quot; concerning effective remedies to the current labor 
crisis.</p>
<p>Both the <i>New Majority</i> and <i>Federation News</i> provided services to 
its readers far beyond labor issues. The paper often printed book, theatre and 
opera reviews, reported on happenings in Washington, D.C. and areas of the 
country, and even printing a short article condemning the activities of the Ku 
Klux Klan. But although additional services were offered to the readers, both 
papers never strayed from its main goal of representing the interests of labor.</p>
<i>
<p>Federation News</i> began trumpeting another outlet for spreading the message 
of the labor movement in 1926 when the CFL established its radio station - 
Chicago's &quot;Voice of Labor&quot; - WCFL. Although their petition to the government for 
a clear channel station was denied, the CFL provided vital services to the 
working classes through this forum. <i>Federation News</i>
proudly declared that &quot;[T]he sole purpose of this venture is to advance the 
principles of trade unionism. . .and to tell of the true state of affairs with 
reference to present day issues, frequently clouded by the daily press.&quot; <i>
Federation News</i> did not see the ever-growing radio industry as competition, 
but rather as a &quot;comrade-in-arms.&quot; After all, the &quot;station is financed by 
Chicago unions affiliated with the federation and by $10,000 donated by the 
Amalgamated Clothing Workers, an unaffiliated union.&quot; While the petition for a 
clear channel was denied, in 1929 <i>Federation News</i> proudly declared that 
&quot;WCFL, the pride of labor, goes on full time by authority of the Federal Radio 
Commission. . .Don't forget to put this down as you will miss the fine programs&quot; 
offered by the station. As long as the message was of interest to labor, <i>
Federation News</i> was glad to provide the outlet.</p>
<p>But how did mainstream society take to the labor press? If the rank and file 
were not always enough to keep the papers moving strongly, then certainly the 
general public was not paying much attention as well, despite the fact that the 
CFL, speaking through both the <i>New Majority</i> and <i>Federation News</i>, 
did not wish to alienate the movement from society at large. It was vital to 
demonstrate that the issues of importance to labor would serve the best 
interests of society as a whole. However, the labor movement during the 1920s, 
especially the CFL, was often seen as too radical. Moreover, the period of 
reaction that grew in America in the years following the end of World War I 
cracked down harshly on dissidents and radicals, whether perceived or real. 
Fitzpatrick admired the IWW for its organizing work in the realm of industrial 
unionism, yet that organization met its final demise through government 
harassment. When the Communists overran the labor party movement, the CFL 
distanced itself entirely from the political party, knowing all too well that it 
was political and societal suicide to be affiliated with Communists. The CFL 
bitterly resented the Communist action for years and often printed 
anti-Communist articles in <i>Federation News</i>.</p>
<p>But this was not enough to please the mainstream, who could not separate the 
CFL's intentions for a more egalitarian society from their far more radical 
counterparts in the Socialist, Communist and Anarchist movements. Therefore, 
what impact and influence did the<i> New Majority</i> and <i>Federation News</i>
have on the labor movement? Was it influential at all, especially when 
considering the many financial problems suffered by both papers? The answer is 
yes, it was influential to a point. It helped promote so many issues to labor in 
a manner that did earn a recognizable amount of attention. This is seen in the 
mere fact that the paper survived as long as it did. There was a readership, and 
the paper provided a vital service to the labor movement in Chicago.</p>
<p>But how much did the paper contribute to labor's campaigns? The labor party 
movement was a dismal failure, regardless of how much it grabbed the headlines 
of the <i>New Majority</i>. The proposed constitution convention was soundly 
defeated, for the <i>New Majority</i> took credit on behalf of labor due to its 
articles arguing for defeat and spreading the word of mass movements and 
parades. Unfortunately, there is no real way to measure how much either paper 
actually influenced the outcome of any labor issue, for if either paper reported 
a controversy, it was already well known through the labor community.</p>
<p>It is a difficult chore for any newspaper just starting out to grab and hold 
readers. For papers such as the <i>New Majority</i> and <i>Federation News</i>, 
the problem was further enhanced by the fact their mission appeared to be too 
narrow for society as whole to embrace. Nevertheless, these papers leave behind 
a wonderful legacy of what was of importance to the history of the labor 
movement, to the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois, and a fascinating 
forum for those who ideals - no matter how noble - appeared to go against the 
grain of mainstream society during the decade of the twenties. It is this very 
legacy that made the New Majority and Federation News a success.</p>
<i>
<p>Federation News</i> eventually became a 12-page tabloid newspaper. In the 
December, 1996 issue, the CFL then announced that &quot;it is no longer economically 
possible to continue the publication as a tabloid newspaper and directed the 
editor to redesign the publication into a newsletter.&quot; The newsletter is now no 
longer available to any subscriber, and is offered solely to CFL delegates, with 
a total circulation of two thousand. The very concerns voiced by the CFL 
Executive Board back in 1918 haunted the labor press into our own time.</p>
<p>Jeff Weiss, the current CFL Director of Communications, talks about the 
heritage and future of the labor press. Weiss describes how the focus of <i>
Federation News</i> &quot;is [now] strictly on Chicago labor,&quot; with &quot;no more reliance 
on national news.&quot; In the &quot;old days,&quot; according to Weiss, the reliance was on 
photos and showing the leadership in action. Now the philosophy is on the 
membership and to tell stories and not commentaries. As for the future of the 
labor press, more and more reliance is placed on the internet for the 
dissemination of information, and many locals are producing their own small 
newsletters. The volume of material being produced is simply too great, 
especially for the labor leaders, since many do not have the time to read entire 
publications. &quot;The different media outlets provide much competition,&quot; and the 
challenge to reach both the leaders and the rank and file is resulting in a 
great deal of repetition in the messages being placed before the labor movement.</p>
<p>While the emphasis of <i>Federation News</i> is now on Chicago, and not 
national issues, many of the topics covered are those of nationwide concerns. 
Boycotts, strikes, pickets, and human interest stories on rising labor leaders 
provide a fascinating look into the direction the labor movement is heading. 
Major local events such as Marshall Field's firing the Frango mint workers in 
order to move its operations out of state, and into a non-union town, 
demonstrate the while the look and length of <i>Federation News</i> may have 
changed, its nature has not with its condemnation &quot;that companies will do just 
about anything to place profits ahead of people.&quot;</p>
<p>As Jeff Weiss stresses, the point of Federation News is to &quot;keep as an 
historical record, and to be used in the present.&quot; While the Chicago labor press 
may soon move into the paperless world of the internet, the legacy it leaves 
behind is impressive.</p>
