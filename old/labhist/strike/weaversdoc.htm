<P>&#9;The Shingle Weavers' Union was the first organization in the lumber industry.  In 1886, as other organized labor associations were agitating for the eight hour work day, shingle weavers' along the east shore of Lake Michigan liked the idea and organized in order to join the fight.   The first shingle weavers' local was located in Muskegon Michigan.  Shortly there after in the large lumber center of Manistee another local formed.  At the time these locals were organized the working day was twelve and one half hours and girls were working in this dangerous industry along side of the boys.  The organization abolished female labor and shortened the working day to ten hours through a strike.  This branch of the Shingle Weavers' Union did not last long for several reasons.  One, it was loosely run and the other was the fact that most of the shingle manufacturing had begun to move west.  </P>
<P>&#9;In 1890, the shingle weavers' began to get together around the Puget Sound.  The West Coast Shingle Weavers' Union was formed with locals in Ballard, Tacoma, Snohomish, Arlington, Chehalis and Sedro-Wooley.  The Panic of '93 killed this attempt at organization.  </P>
<P>&#9;After weathering the depression, as the economy grew, the shingle weavers' realized that they were earning less than they had ten years earlier and conditions were worstening.  In 1901 local unions began poping up all around Puget Sound.  "Within two months unions had been formed in practically every shingle center from Sedro-Wooley to Kelso in the southern portion of the state of Washington" (Labor Journal 2/7/13, p. 2).  At the same time a few new locals organized in  Wisconsin and Michigan.  At that time all the locals affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.  </P>
<P>&#9;In 1913 the Single Weavers' and Timberworkers' Unions combined.  This arrangment lasted three years then the Shingle Weavers' Union was reorganized in early 1916.  This is essentually the union which survived until it was amalgamated in to the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union after World War II.  </P>
<P>&#9;Between 1901 and 1945 labor in general and The Shingle Weavers in particular were involved in many facets of human endeavor including political action, human rights and workers rights.  They were instumental in securing a higher degree of safety in the workplace, health benefits, the ten, and then the eight hour working day, vacations, sick leave and the attainment of a living wage for their workers.  </P>
<P>&#9;In the overriding and single minded effort to improve conditions for the members of the unions, there were unfortunate byproducts.  One of these is the fact that organized labor seemed to be dominated by white males.  This was true in the early history of the union movement, but there are documented accounts illustrating a very real effort to organize minority workers for example the Chinese mill workers of British Columbia from 1917 through 1921 by William E. Iverson, my grandfather.  </P>
