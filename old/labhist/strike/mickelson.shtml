They then stood on the springboards and felled the tree with a crosscut saw. Cutting above ground level was easier because the trunk was narrower, and there was less pitch to gum up the saws. Even so, it might take two days of hard work to cut down a large tree. Photo Credit: Darius Kinsey.</div>

   <p>The Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (Four L) grew to become the world&rsquo;s  largest company union soon after Brice P. Disque of the United States Army  created it in 1917. However, the historical context surrounding World War I set  up the preconditions favorable to the formation of this unique union. Before the  United States could enter World War I, the nation had to build warplanes, ships,  and barracks. This resulted in a tremendous need for supplies. With the booming  wartime economy, labor was a prime commodity in 1917. However, in the years  prior to 1917, there had been a surplus of labor. Workers had to put in long  hours for measly pay and there were no paid vacations, no pensions, and layoffs  were common. This contributed to a very unstable lower class workforce.  Establishing lumber unions was a huge task, and even the few that did exist as  part of the AFL and IWW had a hard time raising wages and improving working  conditions prior to 1917. Usually, a majority of lumber workers would not want  to strike; or if they did, the lumber company did not seem to mind sacrificing a  few months of labor in order to maintain the upper hand in the lumber industry.  World War I was the catalyst that helped change the face of the lumber industry  in the Pacific Northwest. </p>
   <p>The wartime economy of World War I required a hefty labor force in the United  States. As a result of the increased demand for labor, loggers and lumbermen in  the Northwest finally had the leverage to strike for higher wages and better  working conditions in the middle of 1917. In this paper, Part I will illustrate  how a disorganized, unpatriotic labor workforce united to work toward the  general welfare of the United Sates, joining the lumber employer and employee  into the world&rsquo;s largest company union. Second, Part II will analyze how and  why the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumber was able to draw the majority of  lumbermen and loggers to work together for the common good of both the loggers  and lumbermen in serving the United States. Part II will look primarily at the  logging publications The Lumberjack and The Loyal Legion of Loggers and  Lumbermen Bulletin and explore the strategy, the image and message the Four L  presented to loggers and lumbermen. </p>

   <p align="center"><strong>The  Four L: The Origins of the World&rsquo;s Biggest Company Union </strong></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>The  Lumber Strike of 1917 </strong></p>
   <p>The Pacific Northwest was viewed as the final frontier in the continental  United States at the turn of the nineteenth century. Loggers from the east  migrated to the Northwest because the timber harvest was abundant at the  beginning of the twentieth century. There was an abundance of land, an abundance  of trees, and many men in the forests who helped make great profits for the  employers. Companies such as the Simpson Logging Company, Weyerhaeuser,  Long-Bell, St. Paul and Tacoma were the main logging companies and earned  immense profits. Fredrick K. Weyerhaeuser owned so much land in the Northwest  that the government investigated him for corruption; but due to the way land was  sold in the region, the government could do nothing to limit Weyerhaeuser. Even  though the employers (lumbermen) earned huge profits, they passed little on to  the loggers. On average, the loggers made only 35 cents an hour working in wet  and dangerous conditions. In addition, the working conditions in the woods were  unsafe, unsanitary, and cooks subjected the loggers to food that was inedible at  times. For example, the food was so wretched in one Northwest logging camp that  one logger, A. Linquist killed the chef claiming that "God told him Ed  Gosseling (the cook) was the devil." In logging towns, it was fairly common  to hear of periodical work-related deaths occurring in the forests because  conditions were unsafe and the trees and machinery were very unforgiving in  event of an accident. Lumbermen did not want to sacrifice profits for the sake  of safety. One logging camp close to Port Angeles had two separate, accidental  logging deaths on the same day in 1915. Even though the majority of loggers were  discontented with working conditions, there was little they could do to increase  their wages or improve working conditions. </p>
   <p>Prior to World War I, work was scarce, labor was in abundance, and the lumbermen  knew it. Lumbermen exploited employees and did not worry whether or not horrible  working conditions would drive them away. After working a ten-hour day in the  woods, the "timber beast" (as the logger was commonly called)  retreated to a blazing fire at the camp. In the camp, the logger had to share  space with numerous pigs, (which were kept at all logging camps to eat food  scraps). Even though outhouses existed, they were located 100 yards or more from  the camp and were seldom used. As a result, the "timber beast" lived  in an intensely unsanitary living environment. The typical year for a labor  worker in the Northwest consisted of orchard and construction work in the summer  and lumber in the winter. Thus, the low demand for labor and constant labor  turnover prevented any real improvements in working conditions. As a result, the  wages stayed low, the conditions unsafe, and the food bad. </p>
   <p>In 1917, the United States entered World War I. With the booming wartime  economy, labor turned into a prime commodity, establishing increased demands for  all kinds of jobs in the country. The radical Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW), organized in 1905, had already terrorized many other industries by  encouraging strikes. The IWW quickly migrated to the lumber industry when they  saw the leverage the logger had on the lumbermen due to the demands of war. On  April 13, 1917, on the dangerous Montana waterways, what started out as a local  strike for river workers quickly escalated to a series of strikes across the  region by July. The IWW encouraged the loggers to go on strike for better wages  and working conditions. </p>
   <p>Before the emergence of the IWW on the lumber scene, there had been several  lumber unions of the early 20th century. Nevertheless, all were short  lived. One example was a fly-by-night promoter who created the Royal Loggers  Union in 1906. He sponsored a Fourth of July picnic and collected union dues  from hundreds of loggers. After the picnic, the promoter disappeared with the  money&mdash;and the union went with him. </p>
   <p>What separated the IWW from other unions was its organization and ability  to bring together a union and organize a strike. The IWW created pro-labor  propaganda in attempts to strengthen their union. In addition to trying to  spread their beliefs, they demanded hefty stipulations when workers went on  strike, breeding the hatred of employers. In Montana, the IWW asked for a wage  raise from $3.50 to $5.00 along with a cut in the working day from 10 to 8  hours. In addition to striking, the IWW operated in an all or nothing strategy.  If the hostile union did not get their way, they encouraged sit down strikes and  sabotages when the workers went back to work. </p>
   <p>As a result of all the work stoppages and violence, many people,  including local authorities, employers, and even other unions such as the  American Federation of Labor (AFL), were against the IWW. The AFL condemned the  IWW for its un-American propaganda and tried to persuade everyone not to support  or join the IWW. In Aberdeen, Washington, the AFL council "Condemned any  interference with the bonafide unions of this city (Aberdeen) by the  antagonistic union, un-American organization styling itself the Industrial  Workers of the World." Three days later, the Central Labor Council of  Seattle also denounced the IWW stating that "the IWW, by their radical  methods, had succeeded in erecting an insurmountable wall of prejudice between  capital and labor so far as members of that organization were concerned."  The IWW had irritated a great number of people and organizations because of  their intense antagonism and degree of success. It was highly successful at  stopping work across the Northwest in the summer of 1917. </p>
   <p>To understand the nature and significance of the IWW in the Northwest  lumber industry, it is necessary to look at the demographics of their recruits.  Many members of the IWW were migrant laborers or hobos. However, a smaller, yet  significant number of IWW members were recruited from lower socio-economic  levels of the settled workers. Such workers were naturally drawn to the closing  words of the communist manifesto: "The proletarians have nothing to lose  but their chains. They have a world to win. Workers of the world, unite!"  It was easy for the IWW to make headway amongst its men, shaping their ideas,  tactics, and actions as they went along. As the rest of the population  sacrificed for the general welfare of the country in the name of patriotism,  most if not all of the IWW workers could have cared less. Harold Hyman wrote  concerning this class difference in the United States, "The mob spirit,  always close to the surface in America and now clad in patriotic garb, was  merely accelerating a process of class cleavage that had long been under way . .  . Patriotism was an emotion that &lsquo;a bum without a blanket&rsquo; could hardly  share." The Bulletin of the 4L described this problem frequently. Looking  back on the strike, it wrote, "It was a complete industrial collapse, an  orgy of loafing and plundering. A reign of horror." By the time of the 1917  lumber strike, this lack of patriotism was to be one of the hardest obstacles to  overcome in an attempt to end the strike.</p>
   <p><strong>Preparing  for War </strong></p>
   <p>When the United States entered World War I, it needed warplanes and ships  to fight in Europe. As of April 1917, the U.S. had no airpower. However, it also  lacked the raw materials to build a strong force. At this same time, the IWW was  fomenting labor unrest throughout the Northwest and across the nation. The IWW  created much trouble for the US Government hindering the process by which they  could not get the needed supplies to build the warplanes, ships, and barracks  for the war. </p>
   <p>The US Government sought a solution to the problem of slow and  inefficient war materials production caused by the actions of the IWW. They  assigned Brice P. Disque to bring the lumber supply up to standards for the  Army. An Ohio native, Disque had been a loyal supporter of the Army since the  age of fourteen. After serving in the Philippines at the turn of the century, he  climbed his way up the Army ladder as an excellent equestrian. In an assignment  in Manila, which involved rebuilding a transport canal, Disque earned the  reputation as being good with labor relations. Within six weeks of arriving in a  foreign country with only 100 workers, he managed to recruit more than 2,000  civilian laborers to quickly finish the task. Using a bonus system, he motivated  the workers to rebuild the canal instead of just minimally fixing it for the  time being. Disque&rsquo;s new assignment from the US government was to fix the  lumber industry. </p>
   <p>Spruce was the lumber the Army sought after the most. Spruce was the  strongest, most flexible wood in the forest. However, it grew in patches and was  relatively hard to find. Lumbermen primarily focused on Fir and Cedar, however  they harvested Spruce as they came upon it. The US only produced 2 million board  feet of Spruce a month before the lumber strike. They needed five times that  amount to make the required quantity of warplanes, ships and barracks, and this  did not take into account lumber for private interests. Companies did not want  to expand spruce production because spruce was scarce. However, when they did  find it, the price was so expensive, they made huge profits and the extra  profits were seen as an extra bonus. Thus, when the entire lumber industry went  on strike July 1, 1917, it made an already bad situation even worse for the  United States Army. </p>
   <p>Though Disque held antiunion sentiments, he did sympathize with some of  the logger&rsquo;s desires. Disque said, "All sides were selfish and neither  shows any patriotism" The United States had a half billion directed toward  warplanes for the war, yet it could produce a sparse amount of aircraft because  of the lumber strike. Disque soon realized that both the loggers and the  lumbermen were both determined to win the strike. The task he began to undertake  was much bigger than he anticipated. He could not do it all himself. </p>
   <p>When Disque realized that the lumber dispute would require a great deal  of help, he recruited several key figures onto the scene of labor relations. The  first was Carleton H. Parker, a mediator. In the years preceding 1917, Parker  had mediated over 24 work stoppages. This leading Progressive agonized employers  when he said workers received a "niggardly" wage. Parker supported  rational economic capitalism and a broad based political democracy. He  integrated economics and sociology into his mediation. One of the keys to his  success in mediation was his ability to get both sides to meet face to face.  Parker&rsquo;s philosophy was neither pro-employer nor pro-employee; rather he was  for equal profit sharing in a democratic fashion at all costs trying to avoid  strikes. Parker saw strikes as a complete waste of time and money for both sides  and as an event where both sides always lost. </p>
   <p>A field representative of the Council of National Defense named I.A.B.  Scherer was also brought in to help fight the battle against the IWW. Scherer,  an anti-wobbly, was Disque&rsquo;s first mentor in labor-management relations  affecting the Army. Scherer&rsquo;s anti-union views had a considerable impact on  Disque&rsquo;s initial attitudes concerning the pattern of unionism in the  Northwest. </p>
   <p>In addition to Parker and Scherer, Disque contacted University of  Washington President Henry Suzzalo. Suzzalo was attractive because of his good  reputation among business owners and because he was respected due to his  position at the University. When Suzzalo took Disque up on his offer, he  mortgaged his academic future because the lumber controversy polarized people.  Hyman wrote, "Nothing in the state and in the Northwest region was more  sensitive than the lumber strike and the eight-hour issue. Because Suzzalo never  forgot that his state unit was designed to serve the national council and the  nation&rsquo;s interests, he was willing to risk his academic future and the postwar  political career he coveted." By jumping into the labor issue, Suzzalo  adhered to his convictions, but jeopardized his career. Suzzalo, Scherer,  Parker, and Disque met regularly in Suzzalo&rsquo;s University office to strategize  how to end the labor strike. Meanwhile, the lumber strike was just beginning to  snowball.</p>
   <p><strong>The  End of the Lumber Strike of 1917 </strong></p>
   <p>As the lumber strike dragged into the autumn and it continued to gain  even more momentum. At first, it looked as if a contingent of small lumber  companies, two major unions (AFL and IWW), and stubborn lumbermen would never  unite on a common platform. On August 15, 1917, Washington governor Lister  proclaimed the 8 hour day with 9 hour pay in an attempt to end the strike, it  looked like the end was near. However, the lumber workers did not approve of it  and on September 1, the IWW switched from an open strike to a strike on the job.  It was at this time that Parker changed his plan. Instead of focusing on the Wobblies  demands, he decided to focus on the discontented workers. Parker arrived at the  idea of government &lsquo;monitorship&rsquo; or &lsquo;stewardship&rsquo; of the logging  industry. He did not want government ownership, but rather as a means of  bringing the two sides together so they could work out their differences. Parker  had a goal of creating a working environment where men would want to work, and  the experienced logger would labor at full steam rather than malingering over  what the government needed. </p>
   <p>In the meantime, the government needed spruce for the war. On October 10,  Disque was forced to send an unskilled Army into the woods of the Northwest to  try to obtain lumber. They accomplished just as little as the lumber workers who  were striking on the job since they did not know what they were doing. To  circumvent this problem, Disque created several regiments by drafting and hiring  unemployed lumber workers. The soldiers formed a labor pool and upon requests  from &lsquo;approved&rsquo; lumber companies, the soldiers would fill in the gaps where  civilian labor was inadequate. Not only did this break the strike, but also if  any Wobblies decided to cause any trouble, there were soldiers as a police unit  to keep the peace. </p>
   <p>After breaking the strike, Parker set about designing some way that the  bitterness between the employers, the AFL, and the IWW could be glossed over.  Parker thought the only way for all sides to get along was for everyone to come  together and form a legion. Thus, on October 18, 1917, Parker, along with  Disque, in the office of the president of the University of Washington, gathered  to establish the foundation of what was to become the Loyal Legion of Loggers  and Lumbermen.</p>
   <p><strong>The Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen Become a Union </strong></p>
   <p>For a union of both employers and employees to come together and work for  the common good, there had to be numerous compromises combined with various  tactical actions. First, the union founders had to circumvent public disapproval  that the government was financing soldiers to work for private interests. Parker  and Disque came up with the idea of a woodcutters division in the Army.  Disque&rsquo;s recruited loggers joined this new division in the Army. Next, Disque  came up with the idea of a name for the division. Part of his strategy was to  bring all sides together in one group and to not use the word &lsquo;union.&rsquo; He  hoped the title, "Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen" would be an  organization everyone could rally behind in a spirit of patriotism for the  general welfare of the United States. </p>
   <p>Disque toured the region rallying support for the Army&rsquo;s newly created  Legion. He proved to be a very effective speaker and instinctively adept at  industrial politics. Wobblies, AFL men, loggers, and lumbermen all liked him.  More importantly, they accepted Disque as a neutral mediator in the labor  dispute. By October 25, Disque met with a committee of lumbermen whose total  invested capital worth exceeded $24 million. Disque convinced both sides to head  back to work with the one and only concession being the 8-hour workday. At the  time, the 8-hour day was not much of a concession on the lumbermen&rsquo;s part  because the fall days were getting shorter and the loggers could not work long  summer hours. When the loggers went to work, Disque gave each logger a  "good-looking certificate of membership (to the 4L) and a characteristic  emblem to wear." Disque, Parker, Suzzalo, the lumbermen, and the state&rsquo;s  AFL head, Marsh, all reviewed the terms of the 4L. After agreeing on the terms,  all members of the Four L went to work aspiring to log enough lumber for the  United States war time effort. </p>
   <p align="center"><strong>Part  II </strong></p>
   <p align="center"><strong>How  the World&rsquo;s Biggest Company Union Conducted Business </strong></p>
   <p>Even with the creation of the 4L and the end of the lumber strike, the  lumber industry at full force could not produce the amount of spruce needed for  war materials with the current number of loggers in the workforce. At least  38,000 skilled workmen were needed to log the region during a period of average  public demand. To produce the amount of spruce the United States needed during  the war, a workforce of over 100,000 was needed. However, the total number of  workers of the Army and Four L, had fallen far short of this number. An  immediate, pressing concern of Disque was the recruitment of new loggers. </p>
   <p>Disque levied the help of a local lumber magazine called The Lumberjack to  spread the news of the need for labor help. The Lumberjack, a lumber publication  based out of Seattle headed by the Spruce Production Division, submitted  articles from fellow loggers and lumbermen on the happenings of the region.  Disque had convinced the division that the Four L interests would be positive  for spruce production and they joined with Disque in the cause. In the January  1918 issue, the feature article was headlined, "Large Amount of Lumber  Needed." Even though the title of the article did not come across as  urgent, the content of the article read, "the necessity for an adequate  production of ships is the most serious matter that now confronts us in this  greatest crisis in our country&rsquo;s history, or in the history of the  world." The Lumberjack helped plead the case for the Four L. The Four L  needed workers and needed them immediately. </p>
   <p>Advertisements and articles promoting the need of laborers in the region ran in  The Lumberjack until mid-summer in conjunction with Disque&rsquo;s own recruitment.  By August 1, 1918, the membership of the Four L had grown to 110,000 and by  December the whole lumber community was praising Disque as the man who brought  the industry back to full working order. The Lumberjack wrote that the legion  was a "cure for radicals," and that the Northwest would never forget  Brice P. Disque." Not only had The Lumberjack helped Disque attain his  labor quota, but continued to praise the new union in hopes of continuing the  prosperity that had come to the region in the form of a healthy working  community where logger and lumbermen worked together. </p>
   <p>The Four L continued to gather strength over the following years even after the  lumber strikes had come to a virtual stop. It did not grow in size, but the  prosperity it brought to the lumber industry was a testament to the mutual  effort of both logger and lumbermen to work together. The Lumberjack and the  Four L bulletin both presented the issues, ideals, and the plan of the union and  helped the Four L grow stronger by focusing on community, communication, and  education.&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>The  Anti-Wobbly Union&rsquo;s Quest to Build the Perfect Community </strong></p>
   <p>Even before the establishment of the Four L, lumbermen despised the IWW  because the Wobblies encouraged work stoppage, sabotage, and violence. The  lumber strike of 1917 was a testament to the strength of the IWW. However, when  the Four L was created, though the majority of the members were loggers, it was  a union of anti-Wobblies. The loggers who joined the Four L had to be  anti-wobbly, and if they were still in the IWW or had sympathetic views towards  the IWW, they were not hired. For the Four L to be successful, it had to be a  community. The central focus of the Four L community were ideals of democracy,  equal rights, and patriotism. </p>
   <p>The Bolshevik Revolution inspired many workers around the world, even in  the Northwest. The Four L would have nothing to do with Bolshevism though. In  the lead story of their February bulletin, the Four L bulletin published a  speech by Disque called, "Industrial Peace Means Square Deal." Disque  spoke to the crowd stating that the Four-L was a legion only for pro-Americans.  He said, "We have heard all about the pro-German, the pro-French and the  pro-English, but the time has come when everything said in this country must be  for the ears of pro-Americans only." Disque believed that the ideals that  the IWW held were brought in from outside of the United States and the only way  to maintain American prosperity was through nativism and patriotism. The cartoon  in figure II shows a woman swatting an IWW fly, while in the distance a larger  swarm of insects threaten of Bolshevik, Sedition, and Anarchy. The message of  this cartoon was that if a person was not a committed supporter of Americanism,  foreigners would eat the cake of American prosperity. Disque expanded his view  saying, "Therefore, if we will come together to discuss our problems, and  if the man who regards himself as a laborer sits with one whom he regards as an  employer, and they get together fairly, they ought to come to the same  conclusion regarding a given problem." The solution for Disque and the Four  L for solving labor unrest and squashing the IWW was community, a very tight  knit community with homogenous views regarding nationalism, prosperity, and  anti-communism</p>
   <p>Anti-Wobbly sentiment worked well in establishing a community because it  built the foundation of a community where everyone had similar views. Not only  did the legion eliminate the radical Wobblies, but it also continued to  persecute all wobbly pretenses through the middle of the 1920&rsquo;s. The  homogeneity of views sanctioned by the Four L made it much more likely to reach  compromises on issues and not rely on strikes to settle disagreements. </p>
   <p>Though anti-wobbly views were prevalent in the Lumbermen and Four L bulletin,  other strategies were also used for building community. Many pro-society  projects were taken on by the Four L to boost support and give the members in  the legion a cause to work behind. In the April 1919 issue of the Four L  Bulletin, it published an article describing the attempt of the legion to  improve hospital service by getting rid of the contract doctor. Previously, the  employer made a contract with a doctor or group of doctors. If a logger was hurt  on the job or in need of treatment, the logger had to go to a specific doctor  and had no choice of his own. If the new plan was enacted, the logger would have  either an unrestricted free choice of any doctor he wanted to see, or at least  an organized free choice where he could visit with a doctor that was part of a  larger association of doctors. Even though switching to a plan where loggers  could chose their own doctors would cost lumbermen more, the Four L Bulletin  supported the idea. It wrote, "This is undoubtedly a step in the right  direction." By carrying through with this idea the legion would demolish  the monopoly of service some doctors enjoyed, and lessen the amount of "scamped  work" done by negligent doctors. </p>
   <p>In addition to improving the way doctors were selected, the Four L also helped  build both a brand new hospital and a new store for the use of its members. In  1925, in the city of Shelton, the Four L with the Simpson Logging and Peninsula  Railway donated $25,000 to build a brand new hospital. The area around the city  previously had not had a hospital and loggers had to travel great distances to  get any major medical care. In North Bend, the Four L also started a grocery and  supply store built for the sole purpose of offering cheep goods. The store,  owned by 200 individuals who each invested $10 to get started, offered any  member of the Four L the opportunity to purchase goods in the store at 10% above  cost, a savings of 40%. The store in its first month of business turned a profit  and saw more than $5,000 in capital. By helping its members acquire a choice for  doctors, a new hospital, and a reasonable place to buy food and supplies, the  legion helped raise the sense of community of those in the Four L. With each  project that the Four L tackled, it strengthened the legion that much more.</p>
   <p><strong>Communication </strong></p>
   <p>The Four L realized that a necessary trait in aiding the community at  large was their effectiveness of communication. Just as Disque communicated to  the people of the Northwest that the United States needed a large number of  loggers to help supply the country for war through the Four L bulletin, the Four  L continued to communicate to its members important events, happening or  decisions that took place through this same method. From community events to the  implement of new and safer equipment, the Four L bulletin was the means through  which the Four L communicated. </p>
   <p>The Four L bulletin discussed the important issues facing the legion  every month, but in addition, at least half of the articles reported minor  events effecting the community. The Four L was very proud of the new and  improved mills it helped improve and construct. When the new Weyerhaeuser Mill  in Everett, Washington, opened, the bulletin bragged that it was "one of  the finest lumber manufacturing plants in the world." It was essential that  the legion communicated the advances taking place in the region. Though certain  local logging mills had not been updated yet, reporting such events encouraged  mill workers to adapt advancements taking place to the local community. In  figure III, the new mill in Everett is displayed as the owners bragged how they  paid "real money for certain new features in its mechanical  department." Before the legion, the lumbermen used to do whatever was  possible to save capital. Whether it was new mills or recreation halls, the Four  L bulletin portrays the lumbermen as wealthy owners who wanted to brag to each  other through the buildings that they can make for the loggers. In Sandpoint,  Idaho, the Humbird Lumber Co. built a new club and recreation house with a  "splendid recreation room, two women&rsquo;s rooms, dainty decorations, one  large room especially for children, a music platform, and a gymnasium equipped  with basketballs, horizontal bars, trapezes, etc." By constructing  recreational facilities to let the loggers enjoy themselves, the lumbermen felt  they would work harder on the job. </p>
   <p>The bulletin also let the loggers know about the ultimate end product of  their labor. During the war, there were monthly photos and articles on the bay  legionaries who turned out the vessels built out of the Northwest Spruce. The  article read, "the five-mast sailing vessel, 240 feet long, 46 wide, and 20  foot hold . . . is 100% 4-L and 100% loyal." The Four L thought the loggers  would work harder and feel better about their work if they knew where the wood  they were harvesting was headed. </p>
   <p>The Four L never missed an opportunity to communicate with the legion the  good it was accomplishing and its benefits to its members. In the March, 1919  issue of the bulletin, the Four L responded to grievances about the lack of pay  and minimum salary. It explained that though the minimum salary for one day of  work was between $4.40 and $6.70 an hour (depending on the job), the going wage  was $1.10 higher and their wages would be raised accordingly if they worked hard  enough on the job. The Four L continued to answer its critics that the Four L  stole the labor ideas from the IWW. The legion said concerning the  eight-hour-day, "What&rsquo;s the difference, so long as the 4-L is keeping  it?" Whether it was recreational or had to do with salary, the  communication between logger and lumbermen helped prevent many unnecessary  disturbances and work stoppages. While the Four L was the third largest union in  the state of Washington in 1919, it was 24th out of 29 unions in the  number of strikes in that year. This statistic verifies that the Four L  successfully opened the lines of communication between employer and employee.</p>
   <p><strong>The  Role of Education and Motivation </strong></p>
   <p align="center">"The  sluggard will not ploy by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in  harvest." Proverbs 20:4&mdash;reprinted from the Lumberjack, January 1918. </p>
   <p>The Four L viewed education as a means of improving production. If the Four L  was to give loggers an 8 hour working day, the loggers would have to be more  productive to achieve the same amount of production of lumber for the lumbermen.  By educating and motivating the loggers in the ways of the forest, the legion  believed the loggers would become better and more efficient workers. </p>
   <p>The Four L&rsquo;s views toward labor were very similar to the teaching in the book  of Proverbs. The book teaches if a man does not work, he does not deserve to  reap in the harvest. The ideal of a genuine work ethic was one of the many  values the Four L tried to instill upon its workers. There were always many  quotations from the Bible to motivate the loggers in The Lumberjack. The Four L  bulletin was similar. In each issue, the bulletin would publish poems and  sayings from loggers and lumbermen that were supposed to inspire the  individuals. One saying read, "For nature is a magnet and a lure that draws  you closer as you learn her way, she lends you strength and patience to endure  and teaches you life&rsquo;s lesson day by day." Not only did the Four L  promote hard work, their proverbs and sayings also directed the logger toward  education. </p>
   <p>In addition to moral teachings, the Four L repeatedly pointed out to the loggers  all negative facts of strikes. In a coal mining strike in 1919, their workers  only received 25% of their actual request which was a huge "net loss"  considering the miners were on strike for 40 days. The Four L said, "there  are over 150,000 men who went on strike in the 2nd quarter helping to  increase the cost of living." The legion insisted that strikes only bred  more trouble and the righteous thing to do was to help educate the rest of the  public through peaceful ways of negotiating without the loss of work. </p>
   <p>The legion did not only educate the loggers morality and propaganda surrounding  strikes, it also attempted to communicate a successful business strategy. In a  feature article, the legion explained that a successful business could not spend  all of its profits on more labor because it needed capitol as well. The  pro-lumbermen article said, "Capitol is neither moral nor immoral,"  and explained how the companies would do whatever was in their means to improve  the wages of the workers who helped harvest the lumber. </p>
   <p>In figure III on page 26, a photograph from The Lumberjack was reprinted showing  eight different trees and the loggers sitting beneath them. The Lumberjack ran a  promotion offering ten dollars to the first man to correctly identify the eight  different varieties of trees illustrated. The quote in the contest read, "A  regular Lumberjack ought to be able to tell at sight any of our Northwestern  trees." Though it is a friendly contest with a decent reward, it symbolizes  the importance the lumbermen placed on education and knowledge of the forest.  Though the minimum salary of a logger was low, there were several examples in  the publications of loggers who started at entry level positions and through  hard work and education worked up the ranks of leadership to a higher paying  position with better pay. </p>
   <p>The bulletin&rsquo;s efforts toward education were not only directed at the logger,  it also aimed in the direction of the lumbermen as well. In an article titled  "What I expect of my employer," a logger explained the traits of a  good lumbermen from the viewpoint of the logger. C.H. Hoffman, the logger, said  he wished lumbermen were more cooperative and hoped they would take the  initiative toward a personal relationship with them. If this happened in  Hoffman&rsquo;s logging camp, he said he would be more passionate and willing to  work, especially for fair pay. Hoffman stated, "the employer is beginning  to wake up because of the Four L." The Four L continued its campaign to  educate both logger and lumbermen so each could become more empathetic toward  one another. In the large scheme of events, each side would learn how the other  worked and how they could work together more cooperatively.</p>
   <p><strong>When  All Was Said and Done </strong></p>
   <p>In 1938, the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen memberships had diminished to  the point that it folded. At the end of World War I the legion boasted a  membership of 110,000 members; however, it slowly lost steam. The lumber  industry enjoyed tremendous prosperity in the twenties due to the cooperation of  both logger and lumbermen; but in the 1930s, the Great Depression weakened the  lumber industry tremendously. Lumber mills closed down and thousands were  unemployed. Even the cooperation between the employer and employee could not  save the legion. For the twenty years the legion existed, it became the largest  union in the world in which both employer and employee worked together for the  benefit of the industry. In the time of war, the Four L brought an end to the  Lumber Strike of 1917 and produced enough spruce for warplanes, vessels, and  barracks for the United States. What originally was a government sponsored union  to bring lumber to the Army matured into a highly powerful legion where  cooperation, prosperity, and community were the main thought of its members. The  Four L was a testament at how employer and employee could prosper if the two  worked together for a general cause.</p>
