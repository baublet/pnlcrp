   <p>The  Seattle Union Record from December 1916 through June 1917 gives us an idea of  the struggle undergone by the women workers in the industrial labor force in  Seattle.&nbsp; Women who worked in the  laundries in Seattle during the World War I period worked long, hard hours and  were forced to work faster to receive less pay for their work.&nbsp;  As laundry owners increased prices, they refused to pay more and fired  women who joined unions or sought out representation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, women organized into unions and when their  frustrations rose to a crescendo it culminated in a very successful strike. The  struggle of the laundry workers is important because this represented a struggle  for a minimum wage for women as well as a maximum workday and most importantly  union representation. The Seattle laundry workers are great example of the power  of worker solidarity and what occurs in the build up of frustration to obtain a  fair wage and union recognition.</p>
   <p>Washington State was one of  the first four states to enact a minimum wage and an eight- hour workday for  women.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;  It is thought that women&rsquo;s activism and subsequent suffrage enacted in  Washington State in 1910 made passage of the minimum wage law possible in August  1915.&nbsp; The eight-hour workday passed  once fisheries and canneries were exempted from the law.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
   <p>During the first part of  1917, the state minimum wage for laundry workers was $9 a week for an eight-hour  workday. &nbsp;Before the minimum law  went into effect, it was reported that laundries had paid some skilled laundry  workers as much as $12 a day<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>,  whereas others made far less.&nbsp; The  laundries then paid less and less until they were paying far below the minimum  wage and many workers were receiving the same pay as they had five years  previously.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp;  In addition to lowering wages, the laundries used several other methods  to get around the minimum wage provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p>The laundry plants used a system of &ldquo;splitting shifts.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a practice in which a laundry put the women to  &ldquo;work in the morning, rush them to top speed for a couple of hours, ring a  gong and stop their time when the work immediately in sight was disposed of and  without previous notice; after an hour or two again putting them to work and in  that way compelling them to be present on the job for periods of from ten to  twelve hours for pay for from four to eight hours.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp;  This practice of having the women work faster over more hours for less  money was upheld in the courts with the decision of <em>Rose Bishop v. Model  Laundry Co</em>,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> in which the judge refused to hear the case.</p>
   <p>In  1915, the Laundry Owners Association had attempted to produce legislation making  laundry workers exempt from the eight-hour workday law.&nbsp; The owners again tried to fight the legislation in February  1917 actually claiming that the girls employed in the plants wanted a longer  working day.&nbsp; The legislative agent  of the Washington State Federation of Labor, H.L. Hughes was reported to have  dismissed this claim stating, &ldquo;No laundry girl has ever come to us asking for  a longer work day.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
   <p>At  this time, the laundry workers made very low wages, were on call at all times,  and were prevented from joining a union.&nbsp; To  avert this latter issue, the Seattle Federation of Women&rsquo;s Clubs, under the  presidency of Viola G. Crahan began organizing &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; rather than unions  for women laundry workers.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> Women then had the ability to voice grievances amongst themselves, yet they  still had no capacity to argue for higher wages or better working conditions.&nbsp;  Mutual Laundry was a union shop and its workers were represented through  Laundry Workers Local no. 24.</p>
   <p>The  Laundry Workers Local met Wednesday evenings at Mutual Laundry.&nbsp;  The Seattle Union Record gives us a useful picture of the labor culture  in the Laundry Union in Seattle in 1917.&nbsp; Weekly  articles relay information about where and when union meetings are held.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp;  It informs the reader of whom the elected officers of the union are.  Social events for the members, such as dances were fairly commonly occurrences.&nbsp;  Newlywed couples were given gifts from the union, for example, an  electric reading lamp.&nbsp; There was  usually some meal, such as &ldquo;supper&rdquo; or a &ldquo;big feed,&rdquo; to encourage  members to attend meetings; and the number of new members was reported.&nbsp;  The man who usually wrote the articles about the union meetings was Carl  E. Lunn.&nbsp; Lunn was also the  vice-president, declared president February 1917<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> of the local Laundry Union and constantly fought for the rights of the  &ldquo;girls&rdquo; in the laundries.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;The  Seattle Union Record reported that at that time, only Mutual Laundry paid the  state minimum wage, however Mutual Laundry was cooperatively owned<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> and controlled by organized labor.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Union Record stated that nearly every other laundry in Seattle broke  the law in regards to the wage scale.&nbsp; Workers  in the laundries were forced to &ldquo;sign a petition requesting their exemption  from the law&rsquo;s application&rdquo; according to Joanna Hilt, who was later to  become the business agent for the Laundry Workers Union after being blacklisted  by the Laundry Owners Association.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Most  &ldquo;girls&rdquo; received $6 a week through apparent abuse of what was referred to as  &ldquo;the apprenticeship clause.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>&nbsp;  I am unsure of the details of this clause, however it appears that  employers were not required to pay apprentices the state minimum wage, and  therefore claimed that their workers were apprentices rather than the skilled  labor they truly were.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>In  1917, laundries were one of the few places for women to work. The Seattle Union  Record dramatically describes the women who work in the laundries as &ldquo;girls  without any family support and many widows with babies to feed and clothe.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a>&nbsp;  According to Richard Berner in his historic accounts of Seattle,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a> women laundry workers in Seattle in December 1916, earned wages averaging $5.87  a week, or anywhere from $3 to $8 a week.&nbsp; Berner  points out that such a wage was far lower than the common laborers, typically  men, who earned $2.75 to $3.00 a day.</p>
   <p>Under a big banner headline, the Seattle Union Record reported in April  1917, that Mutual Laundry was going to increase pay for its employees to $10 a  week.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a>&nbsp;  This was great news for the laundry workers at Mutual, however the Union  Record also states that the wages should really be $12 a week, as a livable  wage.&nbsp; Word got around about the  wages paid by Mutual and workers in other laundries began ask for similar wages.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a>&nbsp;  Near this same time, the laundry workers also began demanding city  legislation prohibiting night work and the use of basements for laundry  locations.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a>&nbsp;  As Richard Berner states, &ldquo;given the labor shortage and the steady  attraction of women into the industrial labor force, the time appeared ripe to  deal with the laundry owners.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a></p>
   <p>In May 1917, the laundry  workers union adopted a new slogan: &ldquo;Activity is the Key to Success.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a>&nbsp;  The union refused to sit idly by waiting for changes to occur.&nbsp;  The Union Record stated, &ldquo;we told you, the Laundry Workers are a live  scrapping bunch.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a>&nbsp;  The Laundry Workers Union hired a woman as its business manager, Joanna  &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; Hilts, who is described as &ldquo;possessing an extra large supply of  fighting energy&rdquo; so as to engage in a &ldquo;gigantic struggle&rdquo; for better  working conditions.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a>&nbsp;  The women began demanding that all customers solely use laundries that  were &ldquo;union shops.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Seattle  Union Record was vehement that a person&rsquo;s responsibility was to patronize  union-only laundries stating, &ldquo;union men, please remember&hellip;look for the label  on your list, the only guarantee that the girls inside, as well as the men, are  getting living wages.&nbsp; Be  consistent.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Mutual  Laundry was well rewarded for its break from the Laundry Owners Association and  its union status.&nbsp; The Seattle Union  Record mentioned Mutual Laundry in nearly every article about the Laundry  Workers Union and constantly reminded people to only use Mutual Laundry.&nbsp;  In addition, the paper encouraged its readers to check the labels with  the Laundry drivers to ensure that the women working in the laundries are  receiving union wages.&nbsp; Mutual&rsquo;s business continued to expand, and they proudly  reported it had grown to such an extent that they needed two phone services.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a></p>
   <p>The  Seattle Union Record made it very clear to its readers that the majority of  Laundries were treating their employees quite poorly.&nbsp;  The non-union laundries raised prices anywhere from 10-25% without giving  the women workers raises.&nbsp; The Union  Record encouraged all those who worked in the Laundries to join a union to  demand a living wage.&nbsp; The Laundry  Owners Association retorted that the women were trying to drive them out of  business by insisting on higher wages.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>The  Laundry Owners&rsquo; Association tried to discourage the women from joining the  union.&nbsp; They attempted to negotiate  on an individual basis with only those who would withdraw from organized labor.&nbsp;  If a woman refused to leave the union, she was dismissed from her job.&nbsp;  In early June 1917, dismissals became very common.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a></p>
   <p>On  Thursday, June 14, 1917, livable wages became an explosive issue, when the  laundry workers realized the futility of waiting for the Laundry owners to  increase their pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The  Seattle Union Record headline blazed &ldquo;900 Laundry Workers Out: Girls at Last  Revolt at Starvation Wages.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a>&nbsp;  The workers finally went on strike to demand wages that were fair and  equal along with union recognition.&nbsp; By  Saturday, the <u>Seattle Daily Times</u> reported that while the employers dug  their heels in &ldquo;to the finish,&rdquo; the laundry workers were gaining the support  of the laundry drivers who also threatened to walk off the job, making the  strike general.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>When  the Laundry Owners Club also refused to acknowledge the drivers union, the  laundry drivers joined the strike.&nbsp; The  Laundry Owners then ran ads in the daily newspapers stating how well paid the  drivers were and how they ought to consider themselves lucky that they made  wages of $20 a week.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a>&nbsp;  This was an attempt to turn public opinion against the laundry strike,  and especially deceive the public into believing the women working in the plants  made decent wages and therefore had no real grievance.</p>
   <p>The  Laundry Owners tried many tactics to turn away unions and break the strike.&nbsp;  First, they ran ads stating the union was simply trying to aid Mutual  Laundry with the strike.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">[31]</a>&nbsp;  The Owners also tried to convince the women who worked in the plants that  the union was only trying to get the women&rsquo;s money through dues.&nbsp;  The ploys were unsuccessful and public sympathy remained with the women.</p>
   <p>It  was reported by the Seattle Union Record that even veterans in the labor  movement were surprised at the response from women in the laundry plants.&nbsp;  There was not one &ldquo;desertion from the ranks&rdquo; since the strike began.&nbsp;  On the contrary, the union recruited 600 new members in the first week of  the strike and the numbers of striking laundry workers and drivers grew to 1500.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a></p>
   <p>The  laundry unions made note of the fact that the Laundry Owners Club was paying  thousands of dollars to bring in strikebreakers from out of town, yet were  unwilling to spend the money for better wages.&nbsp;  Ironically, the Owners then offered women who did not join the union,  approximately 15% of the workers, nearly identical wages to what the unions were  demanding.&nbsp; The owners simply  refused to acknowledge or accept the union<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title="">[33]</a>.</p>
   <p>The  Union Record pokes fun at the Laundry bosses in its articles as well.&nbsp;  It reports how the non-union trucks carry strike guards, stating &ldquo;there  (are) grave fears entertained by the employers that the girls may storm the  rapidly moving motor cars and stick the heroic strikebreaker with a hat pin.&nbsp;  He might develop blood poison, and-strikebreakers are scarce these  days.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[34]</a></p>
   <p>The strike engaged by the laundry workers was very successful.&nbsp;  Within hours of the announcement of the strike, two laundries, Enterprise  Laundry and Nelson Laundry signed up with the union.&nbsp;  Friday morning each laundry put their union employees to work by 8:00 am.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[35]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The strike was supported by the community.&nbsp;  The local Teamsters union gave Laundry workers local 24 over $250.&nbsp;  The Ballard Mill Workers gave $2000 to striking workers,<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[36]</a> and many of the picketers reported passersby stopping to donate money to their  cause.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">[37]</a></p>
   <p>The  non-union laundry industry became &ldquo;crippled&rdquo; by the strike.&nbsp; Laundries&rsquo; business dropped to one third of its former  business level and some companies folded.&nbsp; The  strike also affected other businesses.&nbsp; The  first business to take the brunt of the laundry strike was the hotels in  Seattle.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title="">[38]</a>&nbsp;  They believed they could wait out the strike by switching to paper  napkins, then paper tablecloths, but eventually realized that bed linens were a  necessity and then urged the Laundry owners to settle the strike.&nbsp;  The three union plants, Enterprise and Nelson along with Mutual became  overwhelmed with extra business and had to run three shifts to handle the  business.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[39]</a></p>
   <p>On  July 7, 1917, the third week of the strike, the Seattle Union Record reported  conferences between the union representatives and representatives of the  &ldquo;laundry owners Association.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="">[40]</a>&nbsp;  There was speculation that the workers may receive their fair wages.&nbsp;  This was the first time the owners were willing to negotiate with the  union, after having profusely refused up until this point.&nbsp;  There were several apparent reasons for the owners to negotiate.</p>
   <p>One  reason for the talks was a serious rift in the Laundry Owners Club occurred when  Proprietor Williams of the Peerless Laundry announced his laundry would be a  union laundry.&nbsp; The Laundry Owners  Club filed a lawsuit against Williams for &ldquo;breaking his pledge to the  Association.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[41]</a>&nbsp;  Public support of the strikers had been growing and the publication of  the lawsuit in local newspapers convinced the workers that they would win the  strike.</p>
   <p>Another reason for the talks was simply financial.&nbsp;  The owners were losing too much money paying the &ldquo;scabs&rdquo; bonuses in  addition to their reduced business income.&nbsp;  Another was the cost incurred by employing two men to drive the laundry  wagons, the solicitor-driver and the guard.&nbsp;  The owners also realized the tremendous business the union laundries were  getting at their expense.&nbsp; The  decision to negotiate was implemented with the arrival of the president of the  International Laundry Workers&rsquo; Union, James Brock in Seattle<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[42]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>James  Brock provided the experience necessary for dealing with the owners&rsquo;  association.&nbsp; He patiently organized  repeated conferences with owners of the laundries that continually refused to  acknowledge the union.&nbsp; The  laundries were giving in to some of the demands of the workers, such as higher  wages, yet continued to refuse the union.</p>
   <p>On  July 11, Brock announced a blanket agreement to end the strike.&nbsp; All the laundry establishments except for one were willing to  pay union scale of wages to inside workers, engineers and drivers and were being  operated simply as union institutions.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[43]</a>&nbsp;  The employees that had been discharged due to their involvement and  activities within the strike were reinstated as part of the blanket agreement.</p>
   <p>The  strike agreement called for a minimum wage of $9 a week with an eight hour day  for inside women apprentices, and a minimum wage of $10 a week with an eight  hour day for women journeymen with the number of apprentices limited.&nbsp;  The engineers were given a $5 a week raise to $28 to $30 a week for a  fifty-one hour workweek.&nbsp; The laundry drivers were given raises based on the amount of  work they brought in to be between $18 and $20 a week, still far more than the  women workers<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[44]</a>.</p>
   <p>While  the union considered these pay increases to be great concessions, the greatest  feat was that now &ldquo;the unions have full power to adjust all differences  between employees, and with recognition of the union by the employers, only  union employees can be employed hereafter.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[45]</a></p>
   <p>The strike and settlement were also boosts to union involvement by women.&nbsp;  The first ten days of the strike enlisting over 600 women to the Laundry  Workers Union with over 85% of the women laundry workers eventually joining the  union.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="">[46]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>The  strike of the laundry workers in Seattle in 1917 proved the ability of workers  who band together to change their employment circumstances.&nbsp; While laws were in place to give workers in the laundries  livable wages and working conditions, they were ineffective in helping the women  workers in the laundry plants either receive a fair wage along state guidelines  or ensure that the employers followed the principles of maximum hour  restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Until  the strike, union representation for the workers in the laundry plants was  nearly nonexistent.&nbsp; Becoming a part  of organized labor, the women&rsquo;s solidarity gave them the strength and courage  to fight back against a very power Owners Association, and to make a difference  in their working situation.&nbsp; Of  course, women&rsquo;s pay equality was still unattainable; yet they did gain the  ability to make a significant difference.&nbsp; Now,  the women had union representation, which meant fairness in pay and closer  adherence to the laws.&nbsp; As aptly  stated in the Seattle Union Record, &ldquo;The only way to make labor laws effective  is to build effective labor organizations-and then laws will not be needed so  much.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title="">[47]</a>&nbsp;  In the era before washing machines, laundries were vital and the women  working in them deserved fair pay and union representation.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We  don&rsquo;t blame the tailor</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When our pants we have to pin;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  We do not blame the shoeman</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When our shoes grow old and thin;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  We do not blame the hatter</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When our lids we have to flout;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  But we always blame the laundry</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When our shirts wear out.<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gregoryj/strike/reimer.htm#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[48]</a></p>
