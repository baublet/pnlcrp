</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Anna Louise Strong was an enigmatic character who embodied multiple roles in the Seattle General Strike of 1919. Born in Nebraska in 1885, Anna Louise was heavily influenced by her heritage throughout her life. Her writings reflect both the religious convictions inherited from her minister father and the determination to fight social injustice derived from a mother who abhorred the disenfranchisement experienced by women and African-Americans.</P>
<P>An incredibly gifted writer, Anna Louise became somewhat of a celebrity in Seattle through her multitude of editorials and poetry during the era leading up to Seattle General Strike. In 1917 she began to work for the Seattle Union Record, an opportunity which she utilized to display her seemingly many political voices. Most of her notoriety as a writer originated from her daily ragged verse poems, signed Anise, that wove some kind of individual perspective with the larger scope of labor politics. Of course, her most popular article, which she left unsigned, was perhaps the infamous NO ONE KNOWS WHERE editorial written after the Seattle General Strike broke out.</P>
<P>Eventually disillusioned with the labor movement in Seattle soon after the strike failed, Anna Louise would leave to pursue her quest for social change and peace in other nations; however, her years spend in Seattle proved to radicalize Anna Louise. Her journalism on the I.W.W. trial, her fight to stay on the Seattle school board, and her influential writing in the Seattle Union Record would remain nostalgic experiences for Anna Louise throughout the rest of her life.</P>
