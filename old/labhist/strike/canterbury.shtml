   <p> The Northwest lumber industry in the early part of the 20th century was, at its  best, rugged, at its worst, brutal. Logging in the forests of the pacific  northwest usually began in early summer and continued into late fall. In some  camps men worked well into winter fighting wind, snow, and wood. Often the best  timber was located deep in the backcountry, far from any semblance of  civilization. Deadfalls and bucking saws were only a few of the dangers faced  daily by woodsmen. Rarely working less than ten hours a day at 35 cents per  hour, timbermen were given only the most rudimentary of conveniences. Meals were  served in common dining halls where few words were spoken. Once fed, the tired,  filthy men retired to large bunk-houses. The bunk-houses customarily only  contained stoves at either end, frequently obscured by drying clothes. Bedding  was generally a wooden box containing some small amount of vermin infested  straw. The situation was not much better in the lumber mills where many of the  same conditions persisted. Shingle weavers&rsquo; stood then or more hours per day,  passing their hands within slight distances of saw blades, often severing a  finger or hand. Long hours, dangerous working conditions, low pay, and  unsympathetic foremen all contributed to the disagreeable nature of timber work. </p>
   <p>The men who worked in this industry were as distinctive as their work.  Fiercely independent these men took pride in the only thing they had: their  skills as workers. Very few men had any family; fewer still had any family at  the camp. This lack of family was a primary cause of stress and turnover. After  a long day in the forest, they would sit around the bunk-house to discuss a wide  variety of topics, from the day&rsquo;s work, to their pending trip to town, to  abstract points of economic theory. Many of the lumber workers did not have any  particular ties to one place or area and frequently moved on whenever it suited  them. The isolation and transient lifestyle of timber workers made most of them  unable to vote. With few ties so society and an insecure economic future, these  men had little to lose. This disposed many towards unions or other forms of  protest although they were rarely successful. </p>
   <p>Unfortunately for these workers organizing was exceedingly difficult. In  the early twentieth century judicial rulings hobbled union&rsquo;s abilities to  combat management making labor organizing of any kind arduous. The federal  government also took an active role in the economy. However, although some  politicians, notably Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson, were friends of  labor, their efforts often had mixed results. The lumber industry itself held  additional challenges to organization. The barons of the industry were  exceedingly stubborn; some even considered working conditions and wages ideal.  The economic policies of the lumbermen were shortsighted, narrowly focused on  profit and unyielding to any requests of labor. Furthermore, simply reaching the  workers was often a challenge. Although some mills were in towns, many were  located in the forest. Timber camps were even more remote and changed locations  as the timber fell. </p>
   <p>In this environment few unions lasted more than a small number of years  or made significant advances wages or working conditions. One union however,  endured for just over ten years. The International Union of Timberworkers,  chartered in 1913, managed to survive, sometimes narrowly, into 1923. Although  the Timberworkers faced the same difficulties in organizing that beset all  unions just after the turn of the century, as well as those particular to the  timber industry, they also contended with unique factors that not only curtailed  their efficacy as a union but causes their dissolution as well. As an AFL  affiliate acquiring permission to organize industrial workers was the first  obstacle. </p>
   <p>The strikes that seemingly caused the initial decline of the Timberworkers could  have been won were it not for the extraordinary intransigence of lumbermen.  Wartime military intervention in the form of the Loyal Legion of Loggers and  Lumbermen, though, was the greatest challenge the Timberworkers faced. Even  though there were other lumber unions in the Northwest, the leadership of the  Loyal Legion had a particular distaste for the Timberworkers that manifested  itself in Legion practices and policies. Thus, were it not for this personal  hatred, the Timberworkers quite possibly could have emerged from World War One  strong enough to survive the depression of 1921. Although the officers to the  Timberworkers would have liked to accomplish more than they did, the efforts of  the Loyal Legion and IWW opposition to the Timberworkers effectively restricted  their ability to achieve many of their goals, either by direct opposition or by  requiring counter-propaganda. Raymond Canterbury was the final president of the  Timberworkers and the man to whom the responsibility of maintaining the union  through the 1921 depression fell. Raymond&rsquo;s passion and dedication, however,  were not enough to sustain the union. </p>
   <p>Prior to 1912 there were a great many unions in the sawmills and  timberlands. However, most of these were small, unsuccessful and short lived.  Part of the problem for organizers lay in reaching the workers. Timber camps  were dispersed over a vast area and attracted men from an even wider area when  work was available. These men scattered in slack periods making the maintenance  of an organization quite problematic. That the same men did not always return to  the same camp exacerbated this problem. </p>
   <p>The first viable attempt by the American Federation of Labor to organize  these scattered woodsmen came in 1905 when it organized the International  Brotherhood of Woodsmen and Sawmill Workers. The IBWSW was not very successful  either and, in 1911, the AF of L revoked its charter, ostensibly for failure to  pay their per capita tax. At this time the Shingle Weavers Unions, chartered in  1903, was one of the few surviving lumber unions in the Northwest. Late in 1912  the Shingle Weavers petitioned the AF of L to extend the jurisdiction of the  Shingle weavers to include the unskilled and semi-skilled labor of the mills and  timberlands. They argued that "by including this class of work-men under  our jurisdiction many of the causes of the previous failures to get a permanent  organization of the woodsmen and sawmill workers will be removed." However,  it seems likely that not only was this an attempt to increase their bargaining  power and political clout but to stop the Industrial Workers of the World as  well. For whatever reasons, the Shingle Weavers voted at the 1911 convention to  organize all workers in the timber industry under the banner of the proposed  International Union of Shingle Weavers, Sawmill Workers, and Woodsmen. The  following year they demanded that the AF of L extend their jurisdiction to all  timber employees and grant them autonomy. </p>
   <p>The Shingle Weavers knew that they would not have an easy time securing  their objectives. Indeed, the AFL of 1912 frowned on organizing unskilled labor.  Further, the Shingle Weavers asked for significant assistance to accomplish the  proposed feat in the form of four special organizers. However, some recent  changes in AFL policy proved beneficial to the Shingle Weavers cause. The AFL,  although still trying to uphold ideals set forth in the Scranton Declaration of  1901, nonetheless recognized the changes taking place in wage labor and union  organization. The formation of employers&rsquo; associations like the Lumbermen&rsquo;s  Protective Association necessitated powerful union for any change to be  actualized. With this in mind, the AFL began to encourage, and later mandate,  the amalgamation of smaller unions. However, amalgamations were only to take  place along trade lines. Furthermore, the AF of L was also looking more  favorably upon trade autonomy. A resolution passed by the Executive Council in  1912, just in time for the Shingle Weavers, declared that the AFL would  wholeheartedly endorse trade autonomy. The move by the Shingle Weavers also  received support from the Everett Trades Council. It should be noted though,  that, except for the Everett endorsement, these events took place concurrently  with the Shingle Weavers demands; it is doubtful that the voting members were  aware of them when they decided upon their course of action. </p>
   <p>Perhaps the AFL conceded to their demands because the Shingle Weavers  were a powerful union. More likely though, is that the AFL recognized the  character of the average timber worker and feared the Industrial Workers of the  World would find a warm welcome in the sawmills and logging camps, thus  decreasing the AFL power base while increasing that of the IWW. Hence the  International Union of Timberworkers was, in large part, an attempt by the AFL  to stop the IWW in the Northwest. Whatever the official or covert reasons for  acquiescing to the demands of the Shingle Weavers, the International Union of  Shingle Weavers, Sawmill Workers, and Woodsmen was formally chartered on January  15, 1913. The name of the IUSWSWW, being far too cumbersome, was changed at the  1914 annual convention to the much more efficient International Union of  Timberworkers. </p>
   <p>The Executive Board of the AFL did not grant the Shingle Weavers demands  without reservation. Part of the petition contained a proviso stipulating that  if the union failed to organize the sawmill workers and woodsmen the AFL could  recall its charter, rescind its jurisdictional extension and reissue a charter  to the shingle weavers as the International Shingle Weavers Union of America. </p>
   <p>The initial organizational structure of the IUT closely followed the  organization of the Shingle Weavers union. The president of the Shingle Weavers,  J.G. Brown, maintained his position in the new union, as did the other officers.  In larger mills and mill towns, where there were substantial numbers of  different types of workers, locals were organized by trade or skill. The intent  was to have separate locals for loggers, shingle weavers, mill workers, etc.,  all under the jurisdiction of the IUT. In smaller mills or camps one local  sufficed. The power to call a strike was not exclusive to the Executive Board;  each local was given the authority to call a strike by a referendum vote of two  thirds, although a general strike could only be called by a state or union wide  referendum. In this manner the Timberworkers upheld the AFL ideals of trade  division while maximizing the number of organized laborers. This argument also  had the benefit of maximizing bargaining power and solidarity. By having  separate locals for each skill wherever possible locals were able to negotiate  independently with the management of the mill. The strike of one local did not  necessitate the strike of another, thus alleviating some of the stress caused by  union membership. The opposite was the case in the small mills and camps. With  all workers belonging to the same local the impact of any job action would be  widespread, not in terms of numbers of people but in effect on the mill or camp.  This gave otherwise solitary workers a needed sense of solidarity. Although this  arrangement tended to make some locals more powerful than others, it was  nonetheless an effective method of power maximization. </p>
   <p>The IUSWSWW/IUT (hereafter simply IUT) did not allow its newfound  jurisdictional and organizational challenges to hinder its activities as a  union. Indeed, while still in the initial stages of formation, they called a  strike in Grays Harbor in 1911. The union was actively organizing in the area  when, on October 10, 1911, two mills discharged every union employee. The union  called a strike that later merged with the IWW strike of March 14, 1912. When  the employers settled with the IWW, most of the IUT&rsquo;s demands were met. This  early victory, gained with the assistance of the IWW, soon came back to trouble  the Shingle Weavers. At the 1912 convention a referendum to resign AFL  affiliation in favor of IWW affiliation was introduced but unanimously defeated.  Some historians contend identical resolutions were introduced at subsequent  conventions for several years. </p>
   <p>Once the constitution of the International Union of Timberworkers was  appropriately modified at the January 1913, convention in Portland, Oregon, the  union set down to business. Organizing efforts went well; when the AFL  convention met in mid November the Timberworkers claimed 3,100 members. Total  employment in the timber industry in Washington state was approximately 26,290;  20,538 of which worked in mills. However, The seemingly small number of  Timberworkers belies their strength as most of the Timberworkers&rsquo; membership  was in the western Cascades. Having rapidly accumulated members it is not  surprising that the Timberworkers began workplace actions quickly. It is  generally admitted that the Executive Council&rsquo;s misjudgment of employers and  their perceived betrayal of locals contributed to the general decline in  membership and the Shingle Weavers departure from the union, though perhaps the  Timberworkers&rsquo; excessive zeal in work actions did as much to dissuade  potential members and discourage current ones. </p>
   <p>In April 1913 the IUT shingle weavers local of Ballard presented a set of  demands to the management of the local shingle mills. The shingle weavers  demanded consonance with the union wage scale, improved working conditions, and  union recognition. When their demands were ridiculed by mill owners, 300 shingle  weavers struck. Almost all the shingle mills in Ballard shut down; a few kept  open but only ran one or two machines. Membership continued to climb during the  first month of the strike and success seemed imminent. Confidence remained high  for months but by late summer the striking workers had had enough. Imported  strike breakers and vicious attacks by employers (including an effort to frame  the union for an attempted bombing) took their toll. Although the union voted on  July 17 to call off the strike, they did not admit defeat but maintained that  their decision was a strategic response to circumstances beyond their control. </p>
   <p>The United States judiciary in the Progressive era created some to these  circumstances. Although the rulings of the Supreme Court do not seem to have  directly effected the IUT substantially they nevertheless had a significant  affect on organized labor overall. The rulings of the Court in landmark cases  conveyed to organized labor the knowledge that the courts were not supporters.  The antipathy of the Supreme Court was apparent in the judgments of the Iron  Molders International Union versus Buck&rsquo;s Stove and Range Company and the  United Hatters&rsquo; Union versus E.W. Lowe. When the Iron Molders union declared a  boycott of Buck&rsquo;s Stoves the AFL placed the company on its "We Do Not  Patronize" list. The courts ruled, in 1907, that the AFL must remove  Buck&rsquo;s from the list as it restrained interstate commerce under the Sherman  Act. Gompers refused, citing first amendment free speech rights. In turn the  courts found Gompers and two associates guilty of contempt and sentenced them to  fines and jail terms. The United Hatters&rsquo; Union in Danbury, Connecticut,  called a boycott to which Lowe objected based on the Sherman Act provisions  regarding restrictions of interstate trade. The courts&rsquo; final decision, handed  down December 18, 1913, found in Lowe&rsquo;s favor and levied treble damages  against the Hatters&rsquo; union. Furthermore, the court declared the assets of  union members sizable. This ruling severely restricted the ability of unions to  boycott, one of their most powerful economic weapons. The only boycott&rsquo;s that  remained legal effected only intrastate trade. </p>
   <p>At the Timberworkers&rsquo; annual convention on January 12, 1914, in  Aberdeen a unanimous roll call vote decided to "subordinate every other  thing to the one demand for an eight-hour day and to make the demand the first  of May." A strike was to be called May 1, 1914, if their demands were not  met. However, over half of the locals did not send a delegate to the convention  and the motion was not subjected to a referendum vote of the individual locals  for validation. The Timberworkers had made "splendid progress made in  organizing the timber workers" the previous year which perhaps encouraged  the Executive Board&rsquo;s belief that employers would readily grant the eight hour  day. Furthermore, the granting of the eight hour day seemed so probable that the  Timberworkers made few strike preparations. They were terribly mistaken.  Employers fought bitterly. Some succeeded in opening their mills on an  "open shop" basis. Several locals asked the Executive Board to submit  the strike motion to a referendum vote; the board declined. Instead they decided  to withdraw the strike threat and focus on achieving the eight hour day at the  polls. However, lumbermen fought the ballot initiative just as vigorously. The  political disenfranchisement of most camp workers was an additional benefit to  employers and an element in the failure of the initiative. Timberworker locals,  perhaps erroneously, felt betrayed by, and disappointed in, the Executive Board  and its cavalier attitude. </p>
   <p>The Ballard strike was not the only strike in which the IUT engaged. By  the end of 1914 the Timberworkers had engaged in 55 strikes and lockouts. With  many of its members on strike, few could contribute to the general strike fund,  thus decreasing the IUT&rsquo;s ability to continue striking. Membership began to  decline: by the beginning of 1915 the IUT had only 617 members. </p>
   <p>The failure of the Timberworkers strikes seems to be a consequence of the  convictions of lumbermen. The elite&rsquo;s of the Northwestern timber industry sere  especially antithetical to the concerns of labor. Lumbering we an aggressive  industry, the lumbermen equally aggressive. Vitally concerned with profits  lumbermen&rsquo;s labor policies were myopic, nearly malevolent. Timber magnates  were also vindictive. Employers coddled workers when the labor market favored  workers but when employers were again in power they &lsquo;settled the score.&rsquo;  Lumbermen often did not share workers&rsquo; views of working conditions; indeed,  many considered them nearly ideal. Furthermore, even though the IWW was  considered a radical organization perhaps employed bye the Imperial German  government, lumbermen "showed as little love for the "patriotic"  AFL as for the "subversive" IWW" and refused to bargain with  either. Lumbermen feared that responding to workers&rsquo; demands would undermine  the belief that mill owners were superior to workers. These attitudes help  explain why lumber unions&rsquo; efforts to improve working conditions were largely  ineffective. Indeed, it was not until the military intervened in late 1917 that  substantive improvements were made in the working lives of timber workers.  Although lumber unions were not able to accomplish much in the way of reforms,  they succeeded to a certain extent in organizing laborers. </p>
   <p>However, the initial success of the Timberworkers in organizing lumber  workers seems to have given the union&rsquo;s leadership the wrong impression.  Although the workers were eager to organize they did not want to be ruled.  Furthermore, the leaders completely misjudged the ability and intent of  employers to hold out against granting the eight hour day. From the complete  failure of nearly all the strikes, and the disastrous trends in membership, the  AFL concluded the IUT had not sufficiently organized the lumber industry and  revoked its charter in the fall of 1915. The International Shingle Weavers Union  of America was re-chartered according to the proviso in the application, thus  leaving the remaining IUT locals stranded. The International Union of  Timberworkers was effectively non-existent. </p>
   <p>The few remaining locals, however, did not yield. Shortly after the  secession of the shingle weavers they began organizing together and, late in  1916, rebuilt the IUT without the shingle weavers. In January 1917, the new IUT  was strong enough to hold a convention in Aberdeen, Washington; by spring, the  Washington State Federation of Labor again endorsed the IUT and shortly  thereafter it was again chartered by the AF of L. </p>
   <p>The new International Union of Timberworkers does not seem to have  engaged in many job actions but rather focused on stabilization and  organization. Most of the original officers left with the Shingle Weavers: J.G.  Brown was now president of the IUSWA; Ernest Marsh, past vice president, became  the president of the Washington State Federation of Labor. EE Weiland was the  new president of the Timberworkers; the vice president, Harry Call. Both of  these men spoke often at locals and public meetings to increase membership.  Again organizing efforts paid off resulting in approximately 2,000 members. </p>
   <p>Prices in the lumber market also improved in 1916 and early 1917. So much  so that the AFL unions, primarily the IUT and the International Union of Shingle  Weavers of America, felt that it was time to demand the eight hour day in the  lumber industry although neither of these unions arrived at this decision  easily. The Shingle Weavers 1906 strike for the eight hour day left them badly  crippled; the Timberworkers last attempt all but destroyed them. The Shingle  Weavers convention in May 1917, voted for an immediate strike if their demand  for an eight hour day was not met. Vice President Ernest Marsh of the State  Labor Council intervened and postponed the strike. In June Marsh was able to  persuade the union not to strike until July 16. The IUT met in convention on  July 6 and voted to strike on the 16th if their demands were neglected. The  ultimatums of the IUT were, however, different from those of the IUSWA. Whereas  the IUSWA focused on the eight hour day, the IUT desired an eight hour day in  the mills, nine in the camps, as well as union recognition, better sanitary  conditions, and a minimum wage. As strike plans were laid, the Industrial  Workers of the World began to take notice. </p>
   <p>The IWW was the preeminent lumber union in the eastern Cascades.  Membership estimates of the IWW affiliated Lumber Workers Industrial Union No.  500 in 1917 raged from 6,000 to 10,000. Although aware of the Timberworkers and  Shingle Weavers&rsquo; strike plans the IWW did not intend to cooperate with the AFL  unions. The IWW thought the AFL unions were trying to discredit them or lure the  IWW into an inopportune strike to destroy them. The IWW claimed that they did  not wish to strike at all but were "forced to come out on strike thru the  action [sic] of J.G. Brown, Ernest Marsh and Sam Gompers." The IWW sent out  word not to strike. When, on July 14, the IWW realized the amount of enthusiasm  for a strike in the camps and mills they reversed their decision and walked out.  Two days later the AFL unions also walked out, but they did not collaborate with  the IWW. Although many camps contained both IWW and AFL men the unions were not  partners, only co-belligerents. </p>
   <p>As timber production faltered then died, federal and state governments  became more and more alarmed. The war created an increased demand for timber  that was not being met. Lumber was a necessary component in ship and aircraft  building -- both vital to the war effort. The government first tried patriotism  to persuade the striking timber men to go back to work. They also pleaded with  employers to make just concessions. The IWW, however, was treated with less far  less courtesy. The government launched a fierce campaign against the IWW that,  on the whole, ignored civil liberties and due process. </p>
   <p>The campaign against the IWW was not the only involvement of the federal  government in labor relations during the war. As the United States prepared for  war the government initiated several measures designed to insure adequate  production of war supplies. Some of these reforms, however, were not much more  than elaborate &lsquo;shell games.&rsquo; The Clayton Act of 1914, for example, promised  to protect farmers&rsquo; organizations and unions from persecution under the  antitrust law but did not provide much substance as Congress would not tolerate  anything considered class legislation. This act passed political responsibility  to the staunchly anti-labor courts who referred labor back to Congress again.  The July 1915 recommendations of the left leaning United States Commission on  Industrial Relations were of equal value to labor. Comprised of representatives  from capital, labor, and the public the CIR conducted hearings on industrial  violence and other issues of concern to all. Although the Commission recommended  a very ambitious program of labor and welfare reform, little was to come of it  because of the loftiness of its goals and a tripartite split within the  Commission. However, not every federal maneuver proved ineffectual. The 1916  Keating-Owens Act outlawed child labor and President Wilson appointed Louis  Brandeis, a social and legal reformer, to the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the  Cantonment Adjustment Commission legislated against the closed nonunion shop in  War Department cantonment construction sites on July 27, 1917. This was extended  to include air fields on August 8 and all War Department construction jobs on  December 28. The National War Labor Board, though, was responsible for many of  labor&rsquo;s gains during the war. As a tripartite body established in April 1918  to "devise and implement labor policies for all war related  industries" the NWLB served as "the final court of appeal" in  labor disputes. Although President Wilson weakened the NWLB by limiting it to  sectors of the economy in which there was not already a tripartite labor board,  the NWLB made the right to unionize practicable and required employers to  bargain collectively. While Washington was addressing problems in other areas of  the economy, the War and Labor Departments were looking into the timber industry  in the Northwest. Despite their best attempts to secure equitable reforms to  stabilize production little was attained. In August 1917, Secretary of Labor  Wilson asserted: "I know of nothing further that we can do in this mater,  as everything that this Department can do is being done to secure and  adjustment." </p>
   <p>However, not everyone involved was as intransigent as it might seem. The  AFL unions, to the dismay of the IWW, made individual agreements with mills and  camps. This succeeded in re-opening a few operations, but most employers  obstinately rejected the eight hour day. The Washington State Council of Defense  intervened and arranged a meeting between the AFL unions and lumber barons on  August 13. At this meeting the AFL unions were more than generous in their  offers of conciliation: they proposed to drop all other demands if the eight  hour day were accepted and work ten hour days on government contracts without  overtime compensation. Even though the AFL unions were willing to relinquish  union recognition and all other demands as long as the eight hour day was  granted, only 160 mills re-opened on the eight hour day before the end of the  strike. The lumber barons claimed that a move to the eight hour day would ruin  the industry in the Northwest because the southern and Great Lakes lumber  industries were still on the ten hour day and did not have to contend with the  long haul to market. However, with the steadily increasing demand for, and price  of, lumber, it seems that the timber magnates were resisting on ideological  grounds as much as anything else. </p>
   <p>As the summer of 1917 wore on an equitable solution to the strike became  increasingly less likely. In September, three months into the strike, the IWW  voted to take the strike to the job: return to work but only work eight hours.  If absolutely necessary to work ten, the IWW advised its members to work so  slowly that only eight hours of work were done anyway. Suddenly the foremen  found that what used to be skilled workers had become lazy fools leaves.  Although this tactic served the IWW well, it did not place them in any better  stead with the lumber barons. In fact, the IWW was left out of most negotiations  and meetings. The IWW&rsquo;s strategy did not favor the AFL unions either. With  even doltish crews, mills and camps could produce some timber, thus allowing the  operators to preserve their position. In late summer, as more and more men were  reluctantly returning to work, E.E. Weiland recognized the inability of many of  the unions&rsquo; members to maintain the strike. Unlike the wobbly  &lsquo;bindle-stiff,&rsquo; many of the AFL men worked in town sawmills and had families  to feed. With this in mind, Weiland announced that the union&rsquo;s would not  hinder any man who felt it necessary to return to work. For a short while he  maintained that the strike was still formally in effect. </p>
   <p>The combined efforts of the AFL and the IWW shut down "ninety  percent of the logging and milling operations in western Washington." This  was undeniably the largest labor action in the lumber industry to date, and the  biggest failure. As such it brought much attention to the plight of loggers and  mill workers. One man, however, was already becoming aware of their situation  and had decided to make a difference. </p>
   <p>Raymond Ransom Canterbury was born on his family&rsquo;s traditional  mid-sized farm in Otter Creek, Iowa, in 1885. Like many young men of his era  Raymond struck out on his own, leaving the failing family farm behind. His  father&rsquo;s farm, like many other farms in the United States, was failing due to  a lack of financial resources to buy the new farming technology. Like many  Americans, Raymond believed that his fate was in his own hands and his  individualistic philosophy, as with much of America, fueled a desire for  economic improvement. Presumably the dropping prices and over production of food  was part of the reason that there was no longer room for Raymond on the family  farm. He decided to leave Iowa and make of his life what he could. He made his  way to the Northwest. </p>
   <p>Raymond had the advantage of parents who valued education. Having  completed the eighth grade, Ray acquired a grade school teaching position with  the Crook county, Oregon, school district. He taught school from 1914 through  1916, making from 50 dollars per month in 1914 to 75 in 1916. This low pay  forced Ray to look for work elsewhere. Shortly after leaving his teaching job,  the Brooks-Scanlon lumber company in Bend, Oregon, hired him as a secretary. As  a secretary Ray dealt with much of the company&rsquo;s records every day. This is  where he first became aware of the situation of the timber workers. Ray&rsquo;s  convictions about justice required him to do something so Ray began trying to  organize workers. The management of the company summarily fired Ray and three of  his contemporaries for taking part in a union organizing meeting. Incensed at  the treatment of their fellow employees, about 200 men walked off their jobs on  October 22. The International Union of Timberworkers local 19, Bend, Oregon,  became official on October 23. Local 19 held its first meeting on October 24,  1917. During this meeting Raymond Canterbury was elected president of the new  local. </p>
   <p>Mere days before Ray&rsquo;s scuffle with the Brooks-Scanlon mill, Brice  Disque arrived in Seattle. Both of these men were to be important figures in the  lumber and labor game in the Northwest, although Disque&rsquo;s legacy would far  outlast Canterbury&rsquo;s. </p>
   <p>Colonel Disque&rsquo;s arrival in Seattle on October 10, 1917, created quite  a stir in the industry. He was sent in response to the alarming lack of  production of woods vital to the war effort, especially the spruce necessary for  airplane production. A re-instated colonel in the Signal Division Corps, he met  with several key figure within an hour of disembarking from the train: Henry  Suzzallo, governor and president of the State council of Defense; James Scherer,  a highly esteemed Progressive economist; Major H.W. Tornwy, an Inspecting  Officer in the Signal Corps; and Carleton Parker, a Progressive reformer who was  to have a significant affect on Disque&rsquo;s opinions of organized labor. The  timing of Disque&rsquo;s arrival was fortuitous; the rapidly shortening days and  frequent rain and snow storms had made the eight hour issue moot, at least for a  few weeks. Even discounting the &lsquo;strike on the job&rsquo; being waged by the IWW,  and supported by the AFL and unaffiliated workers, it was difficult to work even  eight hours. This state of affairs gave Disque and his cohorts much needed time  to devise a plan to increase timber production to acceptable levels. </p>
   <p>The plan implemented was not Disque&rsquo;s idea. At a meeting between Disque  and 12-15 lumber barons, one is purported to have suggested forming a &lsquo;loyal  legion&rsquo; to "line up the workers behind the Government program."  Disque possessed the federal backing and confidence that was required to  implement such an organization. He broached this idea to his superiors upon his  return to Washington two weeks later. They responded quite favorably and sent  Disque back with definite orders to get the needed lumber. The first local of  the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen was organized in Wheeler, Oregon on  October 30, 1917. Several more locals were established in short order: by  January 1, the Legion had 10,000 members; by January 24, 35,000. </p>
   <p>The Legion, as implied by the name, was an association of workers and  employers. Whenever the employers and workers of a single camp or mill joined  they constituted a local. Employers and workers paid equal dues and were  intended to have equal power in the decision making process through delegates to  a central arbitration body of twelve members. Strikes were strictly prohibited.  The primary purpose of the Legion was to increase timber output but several  items were seen as hindrances therefore the Legion therefore made specific  demands of employers including the eight hour day, bedding linens (to be changed  at least weekly), recreational facilities, and drying rooms for clothes.  Although the eight hour issue was a sticking point, the military and federal  backing of the Legion, as well as Disque&rsquo;s threats, persuaded lumbermen to  acquiesce. </p>
   <p>Although timber moguls and the government favored the Four L&rsquo;s, as they  were called, workers were considerably less enthusiastic even though Legion  membership did not preclude AFL membership. The Four L&rsquo;s continued the  patriotic theme of coercion, demanding that workers sign a pledge that read, in  part, "I will do every act and thing which will in general aid in carrying  this war to a successful conclusion." The patriotic pontificating of Legion  organizers was merely a candy coating -- Legion membership was mandatory to  work. Because many workers would only sullenly submit to the wheedling of Legion  organizers the Four L&rsquo;s resorted to violence to procure new members.  Timberworkers and Wobblies complained of being threatened with forceful,  airborne ejection from the speeding train they were riding if they declined to  sign. Beatings of recalcitrant union members were also not uncommon. </p>
   <p>The Timberworkers had other reasons for disliking the Four L&rsquo;s.  Ironically, the IUT hated the Four L&rsquo;s for much the same reason the IWW hated  the IUT: each thought the other was simply a tool of capitalists, not an  authentic workers&rsquo; union. The Timberworkers, however, did not usually couch  their criticisms in such language declaring that the Legion was "a  prostituted, boss-controlled organization of employers and company  suckers." The IUT&rsquo;s opinion of the IWW was not any more favorable.  According to the IUT the IWW was "a menace to the government of this  country and is opposed to the American Federation of Labor for its belief in the  government, and because of these facts, the Timber Workers  Uunion, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, is opposed to  the I.W.W." </p>
   <p>IWW&rsquo;s were "worse than scabs." In turn Disque equated Timberworker  membership with "disloyalty to the nation." The IUT also felt that the  Four L&rsquo;s were actively attempting to destroy them. This was not true, at least  in the beginning. Disque had "no personal objection to organized  labor" but felt that the Timberworkers and the Shingle Weavers withhold  form any attempt at organization in the lumber industry as it would be  detrimental to the war effort and personally damaging to his reputation. This he  communicated to Gompers in hopes that he would restrain the activities of AFL  unions and organizers. Disque also told Gompers that the legion was a wartime  organization, that after the war "the Loyal Legion will have spent its  usefulness and it will be necessary then that some kind of organization replace  it." Although Gompers does not appear to have entered into an explicit  agreement with Disque he nonetheless encouraged AFL unions to withhold form  organizing. The Timberworkers, still weak from the 1917 lumber strike, were  angered by Gompers&rsquo; lack of official support for the Timberworkers&rsquo; struggle  against the Four L&rsquo;s. </p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, one element of the IUT&rsquo;s loathing of the Four L&rsquo;s was  their ability to achieve the eight hour day. Whereas the Legion accomplished  this feat within five months of its founding, the IUT had twice almost been  destroyed by its attempts at the eight hour day. The Four L&rsquo;s, though, did not  have to contend with the same obstacles as the IUT. Disque had become quite  popular in Washington and was given near absolute authority to do what was  necessary to improve production. To resolve the eight hour issue he brought the  full force of federal power to bear on the operators. Disque threatened to  commandeer lands, mills, or whatever else he deemed necessary for timber  production. Concurrently, Senator George Chamberlain of Oregon was pushing a  bill through congress that would indirectly give Disque such power. Reluctantly  the lumbermen conceded. The eight hour day was established in the lumber  industry on March 1, 1918. </p>
   <p>Brice Disque was easily swayed by those whom the thought his betters. One  element that contributed to Disque&rsquo;s reevaluation of organized labor was a  change of mentors. Initially Carleton Parker took Disque under his wing. Parker  was a progressive reformer who did much to convince Disque of the moral and  practical benefits of organized labor. His later guru, Charles Van Hemert,  detested labor organizations as socialistic and unpatriotic at best.  Consequently Disque also became inclined to dislike unions. Although each of  these men exerted considerable influence on Disque, Van Hemert&rsquo;s bias won out  in the end. </p>
   <p>The relationship between Samuel Gompers and Brice Disque bean when the  initial proposal for the Four L&rsquo;s was submitted to Sam Gompers for his  approval. Gompers endorsed the plan and he and Disque kept in close contact over  it. However, this amicable relationship did not last. It appears the initial  overt split between these two resulted from a widely read letter Gompers wrote  to W.D. Clark, secretary of the Timberworkers local in Couer d&rsquo;Alene, Idaho,  on May 21, 1918, in which Gompers stated that the establishment of the eight  hour day "was the achievement of the American Federation of Labor, and no  little credit is due to the International Union of Timberworkers." Disque,  denied his rightful glory, began to detest Gompers, the AFL and, through them,  the IUT. </p>
   <p>Colonel Disque&rsquo;s personality was readily apparent in the Four L&rsquo;s  from the beginning so it is not surprising that this fallout with Gompers and  change of mentors had important ramifications. He was a selfish, power-hungry  man who strove to concentrate power in his hands alone. During the formative  stages of the Four L&rsquo;s, Disque worked to insure he would be the sole  commander. The effect of this can be seen in the Legion organizational  structure. Locals were limited to a single secretary who was invariably  appointed by Disque. Also, the grievance procedure ended with Disque who had  reserved the right of final arbiter. Disque allowed his personal distaste for  Gompers to radically influence Legion policy: shortly after his May split with  Gompers, Disque told Legion officers that any Legionnaire who "spoke  against the Four L effort ... was to lose his Legion card and his job. However,  Disque did not stop there; AFL meeting halls were attacked by Legion officers.  The excessively brutal Captain E.D. Birkholz leading SPD troopers and  Legionnaires wielding 2 x 4&rsquo;s and pick handles, broke up a Timberworkers&rsquo;  organizing meeting that was being held outside a Legion camp. According to the  account by Idaho Federationists, the captain said: "I am an Army  officer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I have come  here to disband this union and by God I am going to do it."&nbsp; Birkholz  was never punished for his zeal. By mid 1918 Disque had ordered that any Legion  local in which too many members joined the Timberworkers, or any AFL union, have  their charter revoked and the errant members expelled. </p>
   <p>The Timberworkers did not intend to sit still while its members were  beaten and its meetings violently disrupted. However, Disque&rsquo;s wartime  constraints crippled the IUT thus they were not nearly as strong, well armed, or  protected as the Legion and, as such, could not return the favors in kind.  Therefore they took the offensive in newspapers and meetings. Although public  attacks on the Legion during the war years were generally restrained, a  resolution to be forwarded to President Wilson, Secretary of War Baker, Sam  Gompers, and the public press, openly accused Disque of being a liar. A second  resolution, forwarded to all above except the President, compared Disque with  the German Kaiser and declared that membership in the Legion interfered with  civil rights and that the Legion was an autocratic organization which denied  democracy to the citizens of America. For the most part, though, the IUT  restricted its denouncements of the Legion to more subtle proclamations. The  Timberworkers also arranged numerous debates between representatives of the  Legion and the Timberworkers. Quite often Ray Canterbury, now International  Secretary and general organizer, was chosen to speak for the IUT. Reports of  these events in labor newspapers typically sided with the Timberworkers. It  seems, though, that Ray kept at tight reign on his temper, never lambasting the  Legion enough to incur retribution. Indeed, in March 1918 Ray is reported to  have said "we have the utmost confidence in Colonel Disque. We found him a  man fair to all parties concerned, and one who is sure to make a great success  in the office he now holds." However, this facade would not last. After the  war Ray described Disque as "crooked" and "treacherous," the  Legion as a "rotten bunch." </p>
   <p>In March 1918, the Shingle Weavers and Timberworkers amalgamated under  the name of the latter. The Shingle Weavers had suffered badly from Disque&rsquo;s  anti-AFL policies adding only 206 members to the Timberworkers&rsquo; 2,324. In June  of 1918 the new Timberworkers began an intensive organizational campaign in  Legion camps. Were it not for Disque and the Legion this campaign could have  been quite successful. The demands of the war created a labor market with a  paltry unemployment rate of 1.4 percent in 1918 thus markedly favoring workers.  Furthermore, the use of employer groups to suppress unionization left workers  distrustful of such organizations and, hence, more likely to join a legitimate  union. However, Disque, still irate over the letter from Gompers he had received  less than a week prior, retaliated by utilizing his political power and  influence. Law men harassed AFL organizers and the draft status of Timberworkers  received special attention. Luckily, Raymond Canterbury was exempt from the  draft for medical reasons. </p>
   <p>After the was the IUT and Ray let loose their full hatred of the Legion  in the press and in meeting halls throughout the Northwest. Ray wrote  innumerable vituperative articles for several newspapers. He toured the country  incessantly, speaking and organizing wherever he went. He was a fiery speaker,  utterly wound up in his cause. Ray also had a reputation for complete honesty  and impeccable integrity. Considering Ray&rsquo;s personality and his incredible  organizational and leadership skills it is small wonder that he was promoted  often, attaining the International Presidency in 1921. Throughout his career he  never let up on the Legion. The Timberworkers also continued attacking Disque  after he left the Legion. The continuation of the Legion after the war became a  constant source of discontent and ammunition for published polemics. </p>
   <p>Disque had offered to disband the Legion after the war if Gompers would  restrict the organizational activities of AFL unions in the Northwest. Gompers  does not appear to have explicitly agreed to this, although he did, initially,  curb AFL activities. Nevertheless, the hatred Disque developed for the AFL would  not allow him to let the Four L&rsquo;s exit quietly. Instead of directly disbanding  the Legion, Disque convened a meeting of Legion secretaries and members wherein  it was unanimously decided to continue the Legion after the war. Recall that  Legion officers were almost invariably appointed by Disque. Furthermore, at the  first Legion convention after the war only fifteen or twenty delegates  represented workers and negative votes on resolutions were not counted. Whether  or not workers wanted to continue the Legion is a matter of some debate. Workers  in Bend, Oregon, "voted to drop it for good." At the Brooks-Scanlon  Lumber Company, the starting place of Ray Canterbury&rsquo;s union activities, five  people voted to keep the Legion -- all foremen. Moreover, membership after the  armistice abruptly plummeted, from 79,591 to an average membership in 1919 of  16,703. Membership increased slightly in 1920 before leveling off at just over  10,000 for the remainder of the 1920&rsquo;s. Most of these members were in mills,  the Legion being very weak in the camps. It is perhaps the accomplishments to  the Legion that convinced many workers that it was more a workers&rsquo; union than  a company union that lead so many to sustain Legion membership. </p>
   <p>The Timberworkers more than tripled their membership in 1919, thought  most of these additions were in the Great Lakes area. They remained relatively  weak in the Northwest claiming only 1, 923 members in 42 locals. Although most  of the Northwestern locals had less than 100 dollars in their general fund&rsquo;s,  the locals Everett, McKenna, Aberdeen, Yakima, and Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, Idaho, all  had significantly more. The most powerful locals were Bellingham and Bend,  Oregon. The Timberworkers surrendered six charters during fiscal 1918 but issued  55, six of which were "colored." The IUT continued to be optimistic  about their efforts. By June of 1920 the IUT had 15, 759 members. It seems that  their continuous assault on the Four L&rsquo;s convinced quite a few workers of the  benefits of a workers&rsquo; union. The Timberworkers used this increase in power  wisely, winning several small strikes during the first years after the war, as  well as the much larger strike for the eight hour day in the Great Lakes region.  These strikes were not easily won though as employers relentlessly attacked the  Timberworkers with propaganda and even espionage. </p>
   <p>The Bellingham strike was by far the most important action taken by the  Timberworkers in 1920. The Bloedel Donovan Company discharged the Timberworker  shop stewards from its plant on July 19 incurring a massive strike. The company  refused to negotiate with the union or re-hire the strike leaders; rather they  established a company union to counteract the influence of the IUT. The IUT  claimed that that IWW and the Four L&rsquo;s scabbed on them though it seems that Wobblies  and Legionnaires waited till the strike was nearly broken before working. This  proved to be a turning point for the Timberworkers. Membership began to decline:  in July they were down to 12,317 members; by August only 4, 614 remained. The  deterioration in membership continued at an average rate of 500 per month for  the rest of the year. At this time the Timberworkers were focusing their efforts  on the Great Lakes timber areas and, possibly because of continued wariness of  the Four L&rsquo;s, neglected the Northwest. </p>
   <p>The Timberworkers continued struggle for survival did not allow them to  pursue many of their other aims. Although the repeated declines membership and  finances lead to caution in Timberworker officers, their ideas did not waiver.  The preamble to the IUT constitution and by-laws proclaims the intent of the  Timberworkers was, in part, "to cultivate the social and fraternal ties  existing among the workers in the timber industry." This kind of idealism  is seen again in 1919 when the IUT resolved to "use its best effort"  to secure health insurance legislation for which the worker would "not be  compelled to pay any part." However, with membership plummeting, their  efforts to achieve such legislation were merely tokens. </p>
   <p>It seems, though, that they were somewhat successful in promoting  fraternity among timber workers. Among the IUT&rsquo;s social activities was a circa  1920 banquet of 500 at which Vice President Ray Canterbury addressed the  assembled to their great pleasure. The Timberworkers of Bend, Oregon, arranged a  dance and auction event in honor of Canterbury to raise funds for the union. The  event was a great success netting over 600 dollars. One man, A.H. Horn, wrapped  a brick and a $1 check in a package labeled "[n]o one ever lost anything by  buying brick." The Bend local also provided for some of the more practical  needs of members. The headquarters contained a two chair barbershop and a  tobacco and confectionery shop as well as club rooms "to furnish a place of  amusement as well as a gathering place for the members and their friends." </p>
   <p>However, fraternity itself was not sufficient. The lumber depression of  1921 resulted in appalling unemployment rates which were reflected in  Timberworker membership. The depression had an altogether unforeseen consequence  as well. The Timberworkers kept their treasury primarily in the  Scandinavian-American bank so when the bank bankrupted the Timberworkers&rsquo;  funds were lost. In June of 1921 the AFL, dismayed at the state of organization  in the industry and the plight of the IUT, resolved to "render all possible  assistance" to the Timberworkers that they might organize enough workers to  maintain themselves as a union. A principal reason for this aid was to keep Ray  Canterbury, International President in the field as an organizer. This  assistance, however, was not sufficient but the officers of the IUT, already  grateful for all the AFL had done for them, would not ask for more. C.O.  "Dad" Young, Gompers&rsquo; representative in the area, requested further  financial aid from Gompers in November stating that if support was not received  the Timberworkers might, of necessity, "close their doors." </p>
   <p>Although AFL assistance kept the doors of the IUT open, it did not  significantly alter the state of affairs. Membership continued to decline but  the Timberworkers refused to admit defeat. When, on February 24, 1922, the mills  at Klamath Falls notified their employees that as of March 1 they would be  returning to nine hour days, ten in the valley, the workers struck. There was  only a small local of the IUT in Klamath which most workers joined to better  organize the strike. The upsurge in union membership had little effect; the  strike was lost. In June the IUT permitted its members to return to work but  refused to call off the strike, fearing that doing so would be a tacit  endorsement of the longer days. </p>
   <p>As 1922 ended, the Timberworkers&rsquo; situation degenerated. The officers  of the IUT had to pay whatever bills there were from their own pockets. By  February of 1923 the IUT was inquiring of the AFL what was necessary for them to  surrender their charter. The AFL responded by requesting that the officers of  the IUT keep their positions without pay or at least maintain contact with the  few remaining locals so that they might revive the union when conditions  permitted. This was not to happen. By the end of March 1923 the Timberworkers  had closed all their offices. Raymond Canterbury resigned from the International  Union of Timberworkers April 1, 1923. </p>
   <p>After the dissolution of the IUT Raymond resurrected the Rainier Valley  Herald newspaper. He did not continue in union organization because he was tired  of the petty politicking and Sam Gompers&rsquo; conciliatory, exclusionist policies.  Gompers&rsquo; restraint of the IUT during the war and his "lack of support for  the Timberworkers&rsquo; crusade against Disque" also ate at Ray. Maxwell  Canterbury, Raymond&rsquo;s eldest son, recalls that the failure of the IUT crushed  Raymond. After so many years of sacrifice, personal, political, and financial,  the inability of the IUT to survive or achieve many tangible gains was too much  to bear. Ray had spent so much time away from home on union business that his  eldest son has only one childhood memory of playing with him. Raymond&rsquo;s  financial commitment to the IUT caused his son to consider him a foolish, albeit  dedicated man. Economic hardship became the Canterbury&rsquo;s constant companion  causing Max to get his first job at 12 to help. After Ray left the union Max  lent his father money so he could get this possessions out of hawk. Only  recently has Max begun to revise his opinion of his father. Ray was also in  declining health; he had a disease that slowly dissolved his bones. By the mid  1930&rsquo;s he could no longer even throw a ball. </p>
   <p>Ray&rsquo;s post union life was not, however a complete failure. He became a  real estate agent in 1928 where he specialized in bringing together people who  were likely to do business. Usually he worked for trade, his commission being a  car, food, or some other non-monetary compensation. Out of one of these  arrangements Ray acquired a good deal of property on Quilcene Bay. Here Ray  started the Canterbury Oyster Farm that still exists today although industrial  pollutants have contaminated the oysters. </p>
   <p>From the Timberworkers inception to their demise they struggled to  survive. No matter how hard they tried exigencies known and unforeseen did not  permit their success or existence. AFL ideologies and the isolation of workers  made simple formation laborious and unsure. Once instituted the IUT found itself  in an environment inimical to unions through judicial rulings and self centered  employers. Brice Disque&rsquo;s personal antipathy towards Samuel Gompers lead to  severe repression and harassment of the Timberworkers through the Loyal Legion.  Legion practices during the war weakened the IUT so much that even the  membership surge of 1919 was not sustained. Continued wariness of the Legion  lead to the Timberworkers neglect of the Northwest and thus, their inability to  survive the depression of 1921. Raymond Canterbury&rsquo;s involvement, thought  dedicated, was not enough to overcome ineffectual federal legislation or the  legacy of Legion attacks. This legacy in combination with the 1921 depression  spelled the end of the Timberworkers. Raymond&rsquo;s post-union search for a career  elucidates his absolute commitment to, and his emotional investment in, the  International Union of Timberworkers.</p>
