   <p>The Seattle General Strike grew out of a strike  in the shipyards that began in January 1919 when 35,000 workers walked off the job demanding a wage increase that federal officials had promised would be theirs at the end of World War I. This article explores the background to that strike, describing the shipyards that employed tens of thousands during the war, examining the working and living conditions of workers in overcrowded Seattle, and detailing the union negotiations that preceded the walkout. Separate from the article, here is  is a <a href="shipyards_news.shtml">database of 142 digitized newspaper articles</a> about the shipyards during 1918.</p>

   While the city lay dormant, the mayor, city officials, union leaders and   Henry Suzzallo worked day and night to find solution to the strike.     Henry Suzzallo, however was not a city official or a labor leader. He was  the President of the University of Washington, a president whose connections to  state and federal leaders resulted in appointments to positions of more power and prestige. Governor Lister had landed him the powerful job of Director of the State Council of Defense during the war and bizarrely enough asked Suzzallo to fill his position as he lay dying during the strike.</div>

    <p>The story of IWW &quot;songbird&quot; Katie Phar, a 10-year-old Spokane girl, and her correspondence with Wobbly martyr and songwriter, Joe Hill, brings to life the powerful synthesis of music and organizing that the IWW employed in the years before World War I when the radical organization was becoming influential in the Pacific Northwest. </p>

    <p>Edward W.

He was also a spy who sent daily reports to the leadership of Associated Industries, an employer group that led the campaign to defeat organized labor in the wake of the General Strike. This report uncovers the spies, explores their methods, and assesses their impact. </p>

   Anna Louise Strong begins her autobiography <em>I Change Worlds</em> with a story about herself as a  little girl wandering through a garden and realizing, for the first time in her  short life, the powerful sensation of loneliness. For the grown woman writing  her memoirs in 1935 this epiphany symbolized Anna Louise's steadfast, life-long  dedication to a Socialist ideal that united all human beings in peace. </div>

   To many of the locals in Seattle the strike was the  beginning of an attempted revolution by the Industrial Workers of the World and  others with similar radical tendencies. The  insistence of these conservatives that the IWW was behind the strike, together  with the state of the organization and its place in the labor movement at the  time, has created a mystery as to just how much of a role the  &ldquo;Wobblies&rdquo; played in the Seattle General Strike.  </div>

  In relation to the African  American community, the labor movement was anything but radical. Seattle  unions were often racist and excluded Blacks from their ranks. At other times  they voiced support for Blacks, but in actuality they did little to erase the  color bar in unions. African Americans experiencing these racist attitudes developed an ambiguous relationship with labor, with some supporting and others opposing labor unions.

  For two decades, between 1901 and 1921, the International Shingle Weavers&rsquo;  Union was one of the largest, most powerful unions in the Pacific Northwest. It  set the standard for the other unions of the day or yet to come. Historian,  Norman H. Clark described the Shingle Weavers&rsquo; as, &ldquo;The most militant and  articulate representatives on the Trade Council were the shingle weavers, whose  union was by far the largest and strongest.&rdquo; Every labor union in the state  if not in the nation has benefited from the Weavers&rsquo; existence.</div>

   Women have always participated in the labor movement of the Pacific Northwest, the type and extent of their participation was the key question asked about women's involvement in the labor movement. Although women have played many roles in the movement, the most long-standing and persistent role that women had was that of supporter of their union husbands.   Many women workers learned how organization could increase their chances of  successfully negotiating with employers for fairer wages and better working  conditions.</div>

  Several newspapers were in support of labor making certain advances.  However, the Seattle General Strike was viewed to be something more. Labor was  aiming to shut an entire city down and maybe even more. Some newspapers began to  publish paranoia articles  and to imply  that the unions were pushing for a &lsquo;Bolshevik Revolution&rsquo;. These newspapers  played on people&rsquo;s fear of losing their democracy even though that wasn&rsquo;t  really the case. </div>

     <a href="williams.shtml"><img src="images/olehanson2-thumb.jpg" alt="Ole Hansen" width="250" height="167" border="0"></a></div>
  Ole Hanson was Mayor of Seattle in 1919 when the Seattle Central Labor Council led local unions on a general strike that shut down the city for three days. When the strike ended promptly and peacefully, regional and national newspapers gave Mayor Hanson full credit for its conclusion, launching him on a short whirlwind of national celebrity. Because newspapers and he himself exaggerated his importance  in ending the strike, and because at the moment of his prominence the public was  looking for a man of his supposed qualities, Ole Hanson became an over-large  target for near-fanatic praise from people all over the country.</div>

   <p>The combination of an increased fear of a possible German invasion and a strong patriotic duty among Americans led to the creation of volunteer organizations in which citizens could show their dedication to the United States by spying on their friends, neighbors and co-workers and reporting any un-American conduct. </p>

   Establishing lumber unions was a huge task, and even the few that did exist as  part of the AFL and IWW had a hard time raising wages and improving working  conditions prior to 1917. Usually, a majority of lumber workers would not want to strike; or if they did, the lumber company did not seem to mind sacrificing a few months of labor in order to maintain the upper hand in the lumber industry. World War I was the catalyst that helped change the face of the lumber industry in the Pacific Northwest.</div>

     <a href="canterbury.shtml"><img src="images/lumberman-thumb.jpg" alt="Lumberjacks" width="250" height="108" border="0"></a></div>
The Northwest lumber industry in the early part of the 20th century was, at its  best, rugged, at its worst, brutal.   The isolation and transient lifestyle of timber workers made most of them  unable to vote. With few ties so society and an insecure economic future, these  men had little to lose. This disposed many towards unions or other forms of  protest although they were rarely successful.</div>

  On Monday April 29 1918, a local branch of the Commercial Telegraphers Union held a small meeting in Seattle, unaware of the storm of controversy and political wrangling that would follow for the next four months and the shockwaves that would bring labor in Seattle ever closer together. The story of the workers struggle against the Western Union and Postal Telegraph Companies in 1918 embodies the social and political fragility of the times and the state of labor in Seattle in the year preceding the first general strike in US history.</div>

  Sentenced  to death in 1917 for a July 1916 San Francisco parade bombing he was ultimately  cleared of, Thomas J.

  By the late afternoon of July 19, 1913 the Seattle headquarters of the Industrial Workers of the World lay in ruin.  Along with two Socialist Party offices and a Socialist newsstand, it had been looted and its contents dumped into the street and burned by a mob of locals and visiting sailors.   </div>

  Women had worked in textile industries and other industries as far back as 1880, but had been kept out of heavy industries and other positions involving any real responsibility.  Just before the war, women began to break away from the traditional roles they had played.   As men left their jobs to serve their  country in war overseas,  women replaced their jobs. </div>

  A vocal and militant anti-war movement emerged in Seattle following the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914. Based largely  in the labor and radical communities, it continued even after the US declared war in 1917 and Congress passed punitive sedition laws. This paper explains the politics of prowar and antiwar activism in Seattle and details the government crackdown on dissent, including the prosecutions that sent Hulet Wells, Louise Olivereau, Sam Sadler, and others to prison. </div>

   Press coverage of the development and implementation of Washington State&rsquo;s    1911 Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act varied significantly from newspaper to    newspaper.&nbsp; Particularly among    Seattle newspapers, amount and slant of coverage and editorial opinion seemed    to reflect the fundamental political and economic interests of the newspaper    publishers and their intended audiences.   </div>

  Women who worked in the laundries in Seattle during the World War I period worked long, hard hours and were forced to work faster to receive less pay for their work. As laundry owners increased prices, they refused to pay more and fired  women who joined unions or sought out representation.  Nevertheless, women organized into unions and when their  frustrations rose to a crescendo it culminated in a very successful strike.</div>

The  construction of race in the United States has been a long process of redefining  and reaffirming the ideas of whiteness and citizenship.  This racialized form of thinking was by no means a forgone  conclusion from the creation of our country, but was a thought process that was  created and perpetuated over hundreds of years, continuing through today.&nbsp;The process of organizing labor was certainly not immune to racialized forms of thinking.</div>
