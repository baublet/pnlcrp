   <p>Early in 1919, as World War I was grinding to a close and revolutionary  movements were sweeping Russia and Germany in the war&rsquo;s aftermath, the nation  was stunned and exhilarated by a strike in Seattle, Washington that brought the  city to a complete standstill.&nbsp; Sixty  thousand Seattle workers walked off their jobs on Thursday morning, February 6,  joining the tens of thousands of shipyard workers who had struck two weeks  earlier.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;  Before the four-day strike had run its course, the eyes of the nation had  focused on Seattle, and the search for a face to put on the event had begun in  earnest.</p>
   <p>Authorities  pointed fingers at &ldquo;anarchists and radicals in the unions,&rdquo; and ended their  search there.&nbsp; The commercial press  was similarly hostile.&nbsp; It is in the  pages of the partisan labor press, <em>The  Seattle Union Record, </em>that the human side of the event can be seen and its  history traced.&nbsp; As the official  voice of the Seattle Central Labor Council, it was also eyes and ears for  Seattle workers in the weeks leading up to the strike.&nbsp;  The paper was no small presence; the February 4, 1919 press run was  71,400 copies.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;  An opportune expansion from weekly to daily publication the previous year  was to provide not only a vital link between the trade unions, but also a rich  historical timeline of how the general strike developed.&nbsp;  The picture that emerges is that of a remarkable social solidarity  movement that traces directly, almost without interruption, back through several  months to a nationwide fight by labor to save the life of Tom Mooney.</p>
   <p>Sentenced  to death in 1917 for a July 1916 San Francisco parade bombing he was ultimately  cleared of, Thomas J. Mooney in his San Quentin death row cell became the focus  of an intense, desperate struggle by trade unionists and political leftists  nationwide to thwart the California execution.&nbsp;  Later probes of the prosecution revealed widespread corruption and  perjured testimony in the service of targeting &ldquo;anarchist troublemakers.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp;  But Mooney remained on death row in a countdown to the gallows, as the  efforts to secure a new trial were refused.&nbsp;  By November of 1918, when the U. S. Supreme Court was asked to intervene,  the plight of Tom Mooney was widely known throughout the West and in union  locals across the country.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp;  It was a union movement fired by urgency that only an unjust death  sentence could sustain.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;Even  as the date approached for the Supreme Court review of Mooney&rsquo;s appeal, huge  rallies were being held in New York and San Francisco with the demand that he be  freed and urging &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; to enforce it.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp;  The execution had been stayed by California Gov. Stephens pending State  and U.S. Supreme Court reviews, and now was scheduled for Friday, December 13.&nbsp; <em>The Seattle Union Record</em>, now a  daily newspaper with a growing readership in the community beyond the  subscribing trade unionists, covered every action taken nationwide in Mooney&rsquo;s  defense.&nbsp; When the Supreme Court  declined to hear the case on November 18, 1918, claiming lack of jurisdiction,  attention was focused on Gov. Stephens and the demand for a pardon or a new  trial.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  From this point forward,  &ldquo;Free Mooney!&rdquo; would dominate the headlines and daily coverage in <em>The  Seattle Union Record, </em>and guide the actions of the Seattle Central Labor  Council, for the next one hundred days, leading right into the heady days of the  Seattle General Strike.&nbsp; The urgency  of the Mooney campaign, and the overarching themes of working class solidarity,  internationalism, personal liberty and simple fairness that infused the Mooney  fight, flowed seamlessly into the January dispute in the Seattle shipyards that  triggered the general strike.&nbsp; Defiant  messages from the condemned prisoner were given prominent airing: &ldquo;The highest  courts of the land&hellip;have said that a corrupt district attorney can use perjured  testimony and can conceal and suppress material evidence to convict an American  citizen&hellip;and that a citizen so convicted is without remedy&hellip;.&nbsp;  Then they wonder why some workers become infected with Bolshevism.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Seattle unions wasted no  time in beginning to organize for the final countdown.&nbsp;  With less than three weeks until the scheduled execution in California,  the Seattle Central Labor Council rushed to consider the way forward.&nbsp;  By the time the council met the night of Wednesday, November 20, several  member unions had already voted &ldquo;in favor of a nation-wide strike, as a last  resort, to obtain justice for the condemned man.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Machinists&rsquo; Hope Lodge, an influential craft union within the Metal  Trades Council in Seattle&rsquo;s shipyards, had passed a resolution calling for a  national strike December 1.&nbsp; As with  nearly every subsequent strike vote by Seattle&rsquo;s unions, it passed by a large  majority.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp;  The next night the Metal Trades Council adopted the strike and sent it on  to the Seattle Central Labor Council for its Wednesday night meeting, asking  that &ldquo;action taken be centralized and universal.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>&nbsp;  After a unanimous vote, the Central Council recommended the general  strike plan to all its member unions, three days after the Supreme Court issued  its decision.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Important undercurrents of  industrial unionism moved just beneath the surface of these sympathy strike  votes.&nbsp; Coordinating actions between  local craft unions was already difficult---there were some two hundred unions in  Seattle, dozens in the shipyards---and the cumbersome nature of craft  organization in the face of real crisis was becoming painfully obvious to many  in the labor unions.&nbsp; Along with  passing the first general strike resolution, the Hope Lodge of Machinists also  called for the amalgamation of all the shipyard trades into one industrial  union.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a>&nbsp;  The argument followed that actions taken in the shipyards should be  decided by a mass vote of all shipyard workers rather than equal votes cast by  each separate union, regardless of size.&nbsp; This  move would prove decisive in the looming shipyard dispute, which shut down the  Seattle waterfront and lead to the General Strike.&nbsp;  Hampered by the American Federation of Labor leadership, but anticipating  amalgamation, the Seattle Metal Trades unions had begun to act like an  industrial union, fostering solidarity and enabling quick action.&nbsp;  Seattle unionists saw themselves in the forefront of the drive for union  amalgamation, with Kelly of the Machinists declaring: &ldquo;When constitutions are  against human rights I say to hell with constitutions.&nbsp;  I think Seattle should take the lead and show the rest of the world  we&rsquo;re really for this principle.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Seattle was hardly alone in  organizing for resistance.&nbsp; In San  Francisco, where tensions also ran high because of waterfront disputes with the  shipyards and government imposed wage scales, local unions in Oakland, San  Francisco and Alameda were voting on Mooney strike proposals, with more unions  to follow before December 1.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>&nbsp;  New York unions were preparing for industrial action on Mooney&rsquo;s  behalf; numerous demonstrations against the scheduled execution were ongoing.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a>&nbsp;  Seattle, though, had taken the lead, with more local unions voting to  strike and preparations proceeding at full speed in the Central Labor Council.&nbsp;  The &ldquo;splendid action of the Seattle trades unionists&rdquo; was duly noted  in a report from San Francisco, acknowledging that &ldquo;their prompt and decisive  action heartened the defense forces and gave wonderful impetus to the strike  movement&hellip;sweeping the nation and arousing interest even across the  Atlantic.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In the midst of this  organizing frenzy, political bombshells were exploding that intensified the  fight for Mooney&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp; Accusations  that the San Francisco prosecutor had cynically rigged testimony to frame and  convict the targeted &ldquo;radicals&rdquo; had resulted in an investigation by the U.S.  Secretary of Labor.&nbsp; The telephones  of the prosecutor were wiretapped in an elaborate undercover operation by J.B.  Densmore, Director General of Employment, producing months of incriminating  conversations by corrupt San Francisco authorities, and suggesting that  California Governor Stephens would just as soon see Mooney hanged.&nbsp; <em>The Seattle Union Record</em> crowed  that &ldquo;almost every social and political act of those who are arrayed today as  the principals in this amazing trail of guilty circumstances&hellip;has been  preserved through the medium of the dictaphone.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a>&nbsp;  Excerpts from Densmore&rsquo;s lengthy and accusatory report began showing up  in newspapers November 26, further inflaming the outrage over Mooney&rsquo;s now  &ldquo;proven&rdquo; innocence.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On November 22, the actual  trial judge in the Mooney case, Judge Franklin Griffin, who had sentenced Mooney  to be hanged, publicly called for a new trial, because of new knowledge of  perjured testimony that had been presented to convict the defendant.&nbsp;  In a letter to Gov. Stephens, Judge Griffin reviewed the entire body of  evidence and concluded that Mooney had been unjustly prosecuted and convicted.&nbsp; The judge appealed to the governor to issue a pardon and  grant a retrial.&nbsp; <em>The Seattle Union Herald,</em> for its part, demanded to know how the  governor could maintain such a cowardly silence in the face of blatant  injustice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hour is ripe,&rdquo;  the paper declared, &ldquo;for Governor Stephens to let the world know whether he is  a MAN or a POLTROON.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Across the nation, momentum  for a general strike was building.&nbsp; In  city after city local unions took near-unanimous votes in support of Mooney.&nbsp;  New York, San Francisco, Milwaukee, Detroit, all took big votes in favor  of a nation-wide general strike and began to make preparations for carrying it  out.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a>&nbsp;  British workers were concerned: A November 27th conference of  the National Labor Party, attended by 1576 delegates from 352 labor groups voted  unanimously to ask U.S. President Wilson to intervene on behalf of Tom Mooney.&nbsp;  The London Trades Council was following suit.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a>&nbsp;  Noted American writer Upton Sinclair wired the governor:</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p>If    you permit Mooney to die, you accomplish two results: First, you greatly    weaken the influence of President Wilson with labor and Socialist forces    abroad, upon which he must depend for the support of his program of    international justice; second, you make almost impossible a peaceful issue of    the impending struggle between labor and capital in America.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a></p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>&nbsp;Others  got into the act.&nbsp; The King County  Democratic Club found their own rationale for requesting conditional pardon or  retrial: &ldquo;The hanging of Tom Mooney will tend to provoke social discontent and  disorder, and to break down popular faith in the orderly processes of the  law,&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a> and sent this message to the governor.&nbsp; In  Aberdeen, Washington, the Electrical Workers of Grays Harbor printed and were  distributing circulars by the thousand, which read:&nbsp;  &ldquo;Labor has been very patient in this matter and every opportunity has  been given for justice to prevail.&nbsp; But  patience has now ceased to be a virtue, and action is our only recourse&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title="">[24]</a></p>
   <p>Not  least, the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, had been writing to  Governor Stephens imploring him to use his pardon powers to prevent the  execution.&nbsp; Wilson&rsquo;s concerns were  simple: the post-war conundrum of &ldquo;certain international affairs, which his  execution would greatly complicate.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  These letters, beginning in March 1918, were kept secret by the governor;  two weeks before the scheduled hanging, he had still not responded.</p>
   <p>In  Seattle, &ldquo;a complete tie-up&rdquo; of all industry was predicted for December 9,  the date of the general strike, and organizers foresaw a city &ldquo;engulfed in the  silence of the tomb.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a>&nbsp;  Every union in the city was in solid support save the printers.&nbsp;  James Duncan, head of the Seattle Central Labor Council, had wired to all  labor organizations in the country asking participation in the general strike.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Grim preparations&rdquo; were being made by the Central Council, providing  for fire protection, food provisions, medical treatment and policing of the  city.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a>&nbsp;  Planning was comprehensive: The public safety committee even laid plans  &ldquo;to eliminate, as far as possible, the activities of the &lsquo;blind pigs&rsquo;  where the striking men might get the stuff that would blind their reason and  encourage disorderly conduct.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a>&nbsp;  Seattle would be ready for the strike.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On Friday, November 29, Governor  Stephens abruptly announced the commutation of Mooney&rsquo;s sentence from death to  life in prison.&nbsp; In a rambling  defense of his decision and indecision, Stephens revealed the requests made by  President Wilson to avoid roiling international affairs with a needless  execution.&nbsp; In denying Mooney a  pardon or new trial Stephens argued, absurdly, &ldquo;the logic that a man is either  guilty or innocent, and that necessarily if the maximum punishment is not  justified pardon should follow does not hold either in theory or in practice.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Then, after refusing &ldquo;to recognize this case as in any fashion  representing a clash between capital and labor,&rdquo;&nbsp;  Stephens went on to attack Mooney as an agitator with anarchistic  tendencies, and quoted some propaganda to demonstrate it.&nbsp;  He made no mention of the prisoner&rsquo;s innocence or the perjured  testimony.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title="">[29]</a> </p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tom Mooney&rsquo;s supporters  were outraged.&nbsp; Mooney himself made  a public statement from his cell at San Quentin refusing the commutation; he  insisted on his innocence and demanded a new trial.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a>&nbsp; <em>The Seattle Union Record</em> protested that the cowardly decision left &ldquo;the real question untouched,&rdquo;  that of an innocent man convicted on perjured evidence.&nbsp;  &ldquo;WE MUST HAVE JUSTICE,&rdquo; the paper demanded, &ldquo;if the wheels of  industry must be stopped indefinitely.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="">[31]</a>&nbsp;  The next day, labor leaders in New York announced continued agitation for  the nation-wide general strike set for December 9.&nbsp;  The Seattle Central Labor Council proceeded with plans for the feeding of  thousands of people during the strike.&nbsp; Minneapolis  was ready to stay out indefinitely to win Mooney&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Three hundred thousand New York workers vowed to support the strike, and  petitioned President Wilson to press for a new trial.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a>&nbsp;  Riled up Canadian workers in Vancouver and Victoria declared their  intention to walk out December 9 in support of Mooney&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp;  Angry San Francisco rank and file workers were planning to defy their  reluctant leaders and join the general strike.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title="">[33]</a>&nbsp; <em>The Seattle Union Record</em> continued to print in large bold type in a box at the bottom of its front page:  December 9.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  On December 3rd,  just days from the still-growing walkout, the International Workers&rsquo; Defense  League in San Francisco, which had been coordinating the Mooney defense effort,  called on supporting unions to postpone the planned strike.&nbsp;  Instead, unions would send delegates to Chicago January 14th,  to a Mooney Labor Congress that would plan the general strike and broaden its  support.&nbsp; The extra time would allow  for the Dunsmuir expose to be publicized.&nbsp; And  the support of Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor could be  enlisted.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[34]</a>&nbsp;  Such was the hopeful thinking that accompanied the collapse of the Mooney  general strike, on the same day that the Armistice to World War I was being  signed in Paris.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The labor council in  Seattle, &ldquo;where the general strike movement had been the strongest in the  country with practically every local union ready to lay down tools on the date  set,&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title="">[35]</a> struggled to put a bright face on the postponement of the strike.&nbsp;  While calling off the action and asking all local unions to select  delegates to the Mooney Congress, labor council leader James Duncan expressed  confidence that &ldquo;if the strike had been called in Seattle on December 9 it  would have tied things up as tight as ever a city was tied in history.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title="">[36]</a>&nbsp;  Dunne embraced the reasons for the postponement, trusting in the  judgement of the Workers&rsquo; Defense League that the general strike could be made  more effective with better preparation.&nbsp; The  labor council fired off a request to Samuel Gompers of the American Federation  of Labor that the A.F.L. take charge of the general strike proposed by the  Chicago Mooney congress.&nbsp; Seattle  unions set about selecting delegates to the congress set for January 14.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By the time in mid-December  that James Duncan was chosen to represent the Seattle Central Labor Council at  the Mooney congress, a reply had already been received from the A.F.L.&nbsp;  &ldquo;No strike of any character&rdquo; would be supported by Gompers or the  Federation.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">[37]</a>&nbsp;  The Mooney Defense League meeting in Chicago would remain outside the  mainstream of organized labor.&nbsp; Still,  expectations were high for &ldquo;the largest convention of the rank and file of  labor ever held.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seattle unions  would be sending as many as fifty delegates to join thousands of others in  Chicago.&nbsp; Dunne and the Seattle  council were hopeful that the congress could also deal questions of industrial  unionism, international solidarity, freedom for other political prisoners, and  reform of the A.F.L.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title="">[38]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hidden in the intense focus  on the Mooney struggle were the contentious negotiations in the West Coast  shipyards.&nbsp; On December 10, the many  various unions that formed the Metal Trades Council united to overwhelmingly  pass strike authorization for the Council to invoke against Seattle shipyards,  should the negotiations fail to bring a living wage to lower-paid workers.&nbsp;  The Seattle craft unions had essentially become a broad industrial union  on the waterfront.&nbsp; While dozens of  Seattle delegates from the Metal Trades unions were preparing to go to Chicago,  thousands of their members were growing angrier over unfair collusion between  the shipyard owners and the government Macy Board.&nbsp;  Leaders of the waterfront unions would be returning from the Chicago  congress to an increasingly tense situation in the shipyard standoff. Seattle  workers remained primed and ready for general strike.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[39]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The New Year&rsquo;s Day headlines in the <em>Seattle  Union Record</em> outlined three modes of action to be proposed in Chicago:  demands for federal intervention, corrective legislation in California, and the  strike.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title="">[40]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  James Duncan, traveling through San Francisco January 12 on his way to  Chicago, sought to confer with leaders of the International Worker&rsquo;s Defense  League and to persuade recalcitrant San Francisco labor leaders to join the  congress and the fight for Mooney.&nbsp; There  he visited Tom Mooney in prison, and reported back to the <em>Union Record</em> that &ldquo;since shaking his hand and looking him squarely  in the eye, I am now convinced of his innocence.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[41]</a>&nbsp;  Four days later, with the Chicago congress in its final contentious day,  the Metal Trades Council in Seattle unanimously voted to set the following  Tuesday, January 21, as a strike date if the wage issues could not be resolved.&nbsp;  The issue was fairness: as put by A.E. Miller of the negotiating  committee, the increase offered the higher paid mechanics &ldquo;was nothing more or  less than a sop to make them desert the poor devils who were hardly getting  enough to exist upon.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[42]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Mooney Congress was, in  fact, contentious.&nbsp; The only thing  readily agreed upon was to call for the removal of Samuel Gompers as leader of  the A.F.L.&nbsp; There were fights over  procedure, conflicts over accreditation, contests over broadening the program  beyond the simple Mooney strike issue, squabbles over who would chair the  meeting.&nbsp; The biggest fight took  place over the timing of the proposed Mooney general strike.&nbsp;  One faction, of which Seattle delegates were a part, wanted to capture  the current momentum and set the date for May Day.&nbsp;  The dominant faction insisted on postponing it until July 4.&nbsp;  Fiery argument continued to the closing session where debate was cut off  in an abrupt adjournment.&nbsp; <em>The Seattle Union Record</em> reported January 18 that &ldquo;Puget Sound  delegates held an indignation meeting after adjournment, and many delegates left  the meeting bitterly resenting the action&rdquo; of the congress chairman.&nbsp;  At the close of the congress, W.E. Dunn of Butte, Montana, editor of the  only other daily labor-owned newspaper, spoke for those pushing for a May first  strike date: &ldquo;This general strike is revolution.&nbsp;  It strikes at the power of the courts.&nbsp;  The world today is living on a powder magazine.&nbsp;  Something may happen any day in this country which will arouse the  employers of labor to the real dangers that confront them.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[43]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Three days later the  &ldquo;powder magazine&rdquo; erupted in Puget Sound, when 45,000 shipyard workers  walked off the job. &ldquo;All reports indicate that the strike has been called  absolutely &lsquo;clean&rsquo;,&rdquo; announced Miller of the Seattle strike committee.&nbsp;  &ldquo;The men have walked out en masse and none have remained at the  plants.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[44]</a>&nbsp;  In Tacoma, 15,000 shipyard workers walked out and were not shy; on Day  Two of the action, Tacoma workers sounded the call for a general strike.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[45]</a>&nbsp;  In Seattle, where 32,000 workers had left the shipyards &ldquo;standing  silent and deserted,&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="">[46]</a>the  Metal Trades Council followed Tacoma strikers on Day Three with its own call for  general strike.&nbsp; On January 22 it  requested the Central Labor Council to set a general strike date for as early as  February 1, and to &ldquo;call the strike when the referendum carried.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title="">[47]</a>&nbsp;  By January 24 the first unions were voting unanimously to support the  strike.&nbsp; Cooperative grocery stores  controlled by shipyard unions pledged to counter actions by the Retail  Grocers&rsquo; Association to cut off credit to striking workers, and to provide  food for all.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[48]</a>&nbsp;  On January 28, the Seattle Central Labor reported that a majority of  unions had voted to join the general strike, and immediately set about planning  for the action.&nbsp; In one week, the  shipyard strike had exploded into the &ldquo;first general strike ever called in the  United States&rdquo;, now barreling toward a deadline of Thursday, February 6, 1919.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title="">[49]</a></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the wheels did stop  turning in Seattle that Thursday morning in a historic display of labor  solidarity and cooperation, that singular event was rightful heir to the  passionate drive for justice that inspired the fight to save Mooney&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;  The remarkable timeline that linked the two events provided the  historical opportunity for the two struggles to blend into each other.&nbsp;  Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;first general strike in U.S. history&rdquo; may have not  played out as it did were it not for the enormous momentum of the Mooney  campaign, the extraordinary confidence and resolve of Seattle labor leaders  developed during the frustrating struggle for justice, and the support within a  Seattle community alarmed by the personal injustice of the Mooney case.&nbsp;  A strike for wages was informed and elevated by a higher calling.&nbsp;  And we should not underestimate the value of preparedness.&nbsp;  Having &ldquo;rehearsed&rdquo; the general strike right up to Mooney&rsquo;s  execution date less than eight weeks earlier, Seattle&rsquo;s aroused workers were  ready to act as one.</p>
