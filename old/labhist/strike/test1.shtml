   <p>When the various unions of Seattle put down their tools and walked off the job   on February 6, 1919 the city came to a halt. All but the most urgent services   ceased as the sympathy strike for the shipyard workers on Seattle&rsquo;s docks took   hold. While the city lay dormant, the mayor, city officials, union leaders and   Henry Suzzallo worked day and night to find solution to the strike.</p>
   <p> Henry Suzzallo, however was not a city official or a labor leader. He was  the President of the University of Washington, a president whose connections to  state and federal leaders resulted in appointments to positions of more power  and prestige. Governor Lister had landed him the powerful job of Director of the  State Council of Defense during the war and bizarrely enough asked Suzzallo to  fill his position as he lay dying during the strike. Suzzallo&rsquo;s unwavering  patriotism and close compliance with conservative wartime rhetoric and practice  were evident not only in his work as a Chairman of the Council of Defense but  also as President of the University of Washington. </p>
   <p>From the beginning of his presidency,  Suzzallo was a central player in the labor issues of the era. He imposed his own  political and ideological beliefs on a university, that while largely compliant  had its resistant Socialist faculty and a small, but active leftist student  community. These campus dissenters resisted Suzzallo and the regents&rsquo;  indoctrination using many of the methods organized labor: speeches, pamphleteering  and strikes. Suzzallo&rsquo;s attempts to suppress socialism on campus would meet  with middling success as there was a strong support system between powerful  labor movement of the are and the Socialist and pro-labor issues and ideologues  on campus. Nonetheless, many of the University of Washington&rsquo;s more radical  students and a few professors were removed or left during Suzzallo&rsquo;s early  years, finding Campus a stifling environ for radicalism. </p>
   <p>This  essay is an exploration of Henry Suzzallo&rsquo;s role as an anti-radical authority  figure from 1915 through the 1919 General Strike in Seattle. Suzzallo became an  increasingly conservative anti-radical leader as his clout in the state grew; he  tried to shape the University in his own political and intellectual ideals.  Backed by a nervous business community Suzzallo worked to rid the university of  radicalism and to instill a patriotic ethos on campus. To a degree Suzzallo was  successful. Some radical professors left, but other remained. Suzzallo saw the  greatest change in the student body, those radicals that remained on campus in  February of 1919 did so covertly, the rest stood behind their President. </p>
   <p>By the time Seattle was in the throes of the  General Strike, Suzzallo, his supporters and opposition at the University had  been through a number of strikes of their own. Suzzallo&rsquo;s sympathy for  organized labor waned as he served on strike mediation boards. The Industrial  Workers of the World, revolutionary-minded labor activists central to lumber  strikes in the Pacific Northwest, engendered much of his contempt while he  served on strike mediation boards. His sympathy for organized labor waned the  more involved he became in the State Council of Defense embracing a new  patriotic conservatism that had little room for the dissention of labor. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo became President of the University  in 1915, the result of an Horatio Alger-esqe career. The son of Yugoslavian  immigrants, he attended public schools in San Jose, California. Suzzallo worked  to overcome his family&rsquo;s lack of funds and his own poor grades to attend  Stanford. He divided his time from year to year working as a principal at a  local school and attending the university, graduating in 1899. While at Stanford  he studied the burgeoning fields of sociology and education; melding the two  into his own philosophy of early indoctrination, "educational  sociology." He developed his oratory and leadership skills at Columbia&rsquo;s  Teacher&rsquo;s College, mentored by Nicholas Murray Butler. From Butler and other  models of educational theory Suzzallo developed a conception of education as a  socializing tool. </p>
   <p>Universities at the time were undergoing  great growth and Suzzallo, greatly influenced by the faith in science of the  early twentieth century, sought efficient and rational teaching methods and  systems. Suzzallo&rsquo;s confidence in science and scientific management was  developing at the same time that new ideas about the organization of  universities were being explored by presidents like Eliot at Harvard, White at  Cornell, Hall at Chicago University and Jordan at Stanford. Like his  predecessors, Suzzallo wanted to turn the University of Washington into a great  university and leave the school a rational, efficient institution. </p>
   <p>Following his swearing in as President,  Suzzallo began to make changes in the interest of educational efficiency. One of  the first, was to focus intellectual energy at the UW in Seattle, thereby  reducing the State College in Pullman to an agricultural tech school. Suzzallo  whittled away at Washington State while developing the Departments of Fisheries,  Forestry and other sciences of the University in Seattle. Suzzallo was also  behind the birth of the College of Business Administration and the  University&rsquo;s growing libraries. Suzzallo defended his reorganization of the  two schools on the grounds of educational efficiency; the state did not need two  adequate liberal arts schools, but an agricultural school and a powerful liberal  arts institute. </p>
   <p>At the same time theories of efficiency and  scientific management were becoming a part of university administration, new  ideas about labor mediation were forming. Scholars were beginning to turn their  new theories of psychology and sociology towards laborers, where scientific  management had already been applied. Academics like John R. Commons and Carleton  Parker were examining the drive to unionize in psychological and sociological  terms, theorizing ways to make industrial relations less violent. Their academic  approach led them to conclude that much of the strife between owner and employee  could be mediated. Mediation, Commons, believed was a solution to scientific  management with its "cold calculations, was a method he believed, "has  the defects of autocracy," since it, "begins and ends with individuals  separated from their fellows." Commons theory of "Industrial  Goodwill" was a new approach to the long-standing problems of labor  dispute, most of which were ended in some way or another with violence. </p>
   <p>Carleton Parker, a contemporary of Commons,  concluded from his observations that the increasingly revolutionary labor  movement could be psychologically analyzed. Parker believed that labor unrest,  especially migratory labor like Seattle&rsquo;s, was rooted in poor working  conditions, long hours and seasonal unemployment. Parker believed that the cure  for these, "tragic symptoms of a sick social order," was to alleviate  the causes of worker maladjustment. Parker&rsquo;s believed that unrest, even the  "problem of unionism" could be solved if employers hired psychologists  to assess worker dissatisfaction and improved working conditions accordingly.  Many businessmen labeled Parker a labor sympathizer </p>
   <p>Suzzallo&rsquo;s adherence to scientific  methodology did not prevent him from mediating labor disputes the way Commons  had designed. Mediation, performed by a disinterested expert was becoming a  popular method of solving labor disputes and Suzzallo, as a man of academia, was  often called upon as a mediator. His motivations seem less rooted in the  progressive agendas of Commons or Parker, whom he brought to the University in  1917, but more in his duty to state and country. </p>
   <p>The University that Suzzallo inherited in  1915 was already an important part of the city, with faculty, staff and students  as embroiled in the events of the day. The people that made up the University  also made up the city and its politics. And like the city it was not a place of  pure socialism nor was it one of completely blind faith in Americanism. Rather,  the university was a mix of outspoken patriots, soldiers, veterans and those  with strong anti-radical notions as well as a number of labor sympathizers and  radicals. Individuals and groups on campus were actively involved with the  larger community. Students joined labor organizations, enlisted in the armed  services, professors spoke to labor groups while others served on committees  that oversaw intelligence bureaus.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>&nbsp;Suzzallo&rsquo;s disapproved  immediately of the varied and at times outspoken politics of campus. He reported  to his mentor Butler that "a group of radicals were ruling the faculty and  students by sheer aggressiveness.". In much the same way he began to  privilege the University in Seattle over the College in Pullman, Suzzallo began  making changes that better suited his own political agendas. The new President  set about reorganizing departments in an effort to isolate faculty whose  politics he believed were dangerous. Many businessmen viewed J. Allen Smith, an  outspoken radical professor of Political Science, who wrote The Spirit of  American Government, as a serious threat. According to biographer Donald T.  Williams, Suzzallo and many Seattle businessmen wanted to remove Smith, but  Smith was popular with students and a prominent figure who had the backing of  the powerful local branch of the American Federation of Labor, Seattle&rsquo;s  Central Labor Council. One of Smith&rsquo;s students recalled in her memoirs that  Smith escaped dismissal by Suzzallo because James Duncan, Secretary of the C.L.C.  "went up to him and said, &lsquo;If you fire the McMahons or J. Allen Smith you  won&rsquo;t last long as president.&rsquo;" Unable to fire Smith outright, Suzzallo  opted to isolate him. He split the Department of Political and Social Science  into three new departments: Sociology, a School of Commerce and the Department  of Political Science whose faculty was entirely composed of one, J. Allen Smith. </p>
   <p>Smith may have been isolated from other  faculty members to a degree, but his influence among students remained. Smith  reportedly criticized Seattle Times publisher Colonel Blethen for  supporting for the Minneapolis Street Railways, a monopoly in Blethen&rsquo;s  hometown. When students attending the University of Washington in the teens had  demonstrated their political savvy and power in the Chimes Incident of 1912,  Smith and President Kane took much of the blame. Students, incensed over Colonel  Blethen&rsquo;s gift of a set of chimes to the University, protested, despite the  regent&rsquo;s "gag-rule" and the matter became one of the reasons for  President Kane&rsquo;s dismissal. The controversy was one of many episodes when Kane  had defended free speech on campus; he had refused to fire Smith a few years  earlier. Kane&rsquo;s eventual dismissal by the Regents in 1914 and the hiring of  Suzzallo were no doubt linked to conservative opposition to free speech on  campus. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo began his presidency as an advocate  of free speech, he believed that students should abide by the "ideals and  methods" of the University. In his inaugural speech to the University  Suzzallo outlined his expectations of students. He expressed a hope that  students commit themselves to "reasonable and moral" action. As well,  Suzzallo pledged that problems would be treated in a democratic fashion, but  warned, "Only when you show yourself morally insensitive to real issues of  human right and wrong, . . . shall I interfere. Then I shall interfere with an  iron hand." Suzzallo&rsquo;s iron hand was tested that year when students, some  of whom were Socialists, began protesting compulsory military drilling. </p>
   <p>The Student&rsquo;s Anti-Drill Society dispersed  3,000 copies of a pamphlet entitled, "Compulsory Military Drill, a Great  College Menace, and called for mass meetings to discuss the matter. President  Suzzallo allowed the meetings and protests, but the next spring when the faculty  voted on the matter, compulsory drilling was retained. Following the vote  Suzzallo told assembled cadet corps that he expected a new "enthusiasm and  strength that is necessary for the defense of our nation." War preparedness  was a growing concern as the war in Europe unfolded and a growing point of  contention for the labor movement. </p>
   <p>Much of organized labor had adopted the  International Socialist belief that the war was a capitalist venture, pitting  working men against each other while war time profits piled up. Military  drilling remained on campus throughout the war and well into the 1920&rsquo;s  continuing to be a source of strife between labor and the University. Pacifism  ran hard against the growing wartime patriotism and the mass protests against  military training on campus faded as the University became committed to the war  effort. It was a time when being a radical on campus was an increasingly  dangerous occupation. Suzzallo&rsquo;s work with the State Council of Defense made  it no easier to be a radical anywhere else in the state. </p>
   <p>In Washington and all over the U.S.,  patriotic war-effort sentiments prevailed and attitudes and activities deemed  "un-American" or seditious were watched with a cautious eye. At the  top of the list of groups to watch in Washington and at the University were  those of German descent, Socialists, anarchists and especially the Industrial  Workers of the World. The I.W.W. became scapegoats blamed for the increasingly  assertive labor movement&rsquo;s strikes and demands. The Wobblies were not popular  with the American Federation of Labor for their one big union idea and business  hated them for stirring workers to strike. Government tended to side with  business, wary of the group for its revolutionary rhetoric. Many believed that  the I.W.W. were part of a Russian Bolshevist plan to overtake the U.S., others  feared Wobblies were German operatives working to sabotage war production. </p>
   <p>As Chairman of the State Council of Defense,  Suzzallo headed a governmental group that only considered the I.W.W. a threat to  America. The Council of Defense, a far-reaching umbrella organization that  oversaw numerous wartime efforts, was a springboard for Suzzallo&rsquo;s  demonstration of patriotism. In addition to overseeing the organization, he  served on mediation boards of two pivotal labor strikes that preceded and may  have influenced the General Strike of 1919. Suzzallo worked with James A. Duncan  to settle the Seattle Street Car Strike of 1917 and his work on the Wobblie-tinged  lumber strikes of 1917 further galvanized his anti-I.W.W. stance. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;The  I.W.W. were in fact organizing and spreading the word of solidarity and strikes  in logging communities, much to the chagrin of state officials. The Council of  Defense notes in its 1919 Report to the Governor of Washington that accounts of  "roaming bands of I.W.W. seemingly well supplied with money, and of  numerous threats that warehouses and grain fields would destroyed by fire, if  their unreasonable demands were not met." The State Council of Defense  devotes seven pages of its report entirely to the problems it encountered  dealing with the I.W.W. and lumber strikes. There is no author cited, but it can  be assumed that the report reflects the vision of Suzzallo and his fellow  council members. </p>
   <p>The I.W.W. was perceived as a genuine threat  to the war effort and as "directly opposed to our government." The  response of the Council and other government agencies was to organize a system  of citizens, secret service operatives and troops to monitor and counter the  Wobblie threat. Suzzallo showed no signs of sympathy for the I.W.W.: telegrams  to lumber mill owners and managers show a distinct spite for Wobblies.  Suzzallo&rsquo;s Council of Defense worked in concert with Disque&rsquo;s Loyal Legion  of Loggers stemming the I.W.W. influence in the camps by way of intelligence  services, essentially spy rings, reporting to both the Council and Disque who  dispatched Loyal Legions to problem areas. </p>
   <p>In a letter to J.H. Bloedel of the Bloedel-Donovan  Lumber Mills Suzzallo thanks Bloedel for supplying intelligence information  about the Wobblies and labor unions in his camps. Suzzallo notes the reports  (which were not kept) "certainly casts a suspicion on organized  labor." Whether Suzzallo and others&rsquo; suspicion of the power of the I.W.W.  were founded or not is superseded by their personal fears. Suzzallo continues  his letter writing, "I had hoped we could separate the goats from the sheep  completely. It would be a great disappointment to me personally if the present  mentioned crisis could not separate everybody from the I.W.W." Suzzallo&rsquo;s  stance on the I.W.W. and organized labor in this short telegram is particularly  revealing. Suzzallo&rsquo;s paternalistic view of labor issues is evident in his  language. Suzzallo refers to the "goats" and "sheep," for  Suzzallo labor becomes not so much humans, but groups that must be dealt with  the way a rancher deals with livestock. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo&rsquo;s view of labor was certainly not  as sympathetic as Carleton Parker&rsquo;s, a fellow sociologist/economist he hired  in 1917. They both believed in the positive outcome of mediation, and viewed  both labor and owners as legitimate bargaining parties. But as Suzzallo dealt  more with outspoken radicals, Socialists and Wobblies on campus and in  particular, his war-work as head of the Council of Defense, his compassion for  organized labor waned. The war was a major source of Suzzallo&rsquo;s changing  beliefs about labor. Unlike Parker who was interested in finding solutions to  the problems laborers faced in the workplace, Suzzallo&rsquo;s professional interest  in labor was limited to a regard for labor as a source of seditious thought and  in terms of efficiency. </p>
   <p>While  this may sound a bit heavy-handed, it becomes clear that this was not an  uncommon way to think of labor at the time. Suzzallo&rsquo;s reports on shipyard  efficiency demonstrate a similar regard labor as a part of the machinery that  must be maintained. Labor itself recognized this attitude and used it in their  own pamphlets and leaflets. The famous We&rsquo;re Ready pamphlet of the  General Strike aimed at striking workers reads, "Labor power under the  present system is a commodity," a commodity that organized labor claimed  had been exploited long enough. The pamphlet further notes that labor produces  "more than is necessary to maintain itself on." Therefore, the  argument continues, "the products and the industries of the world are ours  by right." Labor was in no way willing to be the easily shepherded sheep  that Suzzallo and Seattle businessmen wanted. It is not surprising that such  rhetoric frightened the business interests of Washington at the time. It must be  remembered that the Bolshevik Revolution had taken place in Russia only a few  years prior to the General Strike. Fear of a similar Socialist takeover weighed  heavy on the minds of those who ran and owned businesses. In their concern they  turned to agencies like Suzzallo&rsquo;s to monitor and counter labor&rsquo;s growing  agitators. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo was happy to comply, a quick look  through his papers concerning his role as Council of Defense director present a  man who took his duties quite seriously and personally. Suzzallo obviously  enjoyed the camaraderie of the united cause of the war effort and the  connections with powerful people in the state it afforded him, not to mention a  certain glee in persecuting those who opposed him. A telegram to H.D. Young of  Marysville proudly outlines the three months of work that resulted in an  intelligence bureau and ends with Suzzallo ambition to utilize the bureau to  "really find the seditious people." Sedition was serious business and  accusation often led to arrest and even jail time, a consequence many members of  the I.W.W. came to know all too well.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>It was the I.W.W. that raised the greatest ire from officials like  Suzzallo. He kept himself abreast of their activities by way of his intelligence  bureau, the Minutemen and communicated with lumber mill managers about the  status of I.W.W. influence in their camps. B.H. Hornby of the Dover Lumber Co of  Dover, Idaho supplied Suzzallo with intelligence reports in early 1918, Suzzallo  replied via telegram thanking him and voiced his own personal stance on  organized labor and the I.W.W. "I do not believe these professional I.W.W.  can carry the men out when the substantial causes for discontent are  removed." The "substantial causes for discontent were largely to be  found in the long hours that lumber industry workers endured, ten, twelve and  even fourteen hour days while their urban counterparts had already won the now  standard eight-hour work day. </p>
   <p>Despite Suzzallo&rsquo;s scorn for the I.W.W. he  was fairly sympathetic to the demands and desires of the average worker. His own  work on labor mediation boards reveals a compassion for organized labor&rsquo;s  reasonable requests for shorter hours and better working conditions. How much of  his sympathy was influenced by governmental haste, as was the case with spruce  collection is up for debate. Carlton Parker greatly aided Suzzallo in the lumber  strikes, his sympathies for labor, even the I.W.W. were well known and may also  have been an influence on the mediation. Nonetheless, Suzzallo was quite  familiar with the various industries whose prosperity hinged on war dollars,  namely lumber and shipbuilding.   As one of his duties to the Council of Defense in 1918, Suzzallo filed an  Investigation into Labor Efficiency of Steel Shipbuilding Yards, in the  report he discusses, among other efficiency concerns, the "Slacking of  Labor." Slackerism, a term bandied about and usually used in conjunction  with sedition, socialism and pacifists, referred to those who shirked their  patriotic responsibility to work for the war effort. The more vocal devotees of  labor radicalism in Seattle, particularly those of Socialist bent, viewed the  war as a giant capitalist venture that pitted international workers against each  other while war time profits soared. Pacifism and slackerism went hand in hand,  according to many business people who were often concerned that Socialist  workers in the teeming shipyards of Seattle, were intentionally stalling or  sabotaging work to impede the war effort. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo&rsquo;s investigation reports that  "Labor is reasonably efficient in the ship yards," however, Suzzallo  writes, "it can truly be said that laborers are not spending their energies  freely." Suzzallo credits some of the idleness to management, an influx of  "green and young labor" as well as a variety of legitimate reasons for  what had been rumored to be slackerism. More likely to slow production than  saboteurs was Seattle&rsquo;s notorious cold, rainy weather, which at times cooled  the ship&rsquo;s hulls so much that it was impossible to drive the rivets. .  Suzzallo concluded that while many of the stories of loafing workers were  "exaggerated" and could be explained, "there was possibly some  truth in the stories that labor unions cause some slowing up in the work." </p>
   <p>When  Suzzallo&rsquo;s authority was called on to mediate the lumber strike, he followed  his sense of duty and lost the support of a very powerful industry. Strikes  demanding an eight-hour day had halted the badly needed lumber for the  war-effort. Neither the unions, nor the mill owners would concede. As the need  for lumber grew stronger, Suzzallo had to buckle and comply with the Federal  government. Suzzallo&rsquo;s response was to side with the Wilson administration&rsquo;s  request to end the strikes and institute the eight-hour day. For his decision  Suzzallo was criticized as being a labor sympathizer by some. It was not the  only time his politics and decisions would garner criticism. </p>
   <p>Both business and labor attacked the  president for his policies on campus during the war, especially those concerning  military drilling. Drilling, which had been a touchy subject, became only that  much more inflamed as students, as early as 1915, staged protests against the  mandatory military preparedness exercises. Pacifist students on campus had the  full support of labor unions and following the war, women&rsquo;s clubs.  Nonetheless, the mandatory drills continued through the war years and after,  much to the praise of local business associations and legionnaire clubs. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;The  debate over military training raged on into the 1920&rsquo;s, years after the  Armistice was signed. Letters poured into the University of Washington Board of  Regents during 1921 and 1922. The unions adopted a form letter outlining an  argument organized labor had been using for years against militarism. The  Central Labor Councils of cities and towns across Washington sent a letter  summarized their opposition to the training young men at the university in  "the science of modern warfare for the apparent benefit of the armament  maker and at the expense of the already overtaxed people." The appeals  conclude that "the training of you men in the science of taking human life  is subversive of every human instinct, it is in contrast to every ideal of the  labor movement." While the appeal of the labor movement did not fall on  deaf ears, it certainly fell on unsympathetic ears, ears that were tuned more to  the congratulatory voice of business. </p>
   <p>For the most part Suzzallo was congratulated  for his conservative stance on militarism by businessmen, but there were those  who felt Suzzallo was spending too much of his energy away from the still too  liberal University. Edwin Selvin, editor of the Business Chronicle of the  Pacific Northwest, was outraged when the first draftee in Seattle, a senior  at the UW, refused conscription as a Socialist conscientious objector. Ernest  Leo was quoted in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer claiming that he was  indoctrinated in the Seattle Public Schools and the University. "I believe  personally, that I am not at fault, but my education is at fault." He told  the paper. " Selvin was furious that Suzzallo&rsquo;s University was producing  Socialists. He cried, "Business men whose sons and daughters are attending  this State Institution, will not be satisfied until the allegation of this  member of the student body is either disproved, or if found to be true, those  responsible therefore are summarily dismissed." Leo and Selvin&rsquo;s  editorial were no doubt a great embarrassments to the President. For the rest of  the war Suzzallo adopted a strong pro-militarism agenda for campus. </p>
   <p>Despite  the occasional criticism business in Seattle was supportive of the  University&rsquo;s management. The Seattle Chamber of Commerce, one of the most  agitated groups during the General Strike, sent a letter to the Board of Regents  congratulating the University for their continuation of military drilling. The  Chamber believed, "such training tends to promote citizenship, patriotism  and Americanization." Suzzallo and members of the Board of Regents  wholeheartedly agreed with the views of the Chamber of Commerce. In what must  have been more than coincidence, many of the Regents and professors were  appointed positions on the Council of Defense, alongside many business people. </p>
   <p>While much of the business community  supported Suzzallo, much of the labor movement regarded the president as a  serious threat, Suzzallo&rsquo;s most scathing critic was Anna Louise Strong. While  the university was not usually a source of labor news or commentary, Strong  wrote a few telling columns about the University of Washington and Suzzallo, the  "Campus Kaiser." Strong, an exceptional radical, even for I.W.W.  occupied Washington, wrote an assertive, sarcastic poem for the Seattle Daily  Call in 1917 criticizing Suzzallo&rsquo;s actions as both Defense Councilman and  President of the University. The poem, "Who Killed Our University?" is  a biting critique of Suzzallo&rsquo;s repression of free speech, his support of  militarism and the exodus of faculty from campus. </p>
   <p>Strong viewed the University as a dead place  for the free thinker, especially the pacifist: </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  And now the University with all its many  schools </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  Is now a campus Army which the Campus Kaiser  rules </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  To talk or write with freedom is such a dire  disgrace </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  That five and twenty teachers just up and  left the place. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  And he passed the word this fall </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  That the faculty and students were no longer </p>
   <p>&nbsp;  To think at all. </p>
   <p>Although  the poem is caustic, many of Strong&rsquo;s points about Suzzallo&rsquo;s censure of the  university and its subsequent effects were accurate. </p>
   <p>Indeed, Suzzallo did advocate a  policy of unquestioning faith in patriotic leaders. In a speech he made to the  Seattle Chamber of Commerce he said, "we must cease being a debating  society in which every man shall have his say, and become a nation with few  experts leading and the large crowd appreciating and supporting them." No  doubt this was well received by the members of the Chamber of Commerce, people  with intimate contacts to those "few experts" who were indeed making  it very uncomfortable to debate or a have one&rsquo;s say. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo&rsquo;s support of military training  continued and his disdain for Socialist and radicals multiplied, however they  existed on campus. Political Science professor and known Socialist sympathizer  Abraham Bergland was asked to leave, and did. Bergland&rsquo;s Germanic name was  probably no great aid to his defense. Three members of the German department of  the University of Washington resigned on May 20, 1918 after being hounded by the  press and others. While there were dismissals and resignations from the faculty,  most weathered the storm of indignation for pacifist and radicals. </p>
   <p>Strong&rsquo;s  "five and twenty" refugee professors was probably an exaggeration,  many instructors did find themselves at a university where federal Secret  Service operatives and fellow staff were constantly watching anyone suspected of  sedition. Suzzallo&rsquo;s war work and rising notoriety in both the state and  national politics made him all the more paranoid about sedition in lumber mills,  shipyards and on campus. Employing the power granted by the Council of Defense,  Suzzallo took the matter of sedition on campus upon himself. He confided in Ruth  Karr McKee, a regent and fellow Council of Defense member, that he had,  "unusual opportunities to keep watch on the instructional staff."  Suzzallo requested that the federal Secret Service watch all persons of German  descent and those in the German department and he mobilized his own secret  service within the university. Suzzallo took these matters into his own hands,  no doubt part of his duty as one of those "few experts" to be trusted  during a time when pacifists, Wobblies and professors were viewed as serious  threats to the war effort and business. </p>
   <p>Professors like J. Allen Smith and  instructor Theresa McMahon were likely among those Suzzallo were keeping tabs  on. Both were staunch supporters of unions, fought for the eight-hour day and  lectured on labor issues. Both donated time and funds to the labor movement.  McMahon, an instructor in the Economics department, received a payment of $60  for lectures she had given to the Workers College in late 1919. She returned the  check noting that the school was in need of funds and offered her support,  wishing "success in your future work with the college."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Smith, one student recalled, was a vehement liberal who gave impassioned  lectures. Smith once reportedly delivered a lecture on free speech after a  ruling on left wing mail restrictions was issued. "Smith was a ruddy-faced  fella to begin with," the student remembers, "but on this occasion he  was so heated up that his face went purple." Smith spoke to the class, half  of which was uniformed soldiers, concluding his speech, he dramatically,  "raised his fists. He says, &lsquo;America is not fit to be a member of the  Society of Masons.&rsquo;" The student remembers thinking it "a very bold  piece of behavior." Indeed it was bold behavior from a man who would send  an undisclosed amount of money to the labor journal, the Union Record,  telling Editor Ault that he did not care to make the matter public. Whether  Smith&rsquo;s statement was inspired by modesty or fear of retribution is unknown.  It can safely be said, however, that despite Suzzallo and the regent&rsquo;s  crackdown on dissidents, free thinkers did exist and communicate with the labor  movement. </p>
   <p>Support and disdain for labor did not come  solely from the management and faculty of the University. Students played just  as varied and important roles in the years building up to and during the General  Strike as their elders. Students protested, spied, worked as strike breakers,  joined unions and were as much a part of the labor controversies of the day as  anyone. The average student was probably like the average faculty member,  supportive of war efforts and the Council of Defense and wary of radicals,  especially the I.W.W. There were students who, like their elder counterparts,  were stationed at ideological opposites on labor issues as well, however, they  appear to have been the minority. </p>
   <p>Of those students who were labor oriented,  their experiences on campus and off during the war and strike years were  springboards to careers as leftists and labor advocates. Harvey O&rsquo;Connor, who  was briefly enrolled at the University, was working his way through the ranks of  labor journalism, writing for the Daily Call with Anna Louise Strong, the  International Weekly and the Union Record. O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s early  activism matured into full-length books on labor topics, including a history of  radicalism in Washington State. Like O&rsquo;Connor, Garland Ethel&rsquo;s early years  at the University made lasting impressions on the budding leftist. Both left  invaluable records of their impressions of Seattle, labor and the University  during the era. </p>
   <p>O&rsquo;Connor, who grew up around Tacoma,  became interested in labor at an early age and upon coming to Seattle to attend  the University in 1914, became involved in labor issues in Seattle. He was a  member of the Social-Democratic Club of the University of Washington, a club  that all but disappeared from the records when the war broke out. The UW club  was a charter of the larger New York based Intercollegiate Socialist Society, a  group founded by Socialist authors Upton Sinclair and Jack London. The  Social-Democrat Club disintegrated during the years Suzzallo was President. The  club may have been suppressed, but it is more likely that member like O&rsquo;Connor  found college too conservative and dropped out. O&rsquo;Connor had quit the  University by February of 1919 when the General Strike took place but his  activities as a labor journalist, particularly since he was editing the International  Weekly at the time, won him a place in jail with other alleged conspirators  of labor unrest following the Strike. O&rsquo;Connor and his friend from Tacoma Hays  Jones were arrested in the Seattle Police&rsquo;s Red roundups days after the Strike  came to a halt. </p>
   <p>O&rsquo;Connor and Jones, the University of  Washington Daily reported, were among the thirty-nine alleged radicals  rounded up by the police. O&rsquo;Connor, the paper stated, faced charges of  "publishing matter tending to incite a breach of the peace," and  "criminal anarchy, punishable by not more than ten years in the state  penitentiary and a fine of not more than $5000 or both. O&rsquo;Connor also faced a  gross misdemeanor charge. </p>
   <p>Hayes Jones, O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s friend, was  according to the UW Daily, a source of I.W.W. propaganda who had only  evaded conscription due to the fact that he was missing two fingers on his right  hand (possibly a lumber mill accident?). He was a laborite who in addition to  working on the Daily Call took a job working on the construction of Camp  Lewis in the summer of 1917. Jones and his politics did not last long there, he  was "escorted outside the camp and sent on his way,&rsquo; after being warned  by Secret Service men to "discontinue his I.W.W. propaganda." Jones  was also reportedly behind the 1915 student protests against military training  on campus. </p>
   <p>If the Daily article demonstrates the  general feeling of University of Washington students, radicalism was not  particularly popular. Harvey O&rsquo;Connor recalled in 1964 that during the  strikes, "students at the University, most of whom came from the middle and  upper classes, were paid to act as guards in their ROTC uniforms &lsquo;to help save  the world from the Bolsheviki.&rsquo;" Indeed, much of the student body stood  faithfully behind its expert leader, Dr. Suzzallo. </p>
   <p>Perhaps one of the most telling documents of  Suzzallo&rsquo;s influence on campus is a letter from the Associated Students of the  University of Washington President, Walter Hodge addressing the strike crisis  that had come to the state. Hodge, writing to express the student opinion on  campus, pledged the students&rsquo; support of "whatever action you may in your  discretion deem advisable." Hodge requested that should a need arise that  students be allowed to protect state property on campus, Suzzallo&rsquo;s home and  sorority houses from the mounting "ultra violent element (that) might wish  to take vengeance upon the University for any Sate action which they might  resent." </p>
   <p>Hodge&rsquo;s letter is evidence of the amazing  influence Suzzallo had upon his students as well as the mounting fears that made  radicalism hazardous on campus. Hodge pledges the students&rsquo; unquestioning  faith in Suzzallo&rsquo;s discretion. Students were eager to prove themselves as  loyal defenders of state property and the virtue of campus sororities. The male  organizations on campus were called upon to bolster the Seattle Police  department; members of fraternities, R.O.T.C. and other groups went downtown to  be deputized and issued clubs and guns. One former deputy, not from the  University, recalled twenty-eight years later that "it was a wonder that  some darn fool kid with bullets in his gun didn&rsquo;t blow somebody&rsquo;s head  off." Indeed it was a wonder after years of war-hype of defense and  warnings of the domestic radical threat, there was a certain trigger-happy mood  among many students on campus. </p>
   <p>The  war era was one punctuated by Secret Services and Minutemen spying. Suzzallo set  up a voluntary secret service within the university and had access to all the  state secret services and even asked the Federal Secret Service to watch the  German Department as well as people of German birth and descent. However, the  government and Defense Councils were not the only ones spying. One student,  Garland Ethel, returned from the war and enrolled in the University in January  of 1919 as a part-time student. Ethel worked to support himself and attend  school and had joined the blacksmith&rsquo;s union, but lacking funds for civilian  clothes he continued to wear his uniform. It was that uniform that camouflaged  him from unsuspecting business people who expressed their concern about labor  unrest to him openly. </p>
   <p>Ethel recalled that during the strike  wealthy people "cultivated the people in uniform," possibly for  protection. Members of these "superior classes" would pick up  uniformed men on University Way and take them wherever they wanted to go. Most  uniformed men, Ethel believes were headed down to volunteer, "for  anti-strike, anti-revolutionary services." Uniformed students, Ethel  remembers were immediately issued a gun and ammunition as reserve police forces.  Taking advantage of his position Ethel rode around the city with, "these  people of property and substance," who would "sound off" to him.  Ethel reported whatever information he had heard to the strike committee at  headquarters daily. </p>
   <p>Ethel, Hays and O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s pro-strike  actions are important to the understanding of a lively, if small group of  student labor sympathizers. For all their efforts, the U.W. campus was for the  most part dedicated to Suzzallo and his more conservative ideals. The Student  body, like much of the country, had embraced the leadership of people like  Suzzallo during the war. The war effort t brought great ideological and  political change to Seattle, and certainly to the University. Prior to the war  the University was where students organized against mandatory military training,  where student Socialist groups met and leftist politics were widely discussed.  By the end of the war, at the time of the General Strike, the prevailing  attitude of the University had become far more conservative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Henry Suzzallo was the driving force behind much of that change. His own  shifting views of organized labor coincided with appointment to the State  Council of Defense. While heading the Council, Suzzallo became more and more  wary of the power of organized labor, particularly the power of the I.W.W.  Suspicions of sedition were not limited to the labor camps; many University  professors and students found the campus an increasingly hostile place for labor  sympathizers and Socialists. Some, like Harvey O&rsquo;Connor, left of their own  accord to pursue intellectual discourse in more sympathetic communities.  Professors like Theresa McMahon and J. Allen Smith persevered with the support  of powerful labor leaders, while professors in the German Department, hounded by  war-hysteria, resigned. </p>
   <p>Suzzallo was a powerful force in the city,  that state and most definitely on campus. He had a profound impact on the  political makeup of the University, and while not a great advocate of leftist  thought, he at times tolerated it. Suzzallo embraced his duties to state and  country serving on mediation boards and the State Council of Defense. His work  outside the University brought him into close contact with business interest and  heads of state, people whose ideas about labor, radicalism, and patriotism  reflected and influenced his own changing beliefs. Suzzallo, supported by these  interests, tried to indoctrinate the University, influencing much of an  independent student body to join the war effort and suppress sedition, in all  its forms. </p>
   <p>The University of Washington underwent a  great change in attitudes about labor in a few short years under Suzzallo. The  small contingent of student radicals that had been active on campus had for the  most part left. Suzzallo had made campus a militaristic place that was hostile  for radical students. The remaining student body had ceased to be the pro-active  community, instead they unquestioningly followed those few experts like  Suzzallo. The same student body that in 1915 supported an anti-militarism club  lined up at the door of the Seattle Police Department in 1919 to guard the city  from radicals.</p>
