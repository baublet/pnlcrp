 <div class="intro">The Seattle General Strike of February 1919 was the first twentieth century <strong>solidarity strike</strong> in the United States to be proclaimed a &ldquo;general strike.&rdquo; It led off a tumultuous era of post-World War I  <strong>labor conflict</strong> that saw massive strikes shut down the nation's steel, coal, and other industries and threaten <strong>civil unrest</strong> in a dozen cities. </div>
 <br />
  <div class="intro">The  strike began in  <strong>shipyards</strong> that had expanded rapidly with <strong>war production</strong> contracts.  35,000 workers expected a post-war <strong class="intro">pay hike</strong> to make up for two years of <strong>strict wage controls</strong> imposed by the federal government. </div>
  <br />
  <div class="intro">When  regulators refused, the Metal Trades Council union alliance declared a strike and <strong>closed the yards</strong>. After an appeal to Seattle&rsquo;s powerful Central Labor Council for help, nearly all of the city&rsquo;s 110 local unions  voted to join a <strong>sympathy walkout</strong>.  The Seattle General Strike lasted only six days but the memory of that event has continued to be of interest and importance for nearly a century.

</div>
  <div class="heading">February 6</div>
  <div>   <img src="images/strikersprepare-thumb.jpg" width="250" height="104" border="0" class="leftpic" alt="Strikers Prepare" />On the morning of February 6, 1919, Seattle, a city of 315,000 people, stopped working. 25,000 union members had joined the 35,000 already on strike. Much of the remaining work force was idled as stores closed and streetcars stopped running. The General Strike Committee, composed of delegates from the key striking unions, tried to coordinate vital services and negotiate with city officials, but events moved quickly beyond their control.</div>
     <div class="heading">Americanism vs. Bolshevism?</div>
  <div>   <img src="images/servingfood-thumb.jpg" width="250" height="144" border="0" style="float:left;margin-top:7px;margin-right:7px;" alt="Serving food" />Most of the local and national press denounced the strike, while conservatives called for stern measures to suppress what looked to them to be a revolutionary plot. Mayor Ole Hanson, deputized and armed 2,400 supporters and threatened martial law. Two U.S. Army battalions moved into the city. Some of the unions wavered on the strike's third day. Most others had gone back to work by the time the Central Labor Council officially declared an end on February 11. By then police and vigilantes were hard at work rounding up Reds. The IWW hall and Socialist Party headquarters were raided and leaders arrested. Federal agents also closed the <em>Union Record</em>, the labor-owned daily newspaper, and arrested several of its staff. Meanwhile across the country headlines screamed the news that Seattle had been saved, that the revolution had been broken, that, as Mayor Hanson phrased it, &ldquo;Americanism&rdquo; had triumphed over &ldquo;Bolshevism.&rdquo;  </div>

    <img src="images/nooneknowswhere-thumb.jpg" width="250" height="138" border="0" style="float:left;margin-top:7px;margin-right:7px;" alt="No one knows where" /><strong>This multimedia website</strong> explores the history and consequences of the Seattle General Strike of 1919. Below you will find original research reports, oral histories, digitized newspaper articles and other important documents, photographs,  and extensive bibliographic materials. Start by watching a 4-minute video about the Seattle General Strike. This excerpt from <a href="video.shtml"><em>Witness to Revolution: The Story of Anna Louis Strong</em></a> contains original film footage from 1919. Produced and directed by Lucy Ostrander and used here with permission, the excerpt is part of an award-winning 27 minute documentary film biography of Anna Louise Strong, Seattle's most famous radical. Read with <a href="gold.shtml">Roberta Gold’s article</a> from the <em>Encyclopedia of Labor History Worldwide</em>    and <a href="http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/pioneerlife&CISOPTR=9191&REC=12">&quot;An Account of What Happened in Seattle and Especially in the Seattle Labor Movement, During the General Strike, February 6 To 11, 1919&quot; </a>written by Anna Louise Strong and members of the General Strike Committee.  Daren Salter has created a <a href="1919SeattleGeneralStrikeProject-show.pdf">dramatic slide shvvow</a> that tells the story of the strike with photos and headlines illustrating key events. </div>

    <p>Here is an interactive map the shows the location of important events and union headquarters in 1919. Use it to plan a walking tour of downtown Seattle. Here is a selection of <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/labpics/zenPhoto/1919_strike/General-Strike-photos/">fascinating photographs</a> from the strike. </p>
    <p>The <a href="http://content.lib.washington.edu/portals/law/strike.html" target="_blank">Labor Archives of Washington State</a> has digitized more than a hundred important documents from the strike, including pamphlets, minutes of strike committee meetings, IWW leaflets, and reports of agents hired to spy on labor activists.</p>

    <p>In 1977, Professor Rob Rosenthal interviewed 35 men and women who participated in or remembered the 1919 General Strike.   Rosenthal has generously agreed to share these <a href="interviews.shtml">oral histories</a> with the Seattle General Strike Project. These audio MP3 files and transcripts comprise a rare and valuable resource. The narrators speak not only about the events of 1919 but about later aspects of Pacific Northwest labor and political history. <strong>Dave Beck</strong> is the most famous of the men and women interviewed. Later to serve as President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Beck was 24 years old at the time of the General Strike, newly discharged from the Navy and was part of a group of Teamsters who opposed the strike.

In Seattle, the newspaper coverage was much more intense.

The reports that follow explore a variety of issues, including the role of the IWW in the strike; the  the way that the labor movement responded to women workers and to the African American community; how the national media covered the strike. In addition, there are reports on key unions and organizations like the right-wing Minutemen; reports on earlier  strikes; and biographical essays on Anna Louise Strong, Mayor Ole Hanson, and University of Washington President Henry Suzzallo.  Most were researched and written by senior History majors in  Professor James Gregory's History 498 courses or as Honors theses at the University of Washington.  The reports are described on the <a href="researchpapers.shtml">Research Papers</a> page. They are listed below.<br />

   <div class="heading">Commemorating the Strike</div>
 <div> <img src="images/cover-thumb.jpg" width="251" height="149" border="0" class="leftpic" alt="Album cover" />
 On February 7, 2009, the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies and the M.L. King County Labor Council hosted <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/pcls/genstrike.html" target="_blank">&quot;Celebrating Seattle's Strike History: 90th Anniversary of the Seattle General Strike&quot;</a> at the Seattle Labor Temple (click link for details and video) . Ten years earlier the University of Washington Library produced an online <a href="http://www.lib.washington.edu/exhibits/STRIKES!/exh.html" target="_blank">"Strikes!" exhibit </a>of rare photographs and documents to honor the 80th anniversary. Commemorations of this sort are an important part of the legacy of the Seattle General Strike. They show how the strike lives on, inspiring new generations to think about labor, social justice, and radical activism. One of the most important commemorative projects was the rock opera <a href="music.shtml" target="_blank"><em>Seattle 1919</em></a> which tells the story of the general strike in lyrics and music. Composed  by Rob Rosenthal, Seattle 1919 was recorded by the Fuse. The band performed the full rock opera in Seattle on May 1, 1989, shortly after the 70th anniversary of the strike. Here is <a href="music.shtml" target="_blank">more  about the rock opera</a> and you can listen to one of the songs. </div>
