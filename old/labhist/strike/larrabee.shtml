   <p>By  the late afternoon of July 19, 1913 the Seattle headquarters of the Industrial  Workers of the World lay in ruin.&nbsp; Along  with two Socialist Party offices and a Socialist newsstand, it had been looted  and its contents dumped into the street and burned by a mob of locals and  visiting sailors.&nbsp; The night before  the rioting began, throngs of tourists were in town for the Golden Potlatch  festival, when a street fight between some visiting military personnel and some  civilians became a full-scale brawl. The sailors, also&nbsp;  in town for the Golden Potlatch Festival, had become involved in a  shouting match with a group listening to a street speaker in Seattle&rsquo;s Pioneer  Square neighborhood. &nbsp;In an  exhaustive account of the riot for their biography of <em><u>Seattle Daily Times</u></em> editor Alden J. Blethen, Sharon Boswell and Lorraine McConaghy seem to agree  with the position of many contemporaries of the riot that it was caused by an  incendiary newspaper article written in the Times in which the brawl was blamed  on members of the I.W.W.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;</p>
                Whatever the cause, the day after the brawl, a large mob (accounts very from  several hundred to several thousand)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> began its rampage through the city, destroying anything related to the I.W.W. or  the socialist cause.&nbsp; The morning of  July 19th found the city under martial law, the federal government  calling for a full-scale investigation of the involvement of military personnel,  and the socialist community demanding federal money to rebuild and replace the  property and equipment that had been destroyed.&nbsp; The sailors in Seattle for  the Potlatch festivites were returned to their ships and the city braced itself  for the&nbsp; possibility of more violence.
   <p>The Seattle Golden Potlatch had grown out of the Seattle Yukon Exposition of  1909 into a regular yearly event. The Potlatch Festival celebrated Seattle&rsquo;s  maritime heritage and was used by local businessmen and boosters as a means of  getting Seattle some national attention.&nbsp; The  United States Navy would send a portion of its Pacific Fleet into Elliot Bay and  patriotic parades and speeches, along with auto and boat races drew spectators  from all over the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; The  festival also doubled as a shore leave for the hundreds of Navy personnel  serving on the craft that visited the bay.&nbsp;  The rowdiness of the sailors was legendary, and taverns and saloons in  Seattle did a rousing business with so many young men in town who had been at  sea for months at a time. In 1914, the year after the riot, the Potlatch  Festival was held with much less fanfare as memories of the destruction fueled  rumors about more attacks.&nbsp; The  event was discontinued after the 1914 celebration and did not return until 1934.  The Potlatch Festival was held sporadically during the depression years and  World War Two, but was renamed the Seafair Festival in 1950 and has taken place  every year since.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>
   <p>The  Potlatch Riot became infamous among the members of the Industrial Workers of the  World, not only because of the destruction of their Seattle headquarters and all  the property it contained, but also as an example of the bias against them by  the police and the military. Because much of the coverage in the local papers  explicitly blamed the I.W.W. for causing the riot, evidence to the contrary not  withstanding, it also became a focus of those members of the community who  claimed that the I.W.W. was a destabilizing element in Seattle.</p>
   <p>While  the aftermath of the riot and the actions that it inspired are relatively  straightforward, the brawl that immediately preceded it remains shrouded in  mystery. However, the importance of that event cannot be overstated, since it  was the catalyst for the mayhem that engulfed Seattle the next day.&nbsp; The accounts of the fight that appeared in local newspapers  differed widely from one another.&nbsp; These  differing accounts remained unresolved as the news of the riot replaced the  reporting on the fight, which was soon forgotten.&nbsp; Although a careful examination of these accounts does not  resolve the cause of the riot, it does give a glimpse into the diverse political  opinions held by the Seattle press and the community in general.&nbsp;  By focusing on this one small and particular event, it becomes easier to  see the deep divisions in the community over the place of patriotism, socialism,  and the rights of workers to gather and speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;Seattle  in the summer of 1913 was well served for a metropolis of its size by several  major newspapers that represented every point on the political compass.&nbsp;  For the purpose of this examination we will review the coverage of the  events that preceded the riot by five of these newspapers, <em><u>The Seattle  Daily Times</u></em>, <em><u>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</u></em>, <em><u>The  Seattle Sun</u></em>, <em><u>The Seattle Union Record</u></em> and <em><u>The  Commonwealth</u></em>. <em><u>The Seattle Star</u></em>, another mainstream daily  in circulation at the time of the riots will be left out, as it did not publish  any articles regarding the incidents that preceded the riot. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp;  While <em><u>The Commonwealth</u></em> was published in Everett rather than  Seattle, its designation as the official organ of the Washington State Socialist  Party makes its coverage important in light of the destruction that the riots  caused to that parties offices in Seattle. The huge disparities between the  reports from the different papers are a relatively accurate example of the wide  range of political opinions and loyalties in the Seattle of 1913.&nbsp;  Class divisions, what they meant, and how they should be dealt with was  much more a part of every day reporting in 1913 than it is today, and each paper  exemplified some of the major differences of opinion.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;The  treatment that each paper gave the event in question was undeniably colored by  their editorial opinion and the segment of the community that they catered to.&nbsp;  The labor and socialist press tended to focus on the violent nature of  the military personnel involved.&nbsp; This  is not altogether surprising considering that they represented different  interest groups than the mainstream dailies and therefore put decidedly  different spins on the event.&nbsp; However,  it should be made clear that the mainstream dailies examined here also had their  own agendas regardless of the fact that they did not openly support any specific  interest group.&nbsp; Of the three major  dailies, only <em><u>The Seattle Daily Times</u></em> and the <em><u>Post-Intelligencer</u></em> ran the story of the fight before the actual riot began and reported on it as  news in its own right. <em><u>The Sun</u></em> carried the event as part of its  coverage of the riot.&nbsp; <em><u>The  Commonwealth</u></em> and <em><u>The Union Record</u></em> were both published on a  weekly basis during the summer of 1913 and therefore had several days lapse  between the events and publication.&nbsp;</p>
   <p><em><u>The  Seattle Daily Times</u></em> in its  coverage of the event was undoubtedly the most creative of the papers involved.&nbsp;  Of the two stories printed concerning the fight on Occidental Avenue, <em><u>The  Times</u></em> account was the longest and most blatantly falsified.&nbsp; <em><u>The Seattle Daily Times</u></em> was the personal  editorial organ of Col. Alden Blethen, famous for both his brash style and his  total contempt for unionism and socialism in any form.&nbsp; Rather than run the fight story on its own, <em><u>The Times</u></em> wove it through a story on a speech given by the Secretary of the Navy the  previous evening at the prestigious Rainier Club.&nbsp; <em><u>The Times</u></em> twisted the Secretary&rsquo;s words into  a denunciation of the freedom of organization and even into a personal attack on  the mayor. <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> This patriotic chest thumping was intertwined with the story of the three  soldiers, who &ldquo; were strolling down Washington street&hellip;sober and conducting  themselves in a gentlemanly manner&hellip; when they were spotted by an I.W.W.  speaker&rdquo; at this point although &ldquo;their uniforms were decried&rdquo; and they  were &ldquo;stung to the quick by the insults which followed, the soldiers appeared  to pay no attention&rdquo;.&nbsp; At that  point the Times informs us that the crowd of I.W.W. rowdies, whipped into a  frenzy by the exhortations of the speaker, began to scream &ldquo;Get them&rdquo; and  &ldquo;To hell with the flag!&rdquo; and jumped on the soldiers.&nbsp;  One of the soldiers was attacked by &ldquo;two heavy lumberjacks&rdquo; and  anther &ldquo;gashed in several places by an I.W.W. with a small knife.&rdquo;  Eventually all three soldiers went down and &ldquo;the mob jumped on them with their  heavy shoes&rdquo;. <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>&nbsp;  The article goes on to interview some anonymous veterans about the  situation &ldquo;They [the I.W.W. members] will meet something they never did  before, our men will be armed with everything from bolos to head axes, and we  will be ready for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In closing the article, we are informed &ldquo;several soldiers  declared that they had never before heard of authorities in an American City  permitting public insults to be directed toward defenders of the nation and its  flag&rdquo;.&nbsp; The last statement is  perhaps the most ironic in the article, since the events that were to follow the  riot would lead to the Times loudly trumpeting that freedom of speech was not  being protected enough in Seattle.</p>
   <p>The <em><u>Seattle Post  Intelligencer</u></em> had a longer history in Seattle than did the other major  dailies, but it had changed ownership several times in the first few years of  the twentieth century and so lacked the editorial continuity that marked the <em><u>Seattle  Daily Times</u></em>. The paper had four different owners between 1893 and 1921  when it was purchased by William Randolph Hearst as the latest edition to his  growing media empire.&nbsp; <em><u>The  Post Intelligencer</u></em> also gave the fight story front-page coverage, but  only one column in the bottom right hand corner was given over to the event.&nbsp;  While the events that the P.I. reports are basically identical to the  story as told in the Times, the details that the story lacks are made  conspicuous by their absence.&nbsp; <em><u>The Post Intelligencer</u></em>&nbsp; notes that &ldquo; They [the soldiers] were walking down  Washington Street &hellip;they heard a woman speaker abusing the army and the  navy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the attack in  this account started much the same way, &ldquo; Suddenly a man in the crowd saw them  [the soldier] and shouted, &ldquo;there are three of the --- now.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> The article then reports that an unidentified assailant struck one of the  soldiers, beginning the fight.&nbsp; No  mention is made in this account of the I.W.W., lumberjacks, or other types that  would be associated with the working classes.&nbsp;  Any mentions of political affiliations of the men fighting with the  soldiers are also absent from <em><u>The Post Intelligencer</u></em> account.&nbsp; <em><u>The Post Intelligencer</u></em> agrees with <em><u>The Times</u></em> in that one of the soldiers involved in the fight was stabbed, but again, the  political affiliations of the individual doing the stabbing is not mentioned.&nbsp;  While <em><u>The Post Intelligencer</u></em> report lacks much of the  artistic license utilized in the jingoistic prose of the Times version, it does  make clear that the sole responsibility for the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e lie with the crowd and  the woman speaking. This portion of the story remains intact in all of the  accounts from the three mainstream dailies.&nbsp;  It is interesting to note however, that although the political  orientation of the woman and the crowd listening to her speak are not mentioned  outright as they are in the Times, the radical nature of the crowd can be easily  inferred from the strong anti-military statements they are reported by <em><u>The  Post Intelligencer</u></em>&nbsp; to have  been making.&nbsp; Although not as openly  hostile or loose with the facts as the reporting in <em><u>The Times </u></em>seemed  to be, the <em><u>The Post Intelligencer</u></em> nonetheless exonerates the  military personnel immediately.</p>
   <p><em><u>The  Seattle Sun</u></em>, a local daily that never missed an opportunity to lampoon <em><u>The  Times</u></em>&rsquo; Col. Blethen, was not as openly partisan as <em><u>The Times</u></em>,  but like the other mainstream dailies, did not question that the real cause of  the riots was the speakers that the Industrial Workers of the World sent out on  a regular basis.&nbsp; The Sun, like <em><u>The  Seattle Daily Times</u></em>, assumes that the street speaker was a member of the  I.W.W.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;<em><u>The  Seattle Sun</u></em> did not publish a detailed account of the incident between  the soldiers and the crowd on Washington Street, but their presentation of a  timeline of events is interesting.&nbsp; In  an article entitled &ldquo;Chronological  Summary Of Events In Riot Situation&rdquo; on the front page of the July 19th  edition, they present a summary of the main points of the last 48 hours. This  chronology is the only mention of the initial incident in the Sun.&nbsp; Rather than giving separate dates for the street brawl on the  17th and the riot on the 18th, The Sun gives the  impression that one event followed immediately on the heels of the next:</p>
   <p>1.Two  Sailors and two soldiers were badly beaten up after they objected to  remarks by an I.W.W. speaker on Washington Street.</p>
   <p>2.Rioting  Begins at Occidental Avenue and Washington Street.</p>
   <p>3.  All furnishings at I.W.W. headquarters at 211 Occidental Avenue are destroyed. <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></p>
   <p>It  seems likely that the riot referred to in the second point of the chronology is  the riot that occurred almost a full day after the incident with the soldiers.&nbsp;  This lack of context in the chronology presented by <em><u>The Sun</u></em> leaves out the twenty-four hour period in which the public had been made aware  of the incident between the military personnel and the crowd of locals.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>The  number of sailors or soldiers involved in the incident is perhaps the most fluid  detail between the accounts in the different papers, both mainstream and labor  or socialist.&nbsp; As the above  chronology states, two sailors and two soldiers, were involved in the initial  event. <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp;  As stated above, <em><u>The Times</u></em> mentions the three soldiers who  had been wandering down Washington Street<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> while <em><u>The Post Intelligencer</u></em> agrees that three soldiers had been  the first on the scene, but were immediately aided by two sailors. <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> However, in <em><u>The Union Record account</u></em>, it was only one intoxicated  sailor who was present initially, who then left the scene and returned with  eight or nine companions. <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></p>
   <p>The  three major dailies then, for the most part, all agree on the origin of the  altercation between the soldiers and the crowd at the intersection of Washington  and Occidental Streets. The much different account of the events of that evening  described by both <em><u>The Union Record</u></em> and <em><u>The Commonwealth</u></em> are not shocking considering the ideological differences between their editors  and those of the mainstream dalies As stated above, the reports of these papers  give a varied account from that of the mainstream dailies, not surprising given  their open support for labor and socialism respectively.&nbsp;  The more detailed accounts given in these publications could also have  been the result of the luxury of having had several days to look back over the  events, one that the daily papers could not have enjoyed.&nbsp;  However, the fact that the mainstream dailies never altered their  original accounts of the fight, never revisited the event, and certainly never  went so far as to print a retraction after more information was uncovered, shows  that the extra time in which the labor and socialist papers could gather  information on the incident played little or no part in their differing  accounts.</p>
   <p><em><u>The  Seattle Union Record</u></em> was essentially the organ of the Seattle Central  Labor Council, which was affiliated with the Washington State Federation of  Labor.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> Although the paper was edited by Harry Ault, a socialist who had edited more  radical newspapers in both Washington and Idaho, in general the paper was not as  radical as <em><u>The Commonwealth</u></em> and would not have automatically  supported the I.W. W.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>In  an article entitled &ldquo;Who Is To Blame&rdquo;  by Oscar McGill we are for the first time given details not just on the soldiers  involved, but on the identity of the woman who had been speaking when the  violence broke out, as well as a much different account of what type of  individuals incited the violence. <a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>&nbsp; McGill&rsquo;s  article states that the I.W.W. had &ldquo;not a single street meeting that night&rdquo;,  and his accounts of the actual confrontation are worlds apart from the coverage  we have already examined.&nbsp; <em><u>The  Seattle Union Record</u></em> reports that in an official affidavit, Mrs. Annie  Miller, the woman who had been addressing the crowd &ldquo;indicated that she was  not a member of the I.W.W. and was in fact speaking on woman&rsquo;s suffrage&rdquo;.&nbsp;  She goes on to report &ldquo;she was insulted by a sailor under the influence  of drink&rdquo;.&nbsp; The sailor left the  area of the meeting but soon &ldquo;returned with eight or nine companions who at  once took possession of the speaker&rsquo;s table&hellip;.scattering the books on sale,  cursing the I.W.W. and defying anyone to fight them&rdquo;.&nbsp;  It was when Mrs. Miller tried to gather her belongings that &ldquo;one of the  sailorsstruck at her fiercely with his fist and another laid hold upon  her clothing&rdquo;.&nbsp; During this  confrontation, a &ldquo;well dressed man, wearing a diamond ring called out, would  you strike a woman.&rdquo; According to <em><u>The Union Record</u></em>, this is the  point at which a brawl broke out between members of the crowd and the military  men.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a></p>
   <p>McGill&rsquo;s  article goes on to describe the events of the riot, closing with some  observations under the banner, &ldquo;The  Humor of the Situation&rdquo;.&nbsp; It  is under this banner that we see that, although his report vindicates the I.W.W.  from instigating the events that led up to the riot, <em><u>The Union Record</u></em> was far enough removed from the I.W.W. to poke a bit of fun even after the  ordeal that the organization had just been through.&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole episode is not without humor in that the I.W.W.,  who claim to believe in direct action and sabotage, should squeal when the shoe  pinches the otherfoot.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;The  position of the Union Record that the sailors were responsible for the riot is  called into question later in the same issue in an article by E.P. Marsh, the  President of the Washington State Federation of Labor.&nbsp;  Mr. Marsh readily shows that he is no friend of the more radical elements  of labor by laying the blame for the riots directly on the doorstep of the  I.W.W. regardless of whether or not they were involved in the events that led up  to it.&nbsp; In an article entitled &ldquo;What  Caused The Riot&rdquo;, Mr. Marsh ignores the report of events only two pages  prior and states, &ldquo; The primal cause [of the riot] must be put down as the  reckless, inexcusable street talking of the I.W.W. themselves&rdquo;.&nbsp;  Even more surprising than this is his outright denunciation of the right  of free speech where radicals are concerned. &ldquo; The right of free speech should  not include the right to declaimagainst law, government the flag,  etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; He closes his article with  a statement that exonerates the sailors for the destruction caused by the riot,  again laying the blame on the I.W.W.&nbsp; &ldquo;  Destruction of property is inexcusable when committed by capitalist hirelings or  by fanatical laborers, but in this case the sailors are less culpable than the  other parties concerned.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></p>
   <p><em><u>The  Commonwealth</u></em>, because of its position as the socialist party organ for  Washington State, was perhaps the most personally involved in the riot that  followed the street brawl since many of its subscribers and distributors had  lost property during the destruction of the riot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the I.W.W. headquarters was destroyed in the  riot, the brunt of the destruction was visited upon the socialist party offices  that were located throughout the city<em><u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Commonwealth</u></em>, like <em><u>The Seattle Union Record</u></em>,  was a weekly paper and therefore coverage of the events in question took place  in the July 24th edition. In an article entitled &ldquo;Cinders and Smoke&rdquo; by Bruce Rogers, the facts of the brawl  are given a treatment similar to that in The Union Record.&nbsp;  Rogers gives more detail about the lack of I.W.W. speakers on the street  on the night in question and reports that the I.W.W. had decided that it was  useless to attempt street propaganda at a time when the Potlatch Festival was  going on. <a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> This does not seem an unlikely scenario in light of the extreme prejudice  against them by the members of the military that were in Seattle in large  numbers for the festival.&nbsp; The  article also specifically mentions the &ldquo;Well dressed man wearing a diamond  ring&rdquo;, that was referred to in the Union Record.</p>
   <p>This  article by Rogers is also the only one that comments on the coverage of the  other newspapers that we have examined.&nbsp; He  states that the Sun and the Post-Intelligencer, because of their status as  privately owned corporations, lack the ability to credibly report on any events.&nbsp;  His special ire is however, reserved for the Seattle Daily Times and its  publisher, Alden Blethen in particular.&nbsp; He  describes Blethen as &ldquo;&hellip;an aged lunatic tottering toward a mad house of  bedlam and energetic fur, lashing himself with his wild imaginings and stinging  himself to death with the noisome venom of his ownhate&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>In the same edition, the Commonwealth published extracts of statements by  Seattle Mayor George Cotterill, some of which pertain to the incident in  question.&nbsp; In an article entitled  &ldquo;A Little More Light&rdquo;, the  mayor, alluding to the responsibility of the Seattle Daily Times for the ensuing  riot, states &ldquo;An ordinary drunken sailor street fight, occasioned by an attack  upon a harmless woman speaker, was quickly and thoroughly handled by the police  without serious injury to anyone&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a>&nbsp;  What concerns us here is not so much who the mayor holds responsible for  the riots, but his depiction of the instigating event.&nbsp;  The mayor&rsquo;s statements were made before the publication of either the  Union Record or the Commonwealth, giving the impression that his description of  the events, as it varies so greatly from that in any of the major dailies, was  based on knowledge that must have been available in the hours or days  immediately following the riot.&nbsp; This  makes more glaring the omission from the dailies of any attempt to revisit the  fight on the evening of the seventeenth.</p>
   <p>The Potlatch Riots that occurred in July of 1913 were by no means the first  instance of reporting discrepancies between the different papers that served  Seattle during the turbulent decades that opened the twentieth century, and they  certainly weren&rsquo;t the last.&nbsp; The  Pacific Northwest remained a stronghold for socialist thought and labor ideology  for many years, and in a town built on big industry like lumber and shipping  that always made for confrontation between competing interests. The coverage of  the fight is especially enlightening in that it concerns a specific event, and  because of that, it gives us the unique opportunity to examine the power that  newspapers had in an age when they were the primary form of public discourse.&nbsp;  The one obvious commonality between all the papers is that rather than  just reporting on the event, they had an overwhelming desire to mold the  opinions of their readers. Because their methods were often not as sophisticated  as those employed by&nbsp; journalists  currently, the manipulation of the story seemed much more commonplace. Perhaps  because ninety years ago the editorial opinions of many of the newspapers were  so blatantly woven throughout the news they reported that one could not miss the  slant when examining the paper with even the slightest bit of scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>More importantly, the Potlatch Riot also made clear to the Industrial Workers of  the World and the socialist community that even in a city as sympathetic to  their cause as Seattle the need for vigilance was great. The police had failed  to protect their property, and the instigators of the crimes were back on their  ships headed out to sea.&nbsp; The uneasy  peace between the labor, socialist, and capitalist elements of the growing  region remained in place, but the Potlatch Riots showed just how tenuous that  peace was, and the divisions only grew deeper in the years to come.</p>
