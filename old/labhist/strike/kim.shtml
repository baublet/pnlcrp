   </div>
   <p>Before  the World War I, women typically played the role of the homemaker.&nbsp;  Women were judged by their beauty rather than by their ability.&nbsp;  Their position and status were directed towards  maintaining  the annual duties of the family and children.&nbsp;  These duties consisted of cleaning and caring for the house, caring  for the young, cooking for the family, maintaining a yard, and sewing  clothing for all.&nbsp; Women had  worked in textile industries and other industries as far back as 1880, but had  been kept out of heavy industries and other positions involving any real responsibility.&nbsp;  Just before the war, women began  to break away from the traditional roles they had played.</p>
   <p>As men left their jobs to serve their  country in war overseas,  women replaced their jobs.&nbsp; Women  filled many jobs  that were brought into existence by wartime needs.&nbsp;  As a result, the number of women employed greatly  increased in many industries.&nbsp; In  the U.S. there were,  before the war, over eight million women in paid occupations.&nbsp; After the war began, not only did their numbers increased in common  lines of work, but as one newspaper stated, &ldquo;There has been a sudden influx of women  into such unusual occupations as bank clerks, ticket sellers, elevator operator,  chauffeur, street car conductor, railroad trackwalker, section hand, locomotive  wiper and oiler, locomotive dispatcher, block operator, draw bridge attendant,  and employment in machine shops, steel mills, powder and ammunition factories,  airplane works, boot blacking and farming.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;  Many of these women were married, and some were mothers whose husbands or  older sons had gone to front.&nbsp;  Women were also seen as vital resources for wartime  aids, and various wartime slogans such as &ldquo;You should aid nation in the war&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> and &ldquo;Everyone has to be a helper&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> emphasized patriotism and created the environment for women&rsquo;s active  involvement in many industries.&nbsp; By  looking through various newspapers including the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the  Seattle Times,  dated from 1917 to 1918 as my main primary sources for the research, I began  to understand the role that women played during World War I.</p>
   <p><strong><u>A.  General feminine  jobs </u></strong></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even though many women were  in high demand  for  industries where previously men were dominant, long-established feminine jobs  were still common during the war.&nbsp; The  Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Seattle Times had a full listing of open  positions  for general housework and other general domestic jobs.&nbsp; The war actually created more domestic jobs because many  women who worked in factories and outside their homes were not able to care well  enough for their children.&nbsp; Help  wanted ads and situation wanted ads looking for general housework were very easy  to find in newspaper &ldquo;help  wanted&rdquo;  sections.&nbsp; Ads such as: &ldquo;Widow: 40; very good  appearance, whose only support has gone to war would like some light work to  help out&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> and &ldquo;Wanted &ndash; Reliable neat school girl to assist general housework. Nice  home&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> were evidence for the fact that there were many women, regardless of age and status, who  were willing to work, either to help nation to win the war or to sustain the life of  their family in absence of their husband and father.</p>
   <p><strong><u>B. Increase  in war  emergency jobs </u></strong></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As more and more men were drafted and had to leave their jobs, the U.S. government and various  industries were seriously looking for female workers who could replace their  men&rsquo;s jobs.&nbsp; Especially during  1917 and 1918, there were a vast number of demands for female stenographers,  telegraphers, and phone operators.&nbsp; The  Women&rsquo;s Defense League was also placing a lot of effort to fill the gap.&nbsp;  Potential telegraphers had to learn the code  through memorization or by familiarizing themselves to carry out their work  efficiently.&nbsp; One newspaper wrote, &ldquo;Women are more apt than  men in this line of work.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>&nbsp;  The various railroad companies of the country employed hundred of capable  women operators, because they were known to be not only  skillful, but also dependable.&nbsp; In  many newspapers, ads looking for stenographers and other clerical works were  increasing over time.&nbsp; In  &ldquo;situation  wanted&rdquo;  sections of  the newspapers, two thirds of the total ads were looking for female  stenographers, an example being, &ldquo;Thoroughly competent bookkeeper, cashier, and  stenographer, six years with last firm in charge of books and collections,  desire position of responsibility.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>&nbsp;  Evident in this ad, women were willing to take  more responsible jobs and were becoming not just a substitute labor  force, but skillful workers.&nbsp; The  government was also in need of thousands of wartime positions open to women to work as  government clerks, stenographers, and telegraphers.</p>
   <p><strong><u>C.  Red Cross, Patriotic League, and YWCA</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Organizations  such as the Red Cross, Patriotic League, and YWCA also made efforts in supporting wartime  hardships  that the  nation might  face.&nbsp; The Red Cross organized non-professional  women to aid in relief work.&nbsp; To  help the war effort, many women joined the Red Cross as nurses. While they were  in the Red Cross, they rolled bandages, knitted socks, and worked in military  hospitals. &nbsp;Most of the women were  wives and mothers of soldiers of all classes.&nbsp;  The Red Cross war council also created a women&rsquo;s bureau, which appointed a national advisory  committee of women that made an effort to recruit every available woman in the campaign to  make adequate funds and supplies. &nbsp;Women  in the Red Cross were also helpful in recruiting men who had not joined the war.  &nbsp;One method was by showing a man in civilian clothes with  white feathers as a mark of cowardice. &nbsp;Another method was by making women speak at public meetings,  encouraging others to have nothing to do with men who had not joined the war. &nbsp;Women  also went over seas as members of the  Voluntary Aid Detachment of the Red Cross. &nbsp;Volunteering brought them out of the house and into the public. &nbsp;Women  had no trouble filling the gaps left by  men who went to war.&nbsp; The Red Cross  continued to encourage many women to join the Red Cross by saying  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the patriotic duty of every man, woman, and child to join the Red  Cross.&nbsp; Why wait to be asked?&nbsp; Be  a volunteer.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></p>
   <p>The  Patriotic League also organized girls for wartime activities.&nbsp;  A branch of the Patriotic League, the National Organization for Girls,  which was active in social service work and war services.&nbsp; It was organized in  Seattle in 1918 to organize the city&rsquo;s patriotic girls for real war  activities.&nbsp; An editorial piece in  the Seattle Argus newspaper covered the story of young girls who had  donated bed shirts to the Red Cross with the money that they had made at work.&nbsp;  One article pointed out that, &ldquo;Hundreds &ndash;  Probably thousands are doing their utmost to help win the war.&nbsp;  They are the private soldiers.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp;  Girls and women were soldiers armed with patriotism and hard work.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Young Women Christian Association&rsquo;s  northwestern field committee was also concerned with the needs of the war.&nbsp; The committee occasionally discussed the great increase in the  duties of employment agencies of the YWCA because of the war.  &nbsp;In  those discussions they came to the conclusion that training girls to take the  place of the men was necessary.&nbsp; One  newspaper wrote, &ldquo;The  necessity of training girls to take the place of men, and also work in  connection with the hostess houses at Camp Lewis, Vancouver barracks and  Bremerton, has made as many demands upon the Northwest.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>&nbsp;  Further advancement in the development of  women&rsquo;s work was strengthened by the withdrawal of millions of men from the  American industry.</p>
   <p><strong><u>D.  Non-traditional jobs</u></strong></p>
   <p>Before  the wartime, it was unusual in this country for women to enroll in  higher courses of mathematics because the women&rsquo;s role wasn&rsquo;t to work in  male dominated industries.&nbsp; Therefore, getting  higher education and obtaining specific skills wasn&rsquo;t a common road that most women followed.&nbsp;  During World War I, however, women worked in virtually every field of  industry.&nbsp; Newspapers started to cover more women&rsquo;s work related  articles, help ads, and spoke out about women&rsquo;s great successes in education, sports, and various  other areas in society.&nbsp; There  was the example of an Argentinean woman who had become a civil engineer, and was praised in U.S. newspapers,  showing the development of women&rsquo;s statuses visible through the period of war.&nbsp;  Women were replacing men&rsquo;s job such as railroad workers, auto drivers, and other machine operators.&nbsp;  One newspaper noted that 4,000 women were  working for the Pennsylvania Railroad.&nbsp; &ldquo;In  five months, the number increased from 1,494 to 3,700.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a>&nbsp;  One newspaper I read had several articles about women  railroad workers&rsquo; accounts.&nbsp; Some  of them discussed  the need for  women workers on the railroads, whereas some of the articles were talking  about the disagreement between employers and women employees due to the unequal  pay and  poor working conditions, even though they performed the same type of jobs that men had  done before they went to the war.&nbsp; Women  were,  &ldquo;wielding picks and shovels on the American Railroad because of shortage of men  for work.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a>&nbsp;  Some women track workers also maintained the  roadbed of the Pennsylvania Railroad between New York and Pittsburgh.&nbsp;  The President of the company, &ldquo;&hellip;testified before  the Interstate Commerce Commission, gave this example of the difficulties the railroads  faced  in holding their men (due to the draft).&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a>&nbsp;  Women also held many jobs besides working in factories that were traditional men&rsquo;s&rsquo; work. &nbsp;They  assumed positions of doctors, lawyers, bankers, and civil servants. &nbsp;Harvesting  grain, running  businesses,  and driving trucks were all common jobs for women to take. &nbsp;Because  of the war demands, the  role of women changed and they had new attitudes.&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong><u>Working  conditions of female workers</u></strong> </p>
   <p>By  the late 1918, so many men went to war that women had to take over their  jobs. Labor unions fought hard against hiring women in factories. Women were  paid half the wages of men and worked in conditions that were sometimes dangerous and  unhealthy. &nbsp;In  munitions plants,  acid fumes from high explosives damaged workers&rsquo; lungs. &nbsp;In  addition,  it also turned their skin bright yellow. &nbsp;Thousands  of women worked long hours filling shells with explosives.  &nbsp;Accidental explosions were  always a risk. &nbsp;Little  effort was made to ease the change from working in the home to the work place. &nbsp;Few  employers provided childcare for working mothers or even set aside toilets for  female workers.&nbsp;  Female workers  were also less unionized than male workers, &ldquo;This was because they tended to do part-time  work and to work in smaller firms, which tended to be less unionized.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> Also, existing unions were often hostile to female workers. &nbsp; </p>
   <p>Feminist  pressure on established unions and the formation of separate women's unions threatened to weaken men-only unions. &nbsp;Still,  women&rsquo;s unions began to grow, &ldquo;The National Women&rsquo;s Trade Union League  representing 150,000 organized working women have met together for counsel and  for action.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a>&nbsp;  However, the war did not raise women's wages. &nbsp;Employers  got around wartime equal pay policies  by employing several women to replace one man, or by dividing skilled tasks into  several less skilled stages. &nbsp; </p>
   <p><strong><u>Military  auxiliary jobs </u></strong></p>
   <p><strong><u>A.  Nursing </u></strong></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Young women and girls worked  as nurses during World War I.&nbsp; Help wanted ads looking for nurses increased as days passed  by, &ldquo;Girl: 16 years, wants a position as a nurse.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a>&nbsp;  When the United  States entered World War I in April 1917, the Navy had 160 nurses on active  duty.&nbsp;  Over the next year and a half, this number increased more than eight-fold as the Nurse Corps expanded to meet the  war's demands,  &ldquo;Growth  was gradual, with 345 Navy Nurses serving by mid-1917, 155 of them members of  the U.S. Naval Reserve Force.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a>&nbsp;  Young women volunteered to join the  Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) and First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY).&nbsp;  VAD's came from a variety of backgrounds: cooks, domestic servants,  laundry workers etc. &nbsp;Their  medical training was basic,  but the fact that they went to the war zone meant that they could help badly  wounded soldiers and give them basic medical treatment.&nbsp; VAD's  did not get paid, as it was a voluntary appointment. &nbsp;Those  who joined the FANY's had a less thrilling time than VAD&rsquo;s. &nbsp;They  had to drive an ambulance and run soup kitchens for the soldiers and  helped to organize baths for those soldiers given some time off from the front  line. </p>
   <p><strong><u>B. The Women&rsquo;s Land Army</u></strong> </p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With so many men away  fighting, someone had to bring in the harvests and keep the farms going. &nbsp;The  government decided that more women would have to become more involved in  producing food and goods to support their war effort.&nbsp;  The Women's Land Army played a crucial role in doing this when the men who would normally work on  the farms never returned or returned disabled from the war.&nbsp;  One of the comments made by women in the WLA was that, &ldquo;Their feet were never dry even in dry weather - simply because  they had to work early in the morning and the dew on the grass would enter the  boots through the lace holes.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a>&nbsp; </p>
   <p><u><strong>C.  Factory Workers</strong></u></p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some of the most important work done by women was in the ammunition factories. &nbsp;With  the young men away fighting, this very important work was done by women. &nbsp;It  was very dangerous to work with explosive chemicals because it meant that one explosion in a  factory could trigger many other ones.&nbsp; Not  only women worked in ammunition factories but they also worked as power machine  operators and in naval station machine shops as well.&nbsp; One example being, &ldquo;Authority to employ women for work in  the various shops at the navy yard has been received from Washington D.C. and  according to commandant of the naval station, the majority of 1,000 employees  for shop work, for whom calls are now out, will be women.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a>&nbsp;  They were used to some extent in all of the shops, but most of the time  the women employees worked in the machinery, supply, and public works  departments.&nbsp; Other manufacturing  industries were also in need of female power machine operators due to the lack  of male workers.&nbsp; In effort to  supply more skilled female workers into factories, schools had been set up to  train women in upholstering, trimming, and other work calling for skilled  operatives.&nbsp; One factory manager was  quoted as saying, &ldquo;Women were seen as quick learners and that in some  departments they are more efficient than men, although those departments have  been employing men exclusively for years.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a> </p>

    <strong><strong>Conclusion</strong>
     <!--mstheme-->
    </strong>
    <!--mstheme-->
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  World War I  was to give women a chance to show a male-dominated  society that they could do more than simply bring up children and stay  at  home. &nbsp;In  World War I, women played a vital role in keeping  soldiers equipped with ammunition and in many senses they kept the nation moving  through their help in various industries.&nbsp;  With so many young men volunteering to join the army, and with so many  casualties in the  war, a space was created in employment and women were called on to fill  these gaps.  &nbsp;World War I was to prove a turning point for women.  &nbsp;Before  the war, women had no socio-economic  power at all. &nbsp;By  the end of the war, women had proved that they were just as important to the war  effort as men had been. &nbsp;Women  found employment in transportation including the railroads and driving cars, ambulances,  and trucks, nursing, factories making ammunition, on farms in the Women's Land  Army, in shipyards etc. Before the war, these jobs had been for men only with  the exception of nursing. </p>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As time passed by, I could  see the progress how women began to earn a great deal of respect through their  active participation in labor and society during the wartime crisis.&nbsp;  The views seen and the voices heard through these old newspapers that I  researched showed a clear trend of a more broad and accepting women&rsquo;s role in  America.&nbsp; Women finally had the  opportunity to show the world that they had just as much to contribute and had  the right to take on as much responsibility as the men.</p>
