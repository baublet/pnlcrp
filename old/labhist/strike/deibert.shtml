 <div class="subheading"><strong> </strong>Washington State&rsquo;s 1911 Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act:<br> 
  A Look at the Newspaper Coverage</div>
 <br>
 <div>
   <em>By Ryan Deibert  </em><br>
   <p>Public health professionals are currently making renewed calls for the    protection of workers&rsquo; health through broad population health measures,<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a> and labor leaders are calling for the continued participation of organized    labor as a key player in the reshaping of health services policy to remedy the    American health care crisis.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>&nbsp;    These current efforts draw on a legacy of labor unions&rsquo; participation    in the creation and protection of health care services for American workers    through policy advocacy, collective bargaining with employers, the formation    of health insurance collectives and mutual aid societies, and development of    workers&rsquo; compensation laws.&nbsp; Leading    up to and during the twelfth session of the Washington State Legislature from    January through March, 1911, representatives of organized labor in Washington    worked with leaders of industry and state political leaders to pass one of the    earliest state-level workers&rsquo; compensation acts in the United States.&nbsp; Progressive lawmakers, industry and labor leaders, and social    commentators touted the legislation as some of the most progressive state    legislation passed during the period.<a name="_Ref41833345"></a><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Many of the mainstream and labor newspapers throughout the Puget Sound region    of Washington State reported on the events leading to the passage of the    legislation, though the coverage and editorial opinions relating to the    legislation varied significantly.&nbsp; I    will present a comparative summary of newspaper coverage of the passage and    early implementation of Washington State&rsquo;s 1911 workmen&rsquo;s compensation law    with discussion regarding representations of political and economic interests    of the editorial staff, ownership, and intended readership of the newspapers    represented.&nbsp; </p>
   <p><strong>Background    and General Timeline</strong></p>
   <p>Between 1890 and 1910,    economic development in Washington State was fueled primarily by extractive    industries, particularly the booming lumber industry, which employed in 1910    nearly seventy-five percent of all workers in the state.&nbsp;    Industrial accidents were common among workers in the logging industry,    and a general progression of court rulings in employer liability cases shifted    from conservative common-law-based rulings that placed heavy burdens on    employees to prove employer negligence to more liberal rulings with increasing    favor toward injured workers and subsequent awarding of large damage claims.&nbsp;    This movement gave rise to increasing industry concern toward    settlement of employee injury claims through established legal processes.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Though less than ten percent of injured workers chose to sue and only ten    percent of claims prosecuted in 1910 were successful, court costs for    injury-related suits totaled more than $100,000 annually; half of all court    time was spent in damage suits; and insurance rates for employers were rising    rapidly.&nbsp; Even in successful    suits, injured workers rarely received large awards, as sixty percent of the    damages were retained by insurance companies for administrative costs, and    three-quarters of the remaining amount generally went to lawyer&rsquo;s fees.&nbsp;    The legal process for settling injury claims increasingly drew the ire    of industry and workers alike, and by 1910 the governor of Washington, Marion    Hay, leaders from the Pacific Coast Lumber Manufacturer&rsquo;s Association,    Washington State Federation of Labor representatives, and representatives of    other industrial and labor organizations began working toward compromise-based    solutions.</p>
   <p>From a large assembly of policy makers, businessmen, and labor leaders,    Governor Hay appointed an Employers&rsquo; Liability Commission to draft a bill on    workmen&rsquo;s compensation.&nbsp; This    commission consisted of a timber industry representative, Paul Page, a coal    miner, Peter Henretty, and a labor-friendly attorney, Harold Preston.&nbsp;    The commission drafted legislation, which was introduced at the    beginning of the 1911 Washington legislative session as House Bill 14, &ldquo;An    act relating to the compensation of injured workers in our industries,&rdquo; by    Govnor Teats, a populist representative from Tacoma elected on the Republican    ticket. </p>
   <p>The Teats bill would establish a state-administered fund to which all    employers in hazardous occupations would be mandated to contribute in    proportion to the relative hazard posed to the workers of that industry.&nbsp;    The fund would be used to award compensation to any workers injured in    industrial accidents regardless of fault or liability.&nbsp;    Proponents argued that, if enacted, the bill would increase awards paid    to injured workers, free courts of expensive litigation, make costs to    employers predictable, and improve labor relations throughout the state.&nbsp;    Early debate in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives    focused on the contentious first aid provision of the bill, which required    employers and employees to contribute to a fund for coverage of medical costs    incurred following an accidental injury.&nbsp;    The first aid provision was struck from the bill, and the amended bill    passed the House on February 22 by a vote of sixty-nine to twenty-four.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>As debate progressed to the Republican-dominated Senate, two substitute bills    known as the Metcalf and Collins bills were introduced and later consolidated    into the Metcalf bill.&nbsp; The    alternative bills proposed elective rather than mandatory employer    participation in the compensation fund by allowing employers to choose payment    to the state compensation fund or continued liability coverage through private    insurers.&nbsp; Favored primarily by    small employers in urban areas, the Metcalf bill was defeated after aggressive    lobbying from organized labor and powerful industry representatives.&nbsp;    The Teats bill was subsequently passed by the Senate and signed into    law as the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Law by Governor Hay in March, 1911. </p>
   <p><strong>Press coverage of the process</strong></p>
   <p>In Seattle and other Washington cities, labor and mainstream press    dutifully covered the legislative session in Olympia.&nbsp; Stories regarding the legislative movement of the workmen&rsquo;s    compensation bill appeared in the Seattle dailies, the <em>Seattle Daily Times</em>, <em>Seattle    Post-Intelligencer</em>, and <em>The Star</em>,    and limited coverage appeared in the Olympia weekly, the <em>Washington Standard</em> (though archival records are missing several    issues during the latter portion of the legislative session). The Seattle    Central Labor Council&rsquo;s weekly <em>Seattle    Union Record</em>, frequently reported on several important labor bills    advanced during the progressive legislative session, including the workmen&rsquo;s    compensation bill and a bill that would establish an eight-hour work day for    women. Despite one researchers insistence that the threat of the increasing    influence of the Industrial Workers of the World among Northwest lumber    workers helped to spur political leaders&rsquo; interest in working with the less    radical Washington State Federation of Labor to pass workmen&rsquo;s compensation    legislation,3 there is no mention of the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation    Act and its political preludes in the Spokane-based IWW newspaper, the <em>Industrial    Worker</em>, during the months in which the law is created. </p>
   <p>Beginning in early    February, 1911, the <em>Union Record</em> was    reporting a positive outlook for labor legislation in Olympia.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv]</a>&nbsp;    One article reports on proceedings of a joint committee of both houses    in which Govnor Teats shrewdly elicited support in principle for the    workmen&rsquo;s compensation bill from multiple industry representatives who    feared, &ldquo;that to oppose the principle would give a wrong impression, such as    an interest in some insurance agency.&rdquo;&nbsp;    The article also notes the surprising enthusiastic support of the    lawyer testifying on behalf of the Northern Pacific Railroad.&nbsp;    The support of industry was moving into place, and the reporter notes    generally, &ldquo;I believe I can say that we have many friends at this session    and that we will secure more labor legislation than at any previous    session.&rdquo; </p>
   <p>Later in the month, the    debate begins to receive its first coverage in the daily press, with the <em>Post-Intelligencer</em> offering balanced coverage of the debate leading up to and the outcome of the    vote against the first aid clause of the Teats bill.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[v]</a>&nbsp;    Noting that all members were called to the House for a roll-call vote    and &ldquo;with both sides fighting aggressively,&rdquo; the reporter records the    primary arguments for the clause as argued by Teats (that the fund would    create hospitals for workingmen across the state) and against the clause as    argued by Representative Beach (that the clause would &ldquo;enable the governor    to build a mammoth political machine, with the thousands of employees of the    hospitals, and with the millions of money which would be placed in the hands    of a commission of his appointment and subject to his removal.&rdquo;). </p>
   <p>In a front-page article on    the same date, editorial comments lay out the decidedly more populist leanings    of <em>The Star</em>: &ldquo;The Star is content    and happy to represent that great body of honest, industrious men and women    whose interests and whose welfare are either ignored or abused by other    newspapers.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[vi]</a> Early coverage of the Teats Bill correspondingly reflects these leanings,    reporting that &ldquo;the house of representatives yesterday was buffaloed by the    minority.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[vii]</a> Painting the vote as an underhanded success by Speaker of the House, Howard    Taylor, &ldquo;employer and capitalist,&rdquo; the article suggests that    representatives voting against the clause were fooled by Taylor&rsquo;s argument    that the hospitals established under the clause would care only for the    injured and exclude the sick. </p>
   <p>Two days later, the <em>PI</em> again reports &ldquo;spirited conflict&rdquo; surrounding the bill as it is passed    quickly through the lower house.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[viii]</a>&nbsp;    The article suggests that opponents of the bill may have moved quickly    to pass it in the House to allow more debate against it in the Senate.&nbsp;    No other dailies report on the passage of the bill in the House, but    the <em>Union Record</em> notes the progress    of the bill in its weekly Saturday edition, with specific coverage regarding    the elimination of the first-aid clause after a successful role-call vote for    the amendment which followed an unsuccessful first vote with fifteen House    members absent.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[ix]</a>,<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[x]</a>&nbsp;    The addition of this detail in the <em>Union    Record</em> and its exclusion elsewhere is notable, and the coverage presents a    more leftist version of the debate, stating, &ldquo;The first aid clause in the    bill was intended to protect those inable [<em>sic</em>]    to protect themselves more than to protect men with organizations behind them    able to enforce the fulfillment of agreements.&rdquo;&nbsp;    An editorial in the same edition notes that &ldquo;While the elimination of    the first aid clause . . . will not work a hardship on members of organized    labor in hazardous occupations, it will leave the unorganized at the mercy of    unscrupulous corporations and physicians who cater to the corporations.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[xi]</a> The <em>PI</em> begins coverage of the Senate    debate the same day, reporting a &ldquo;wordy clash&rdquo; between representatives of    three &ldquo;badly split&rdquo; salons within the Senate, including advocates of the    Teats bill and supporters of the alternate Collins and Metcalf bills.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[xii]</a> </p>
   <p>At the end of the following week, the <em>PI</em>, <em>Star</em>, and <em>Union Record</em> all write regarding the progress of the bill in the    Senate.&nbsp; A <em>Star</em> summary article of activities in Olympia describes that the    Senate will again take up debate of the three competing proposals for the    workmen&rsquo;s compensation act, noting that the Teats bill would provide    compensation without litigation while both competing proposals would make a    court trial necessary.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[xiii]</a>&nbsp;    The <em>Union Record</em> publishes on    its front page an open letter from the Chas. R. Chase, president of the State    Federation of Labor and Peter Henretty of the Governor&rsquo;s Employees    Compensation Commission addressed to &ldquo;All Wage Workers of the State of    Washington.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[xiv]</a>&nbsp;    The letter details the history and intent of the Teats bill, noting    that opposition to the first aid clause &ldquo;was grounded on the evils of the    present system, of collecting one dollar or more a month as hospital fees from    employes [<em>sic</em>] and not giving them    care when injured&rdquo; and urging workers to contact Senators in support of the    Teats bill.&nbsp; Another <em>Union    Record</em> article reporting on legislative action in Olympia noted that    &ldquo;lumber, mining, and labor interests are supporting [the Teats bill], and    casualty companies, chambers of commerce, and the Metal Trades Association    opposing it.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[xv]</a>&nbsp;    The <em>PI </em>continues its    decidedly centrist stance regarding the separate versions of Senate    legislation, but expresses support for &ldquo;the very important subject of an    employer&rsquo;s liability law&rdquo; in a lengthy editorial.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[xvi]</a>&nbsp;    The editorial notes that the U.S. lagged behind Europe with respect to    worker&rsquo;s compensation and acknowledges: &ldquo;That some form of employer&rsquo;s    liability law and workingman&rsquo;s insurance is needed in this country is    admitted on all sides.&rdquo;&nbsp; The    editors conclude that the competing Teats, Collins, and Metcalf bills all have    associated merits and faults and that &ldquo;If it is possible, the good features    of all of the bills should be combined,&rdquo; though they do not expressly state    which features they consider good. </p>
   <p>The next week saw the most    active Senate debate around the competing bills, with final defeat of the    combined Collins and Metcalf bill and passage of the Teats bill on March 8,    1911.&nbsp; This activity was    accompanied by a flurry of reports detailing the debates and passage. </p>
   <p>In front and second-page stories, the <em>PI</em> filed extensive neutral reports detailing the combination of the Metcalf and    Collins bills, &ldquo;hot words exchanged&rdquo; during lengthy debate and filibuster    sessions, and the stated arguments for and against each bill made by Senators    during a special night session.<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[xvii]</a>,<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[xviii]</a>&nbsp;    The majority of the March 8th issue is missing from archival    records, but an article two days later provides a list of all legislation    passed during the 1911 session and notes as one of the &ldquo;more important items    on the record&rdquo; that the legislature, &ldquo;passed a workmen&rsquo;s compensation    act under which the state insures compensation for accidents.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[xix]</a>&nbsp;    The next day&rsquo;s editorial states: &ldquo;The legislature which has just    adjourned accomplished much good.&nbsp; It    enacted a number of really progressive laws.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[xx]</a>&nbsp;    Though the editors detail several areas in which they assessed failure    on the part of the legislators to pass important legislation, they do not    specify which &ldquo;progressive and wholesome laws&rdquo; they praise the legislature    for enacting.&nbsp; Given their    extensive coverage related to the workmen&rsquo;s compensation bills, it is safe    to assume that the editors would have included the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation    Act in their praise. </p>
   <p>The <em>Seattle    Daily Times</em> ended its relative silence on coverage of the legislative    session --It had not previously reported on the progression of the workmen&rsquo;s    compensation bills -- and printed a series of articles largely critical of the    legislature and its discussion of the workmen&rsquo;s compensation bills beginning    March 4th.&nbsp; While other    dailies were reporting the Senate debates relating to the Teats and Metcalf    bills, the <em>Times</em> reported that    &ldquo;there is little important legislation at stake in the last four days [of    the legislative session].&rdquo;<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[xxi]</a>&nbsp;    Though the reporter mentions legislation to establish the eight-hour    day for women and workmen&rsquo;s compensation legislation in passing, most of the    article is devoted to discussion of appropriations and roads bills.&nbsp;    A two-paragraph story tucked deep in the next day&rsquo;s <em>Times</em> notes that discussion of the competing Teats, Metcalf, and Collins bills has    been set aside in lieu of discussion of other business.<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[xxii]</a>&nbsp;    On March 7th, an article titled &ldquo;Senate Quits Work to    Attend Banquet&rdquo; details some of the debate relative to the competing bills,    though the reporter dismisses the work as &ldquo;a day of indecision and    procrastination.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[xxiii]</a>&nbsp;    Apparently more concerned with the Senate&rsquo;s adjournment for a    banquet, the article highlights disagreement over Senate procedure above the    content of debate.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>The <em>Times</em> reporting of the    passage of the Teats bill decidedly favored coverage of the defeated    supporters of the Metcalf and Collins bills.&nbsp;    Under the subheading &ldquo;Declares Act Means Tax on Industries,&rdquo; a    page-nine article fully reports in lengthy quotations the constitutional and    economic arguments offered against the Teats bill.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[xxiv]</a>&nbsp;    Quoting opponent Senator Ruth, the article warns that the bill &ldquo;will    drive manufacturing men out of the state and bring about an unprecedented    panic in manufacturing circles.&rdquo;&nbsp; On    March 10, the <em>Times</em> printed the text of the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act in its    entirety,<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[xxv]</a> and the March 12    editorial by conservative capitalist and <em>Times</em> owner Colonel Blethen was scathing: </p>
   <blockquote>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p>&ldquo;For absolute          disregard of duty -- of the best interests of the public -- and for the          creation of burdensome laws and the squandering of the public moneys --          the Twelfth Legislature of Washington surpasses all the efforts made          along these lines by the preceding eleven legislative bodies which have          met since Washington became a state . . . [The Employer&rsquo;s Liability          law] places a burden upon the industries of this Commonwealth that will          break many of them -- entirely destroy the profits of others and will          prevent new capital entering the state at all.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[xxvi]</a> </p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Calling the law &ldquo;the worst the legislature enacted,&rdquo; Blethen carefully    explains his calculations that estimated the total cost of the legislation to    be more than four-million dollars to the industries of King County alone,    justification, he insisted, for his dire economic predictions.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Dramatically contrasting <em>Times</em> coverage, <em>The Star</em> published    front-page stories framing the Senate debate as a &ldquo;war&rdquo; between labor and    the &ldquo;selfish interest&rdquo; of casualty companies and other &ldquo;enemies of    labor.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[xxvii]</a> The story suggests that differences between the Collins and Metcalf bills were    minimal, with the competing bills being introduced solely as means to defeat    the Teats bill.&nbsp; The passage of    the Teats bill brought another front-page story summarizing the key points of    the legislation, and garnering explicit editorial praise: &ldquo;Washington stands    today as the leader of all sovereign states in the world in the matter of    providing just compensation for its vast army of workingmen.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[xxviii]</a>&nbsp;    The following day, the paper reported: &ldquo;From the standpoint of    results, the [12th legislative] session will go down in the annals    of the state as the most progressive yet held.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[xxix]</a> </p>
   <p>The <em>Union Record</em> drew coverage of the passage of the act out over the    next month. Though the weekly edition on March 11 notes the passage of a    workmen&rsquo;s compensation bill through legislative committee in Ohio,<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[xxx]</a> there is only brief mention of the passage of the Washington State bill.<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[xxxi]</a>&nbsp;    A March 18th review of labor legislation passed in Olympia    contains an editorial note apologizing for this lack of coverage due to &ldquo;the    pressure of business during the closing days of the Legislature.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[xxxii]</a>&nbsp;    The article provides a basic summary of the act and praises it roundly:    &ldquo;From every standpoint this is undoubtedly the most advanced piece of    legislation ever enacted in our country.&rdquo;&nbsp;    A two-column front-page article in the April 1 edition provides an    extensive summary of the new act written by Peter Henretty of the Governor&rsquo;s    Compensation Commission<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[xxxiii]</a>,    and an editorial voices support for the governor&rsquo;s leadership: </p>
   <blockquote>
     <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
         <p>&ldquo;Governor          M.E. Hay will be remembered by members of organized labor as a man who          stood by his guns . . .&nbsp; Governor Hay gave [the matters of the women&rsquo;s eight-hour          law and workmen&rsquo;s compensation] careful consideration during the          formative period, listened to the arguments for and against after their          passage, and like a man, signed the bills because they would benefit          humanity, thus placing that on a higher standard than the dollar.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[xxxiv]</a> </p>
       </blockquote>
     </blockquote>
   </blockquote>
   <p>By the sounds    of it, the principle organ of organized labor in King County could not have    been happier. </p>
   <p>Limited coverage of news    relating to the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act and broader national and    international concerns around workmen&rsquo;s compensation continued in the <em>Union    Record</em> and <em>The Star</em> in the    following months,<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[xxxv]</a> but there is no subsequent mention of the act in the Seattle dailies until the    implementation of the law on October 1, 1911.&nbsp;    The <em>Times</em> blandly reported    the implementation of the law in a short, page-eight article that focused    primarily on payment exemptions granted by the new State Industrial Insurance    Commission to specific industries such as contractors and lumber mills that    plan to close soon.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[xxxvi]</a> Higher billing was given to two short articles detailing damages that were    being pursued by injured workers in the federal circuit courts.<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[xxxvii]</a> </p>
   <p>The <em>PI</em>, on the other hand, ran an article summarizing the successful    defense of the law through legal challenges before the State Supreme Court and    future anticipated challenges to the law.<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[xxxviii]</a>&nbsp;    The article touted Washington State as &ldquo;the pioneer state in    attempting to solve the problem of compensating injured workingmen and their    dependents without the great cost and numerous delays that are now features of    such actions.&rdquo; An accompanying editorial in the same edition offered the    &ldquo;novel&rdquo; legislation measured praise, stating that it was &ldquo;aimed to meet    and to do away with a large number of evils,&rdquo; including exploitative    insurance companies and &ldquo;ambulance chaser&rdquo; attorneys.<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[xxxix]</a>&nbsp;    The editors concluded: &ldquo;If the law proves a success, there is no    question that it will be taken up in all other progressive states.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>The Star</em> and the <em>Union Record</em> provided no direct coverage of the implementation of the law. </p>
   <p>Press coverage of the development and implementation of Washington State&rsquo;s    1911 Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act varied significantly from newspaper to    newspaper.&nbsp; Particularly among    Seattle newspapers, amount and slant of coverage and editorial opinion seemed    to reflect the fundamental political and economic interests of the newspaper    publishers and their intended audiences.&nbsp;    While scholars have contended that passage of the Washington    Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act resulted from a unique partnership in compromise    between the state&rsquo;s industry and labor intrests, the variable press coverage    of the political struggle that brought it to fruition likely affected and    reflected public sentiment toward the struggle.</p>

Labor History, 1976;      531-550.&nbsp; I will refer      frequently to Tripp&rsquo;s research to provide broader context for more      specific analysis. </p>
