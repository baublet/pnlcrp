   <p>Seattle&rsquo;s labor community saw many developments in the late teens and early  twenties, and one small but important group that played a part in these  developments was the African American population. Organized labor in Seattle was  very active and was seen by many people as even radical, with the Seattle  General Strike of 1919 being given for evidence. In relation to the African  American community though, the labor movement was anything but radical. Seattle  unions were often racist and excluded Blacks from their ranks. At other times  they voiced support for Blacks, but in actuality they did little to erase the  color bar in unions. </p>
   <p>African Americans experiencing these racist attitudes developed an ambiguous  relationship with labor, with some supporting and others opposing labor unions.  Those who did support unions tended to see unions as an opportunity for economic  advancement. Others, who were influenced by local Black leaders, saw unions as a  hindrances and strikebreaking as a means to create an open shop, and more job  opportunities. Still others opposed unions for the basic reason that they had  experienced union exclusionary practices. Also very important to this  relationship was the employer. They often exploited racial tensions, heightening  fears that African Americans would take union jobs and setting African Americans  against unions, ensuring that the two would find it difficult to join in  solidarity. </p>
   <p>The relationship between Blacks and labor has been researched by a number of  authors, and I would like to quickly acknowledge three works. The earliest,  Robert Pitts&rsquo;s Organized Labor and the Negro in Seattle, provides  information on the Black migration to Seattle, and most importantly, detailed  information concerning Black relations with the Longshoremen, and Musicians. Of  equal importance is Quintard Taylor&rsquo;s The Forging of a Black Community.  He provides valuable insight into the economic condition of the African American  community and points out that the tension between labor and the Black community  was due to the attitudes and actions of Labor, Blacks, and Business. This is a  conclusion that after my research I have not been able to refute. The latest  research, Dana Frank&rsquo;s Race Relations and the Seattle Labor Movement,  1915-1929, presents valuable data, and argues that when unions did admit  African Americans, they did so to lessen the chance that independent Black  associations would threaten their bargaining position. These three have been  helpful in guiding my research into the African American experience during this  period. </p>
   <p>At the turn of the century Seattle witnessed the emergence of an African  American community. Just three years previous in 1897, Seattle acted as the  departure point for the Alaska Gold Rush. The gold rush created an economic boom  in Seattle that led to a huge expansion in shipbuilding and a large increase in  trade with Asia. The increase in shipbuilding also helped other small industry  related to it to start. </p>
   <p>These developments brought many people to Seattle looking for new opportunities,  and among these were several thousand African Americans. As a result of  Seattle&rsquo;s booming economy, the African American population grew from 406 in  1900 to 2,206 in 1910 with a total population in Seattle at that time of  237,194. This 465 percent increase was the largest increase that the African  American community would have for several decades, and enabled a small but  vibrant African American community to form. </p>
   <p>The African Americans arriving at this point took jobs in the service industries  with the men working as waiters, cooks, elevator operators and bellboys, and the  women either working as domestics or homemakers. These jobs unfortunately became  known as their "traditional work". The expansion of the Seattle  economy, which went through cycles of boom and bust, was very important for  Black workers who&rsquo;s economic survival depended on a good economy. With the  types of jobs that they held in the service industry, they were susceptible to  any downturns in the economy that would make their jobs expendable if the  economy went bad. The reason for this being that as the higher paid white  industrial workers were laid off, they would have less money to spend on the  local economy. The expansion of the Seattle economy, which went through cycles  of boom and bust, was from 1897 with the beginning of the gold rush to the end  of World War One (WWI) in a boom period. </p>
   <p>As Seattle&rsquo;s economy was expanding with the discovery of gold, increased trade  and shipbuilding, the Seattle labor movement was also expanding and becoming  more powerful. The dominant labor organization was the American Federation of  Labor (AFL), with the Seattle Central Labor Council (SCLC) as its local body.  The Seattle SCLC was made up primarily of craft unions that were composed mainly  of skilled middle class white men. These unions were "craft unions in the  building trades, joined by metal trades workers, skilled printers, and craft  workers from the service sector, such as musicians, barbers, and butchers". </p>
   <p>In competition with the AFL were the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or  Wobblies). They were much smaller than the AFL, and they were more radical,  presenting a much different type of unionism. They encouraged industrial  unionism that would include all, and create as they called it &lsquo;one big  union&rsquo;. As part of this all-inclusive ideology they did not discriminate on  the basis of race or gender. An African American, Fred Woodson, who was involved  with the Wobblies during this early period remembered that "they were  without a question not prejudiced, providing entertainment and food to any that  wanted it every Saturday night". Although small, the IWW continued to  influence the Seattle labor movement and offered an alternative to the  conservative and closed craft unionism of the AFL. </p>
   <p>The start of WWI in 1914 led to further changes in the Seattle economy  and labor market. Although the United States did not enter the war until 1917,  it was a major provider of shipping to the warring parties, and Seattle became  one of the nation&rsquo;s biggest producers of shipping. By 1916 the European war  had disrupted U.S. shipping enough for the federal government to construct an  independent merchant fleet and due to this profitable contracts were sent to the  nations shipyards. In Seattle by war&rsquo;s end the shipyards according to  historian Dana Frank, "employed between 30,000 and 35,000 workers and had  produced one-fourth of all tonnage manufactured for the government during the  war". </p>
   <p>This increase in shipyard jobs and related industries led to an increase  in the number of people coming to Seattle for work. Although there was a boom in  the shipyards and related work though, the number of African Americans coming  was relatively small, with an increase of 688 between 1910 and 1920 out of a  total increase of 78,127 during the same time period. This may have been due to  the fact that the work was not in the service sector and therefore not in their  &lsquo;traditional work&rsquo; areas as had been the case during the previous decade. </p>
   <p>Even  though there was not a large increase in the African American population during  this period, it was in 1916 that the Black community and labor really came into  contact. The International Longshoreman&rsquo;s Association (ILA) in 1916 struck on  the West Coast in response to an announcement by the Waterfront Employers  Association (WEA) that there would be a pay reduction. In response to the strike  by the Longshoremen, the WEA stated their intent to use non-union labor to break  the strike. In order to find worker to replace the strikers, the WEA looked to  the African American community. This was a new phenomenon because in the past  immigrant labor had been used to break strikes, but due to the war in Europe,  the employers had to look for other sources. </p>
   <p>In 1914 James A. Roston Sr. had moved to Seattle after serving in the  military as a lieutenant in the all Black 10th U.S. Calvary. He  became a prominent African American citizen and was involved in various business  ventures. One of those ventures focused on the ILA strike in 1916. Mr. Roston  placed ads in papers around the country looking for African Americans to come  west and replace the striking longshoremen. In co-operation with the WEA, 1,400  non-union workers, of whom 400 were African American, were brought to Seattle. </p>
   <p>This was the first time Blacks had been used to break a strike in Seattle and it  caused much racial conflict and violence. According to Matti Harris an African  American who lived in Interbay, a neighborhood near the docks, there were roving  bands of white strikers going around not far from her house near the docks  harassing Blacks. This type of violence was not uncommon against Blacks near the  waterfront. Horace Cayton, an African American who was working as a strike  breaker recounted this story of strikers entering a street car and confronting a  number of Black strike breakers who at this point are not responding.  "Still the man did not move. With that the striker swung his cargo hook and  caught him just below the ear, pulling him to his feet like a half of beef. The  pinioned man gave a muffled scream&hellip;". </p>
   <p>This  type of treatment by ILA strikers was by no means conducive to eventual  cooperation between whites and Blacks. Yet the violence during the strike was  not one sided. In retaliation for these actions, African American strike  breakers according to Ms. Harris, "went into the Longshoremen Hall&hellip;and  they beat (the strikers) up and&hellip;gave as good as they got". These actions  were not condemned by the employers and only furthered to divide the two sides. </p>
   <p>In order to better protect the interests of the African Americans strike  breakers Mr. Roston set up what was called the Benevolent Protective  Association. This organization was supported by both the Employers Association  and the Chamber of Commerce, and acted as a company union. Its goal was to hire  new workers, and protect current employees. Another aspect of this association  though, was to create better relations between the African American workers and  the ILA. An article in the Searchlight, an African American weekly that  will be discussed in more detail later said, "Its first step was to  organize workers and erase the false impression of the Unions, that the colored  man was their enemy and did not believe in organization&hellip;". </p>
   <p>In October of 1916, meetings were also held at various Black churches like Mt.  Zion Baptist Church to discus the problems on the waterfront. One poster  advertising the event stated, "Can the Negro hold his own as Longshoremen?  Each Afro-American of this city should be interested in the outcome of this  important question, because of what it means to him or her from an economic  standpoint". Mr. Roston&rsquo;s desire for a better relationship between  African Americans and the ILA came to fruition at the end of the strike. </p>
   <p>In 1917 when the United States entered WWI, pressure from the federal government  brought the strike to an end. Due to the weakness of the ILA after the strike,  large IWW support within the ILA for racial inclusiveness, and the relatively  large number of Blacks working as longshoremen, conditions were then conducive  to allowing African Americans to join the union. Mr. Cayton was one of those who  joined the union. He encouraged other Blacks to join, and he said that,  "others followed, so that within a short time we did have a Black and white  union, a closed shop, and a union dispatching office". </p>
   <p>This was a win for the African Americans, and yet they still faced  discrimination. According to Frank Jenkins a long time African American member  of the ILA, "the employer was able to keep the work crew separated in order  to cause division in the ranks. When this occurred, tension did tend to develop  and discrimination made it hard for African Americans to stay in, let alone join  the union. As Cayton states, "we noticed that the dispatchers were  beginning to discriminate against Negro longshoremen on the pretext of union  seniority. When work was slack, (we) were frozen out." In this situation,  the union was unfortunately returning to the status quo and the common practice  of discriminating against people of color. </p>
   <p>In the 1916 strike, African Americans had taken advantage of an opportunity to  move out of their &lsquo;traditional work&rsquo; and move into higher paying jobs. In  doing so they were forced to cross a picket line and displace striking workers,  thereby breaking the strike. After the violence of the strike the union  recognized that it had to absorb the African American workers or they would  continue to be a threat. The WEA manipulated the situation further by playing on  the racial tensions and encouraged discrimination based on race. This along with  continuing racist views in the union led to a decrease in the number of Blacks  working as Longshoremen in Seattle during the time period being examined. </p>
   <p>The beginning of WWI also brought opportunities beyond the waterfront to  African Americans, and gave them the possibility of moving into other  &lsquo;non-traditional work&rsquo; areas. As white service men enlisted in the military,  Blacks were given an opportunity to work in the shipyards and allied industries.  This gave them access to better paying jobs, and on occasion union jobs that  during normal times would be blocked to them. </p>
   <p>During these war years there was disagreement in the African American  community over the importance of labor unions. Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly  was one of those voices that held a strong opinion. This paper was started in  August 1916 by Horace Cayton Sr., a prominent figure in Seattle&rsquo;s African  American community. Previous to this he had published the Seattle Republican  which closed in 1913 and had catered to a white and Black audience. The Cayton  family was well known in both the African American and white communities during  this time period. They had lived in an upper-class neighborhood on Capital Hill  for many years, until they ran into financial trouble and moved to the central  district in 1909. Mr. Cayton was involved in the Republican Party and well  connected with the local state business and political communities were he was  well respected. Because of this, his views tended to be pro business, with a  &lsquo;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&rsquo; mentality. After falling into  financial trouble, he had to find a way to support his large family that ranged  from babies to teenagers. To this end he started Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly. </p>
   <p>This publication, four pages in length, was focused towards Seattle&rsquo;s African  American community. It contained political news from across the country that  would be interesting to a Black audience, as well as editorial observations on  national and local politics. With a maximum circulation of 1,500, and 400  subscribers, it was distributed to a good percentage of the African American  population. The content though reflected the views of the editor, and when it  came to labor issues, he opposed unions as corrupt and backward institutions. An  example of the newspapers harsh treatment of labor was during a streetcar strike  when an editorial said, "&hellip;the strike for official recognition of the  union, which we reiterate is not only tyrannical, but damnable and should  receive no moral support from the great rank and file of this community".  Although Mr. Cayton had fallen on hard financial times, he maintained a loyalty  to business and a dislike for labor, as will be seen again later in relation to  the Seattle General Strike.&nbsp; </p>
   <p>The other major African American publication of the time was The Searchlight,  published and edited by Samuel Debow another prominent African American. Not as  much is known about The Searchlight as Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly, although  we do know it was a weekly, started in 1902 and was published specifically for  the African American community. The Searchlight, as opposed to Cayton&rsquo;s  Weekly, was more of a community paper and did not deal as much with national  political issues. Instead, it dealt more with events occurring in the Black  community in relation to personal and church events. That is not to say though,  that it did not deal with issues of politics or economics. In the cases when it  did so, it was a more pro labor and working class paper than Cayton&rsquo;s  Weekly. In one editorial concerning a strike at the gas works (Gas Works  Park?), with African Americans involved, it stated, "The capitalists are  struggling in the last trench to keep the Negro and the laboring white man from  joining forces for their mutual benefit." From this editorial it is clear  that the paper sees business as what is keeping Blacks and unions apart. </p>
   <p>The Searchlight also advocated in a December 1919 editorial for the  formation of a local chapter of the Railway Association. There were a large  number of African American railway men in Seattle and this was seen as a good  way of getting them organized. Another clear difference between the two papers  is seen in their stance on the 1920 mayoral election. The Searchlight  endorsed James Duncan, head of the SCLC saying, "&hellip;he is a representative  candidate of the working people, he advocates the ideals that are of vital  importance to the laboring masses." Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly on the hand  endorsed Caldwell saying, "From a commercial standpoint, it is to the  cities best interest that Caldwell&hellip;be elected in preference of Duncan." </p>
   <p>The difference between these two papers can be partially attributed to their  different editors, with Mr. Cayton being more business oriented, and Mr. DeBow  favoring the working class and labor unions. Their audience though, would have  for the most part been working class, since the African American population was  small and could only have supported a small middle class, if at all. Therefore  the views within the community regarding organized labor must have differed  greatly based on job experience, education and economic opportunities that were  available to them. </p>
   <p>One example of an individual who was supportive of organized labor was Mr.  Jenkins. As we saw, he was a longtime member and activist in the  Longshoremen&rsquo;s union, and believed strongly in labor. He said that during this  period when he was working on the docks, the hiring done at the union hall on  the waterfront was much more evenhanded than that done by the employers. He went  on to say that, "the discrimination was rampant by the Waterfront Employers  Association&hellip;". He was one of those who had done well in the union and saw  the employer as the enemy of both labor and the African American. </p>
   <p>In 1919, the Seattle General Strike occurred. The strike occurred for  three main reasons; first, out of sympathy for the striking shipyard workers,  second, due to Marxist ideas circulating within the labor movement at the time,  and third, out of a desire to preempt industry and keep union wartime gains. In  the African American community the feelings toward organized labor remained  mixed. In Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly an editorial before the strike stated,  "we can hear the din of the strikers and in our mind&rsquo;s eye we can see  Seattle being torn into shreds and the cold hungry hordes eating grass like so  many cattle". The writer, it is obvious, does not support the strike, and  seems rather concerned about it. Chances are that his audience has similar  feeling about the strike. </p>
   <p>Although Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly came out against the strike we know  that at least some African Americans supported it. Of the 65,000 people that  went on strike, at least 300 were African American men who were members of the  longshoremen&rsquo;s union. This is important because it shows that some part of the  Black community felt enough loyalty to the union cause to go out on strike. Yet,  too many African American workers and other people of color were at this point  still bared from entering unions to make this a truly all-inclusive general  strike. </p>
   <p>Shortly after the failure of the general strike, an article appeared in  Cayton&rsquo;s Weekly again ridiculing the strike. It stated that, "The very  idea of distressing the capitalistic class for not granting the shipyard workers  their demands was ridiculous and absurd from the outset". He went on to say  that he thought the shipyards would remain closed, but when they reopened he  hoped that they would operate as an open shop. Again, this demonstrates the low  opinion that some in the African American community had for labor unions. </p>
   <p>On the other hand, some African Americans like Mr. Jenkins did seem to  support the concept of unions. An example of this is James Roston Sr. who we saw  earlier involved in the 1916 longshoremen&rsquo;s strike. Several weeks after the  Seattle General Strike he along with D.A. Graham, a fellow African American,  sent a letter to the SCLC concerning race relations. They requested that the  color bar for all unions that were affiliated to the SCLC be removed, saying,  "(Blacks) are refused membership in most of the unions of the city simply  on account of race, and consequently are denied the privilege of earning an  honest living". This request was endorsed by the Seattle Union Record,  and agreed upon by the SCLC. </p>
   <p>The SCLC stated, "The unanimous sentiment expressed was that if organized  labor was to have union organization it should take in all the workers".  Unfortunately, the detail of bringing African Americans into the unions  was left to a committee to be appointed later. This committee was never formed  and the exclusionary policies stayed intact. Labor&rsquo;s relationship with African  Americans seemed to follow this pattern. They would voice support or approval,  but equality within the union did not often come. In August 1919, the Seattle  Union Record ran an article saying that, "the Negro was half free and  that politicians and employers used the Negro against the whites." This was  true and it is important that they recognized it, yet the solution they offered  was for Blacks to join unions. Unfortunately, African Americans were for the  most part excluded from joining unions, which makes the solution impossible. </p>
   <p>Several days later, they published a letter from James Roston, asking national  newspaper publishers "to play fair with the Negroes". In other words,  to treat them with the same respect given to whites. By printing this letter,  they were recognizing the need for equality between Blacks and whites, and yet  concrete means for addressing and solving the problem were never implemented. </p>
   <p>Other segments of the labor community were more radical in their outlook towards  African Americans. The Forge, a radical Seattle newspaper stated that,  "If a Negro is good enough to work for an employer he is good enough to  organize with&hellip;" and went on to say, "Together we win is a slogan  which must include the Negro as well as the white worker." This segment of  labor, identifiable mostly in the IWW, may have implemented their beliefs if  they had more power, but this is something we will never know. </p>
   <p>Not all union publications printed articles speaking of the need for equality.  The newsletter for the musicians union often ran racist Black jokes of all  nature, including Ku Klux Klan jokes. African American musicians, it should be  known, were in competition with white musicians, and were interested in  unionization. The derogatory nature of the union may have been one of the  reasons for local African American musicians to feel that they would not be  treated equally in the musicians union. So, feeling alienated from the white  local, they formed their own union in 1917, affiliated with the American  Federation of Musicians. </p>
   <p>However, any small economic or unionization gains that African Americans had  made during the war were lost as WWI came to a close. African Americans were  laid off from their war-related jobs as well as menial and domestic jobs they  had held before 1917. This was due to number of reasons; first, returning  service men taking over industrial jobs, second, employers exploiting race  differences, and third, a general hardening of racial lines. White women took  some &lsquo;traditional jobs&rsquo; of Black men, and Black women faced competition from  Japanese and Filipino men. By 1920, job expansion for African Americans had  stopped. </p>
   <p>In the postwar year, a few unions announced the elimination of the color bar,  such as the Pacific Coast Metal Trades. In 1920 they announced that they had  "abolished the color line". The Longshoremen&rsquo;s union proudly replied  that they had already done so. Unfortunately, at this point they only  had 100 African American members left, out of 15,000 Longshoremen working. The  vast majority of Seattle&rsquo;s unions though, continued to exclude African  Americans. These craft and industrial unions continued to promote the idea of  exclusion, to the detriment of themselves, African Americans and the labor  community as a whole. </p>
   <p>In closing, the relationship between organized labor and the African  American community was very much shaped during and the five years between 1916  and 1920. This period witnessed much change in Seattle, starting with the Ship  Stewards strike in 1916 were African Americans clashed with labor, gaining  higher paying jobs and in the end a union. The start of WWI supplied more jobs  and opportunities to Blacks, and was a time when organized labor was able to  make large gains. For all of these developments though, the opinions within each  community did not really change, and remained divided within each. The majority  of labor remained bigoted, and unwilling to change, with a few minor exceptions  seen in the Longshoremen and other radicals. The African American community  remained divided depending on a number of variables. The employer was also  responsible, playing of racial tensions, and manipulating them to their own  advantage. Leaders in both communities saw and recognized this, and yet they  were not able, at this point, to overcome the divisions. That would have to wait  many decades.</p><br>
