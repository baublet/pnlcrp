 <div class="heading">Oral histories and Strike Memories:<br>
   Rob Rosenthal's 1977 interviews</div>
 <div class="intro">
   <span class="style3">In 1977, Rob Rosenthal interviewed 35 men and women who participated in or remembered  the  1919  General Strike. He recorded the interviews while researching his MA thesis: &quot;After the Deluge: The Seattle General Strike of 1919 and its Aftermath&quot; (UC Santa Barbara, 1980). Now a Professor of Sociology at Wesleyan University, Rosenthal  has generously agreed to share these oral histories with the Seattle General Strike Project.  These audio mp3 files and  transcripts comprise a rare and valuable resource. The narrators speak not only about the events of 1919 but about later aspects of Pacific Northwest labor and political history. </span>
     <br><br>
  <div class="intro"><span class="style3">Dave Beck is the most famous of the men and women interviewed. Later to serve as President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Beck was 24 years old at the time of the General Strike, newly discharged from the Navy and was part of a group of Teamsters who opposed the strike. Beck is only narrator whose  name can be identified. The others use pseudonyms. Rosenthal explains the reasons and the<a href="http://condor.wesleyan.edu/openmedia/rrosenthal/audio/seattle/seattle.html"> interview process here</a>. </span>
    <br><br>
  <div class="intro"><span class="style3">The narrators were elderly at the time of the interview; most had been in their  teens or 20s in 1919. They range across occupations, social classes, and political perspectives; including a number who joined the IWW and the Communist Party. Rosenthal was exploring the political legacies of the strike in his thesis and he asked important questions about how the dramatic events of 1919 lived on in political practice and historical memory. </span></p>

    <p>Dave Beck was a 24 year-old laundry driver in 1919. Just discharged from Navy, he had arrived in Seattle right around time of Strike. 
He opposed the Strike before and after, and advocated laundry drivers oppose it. In the interview he says most 
people thought it was a miserable failure. Many comments on history of labor 
movement, absurdity of general strikes, importance of business unionism. Knew 
many of the important figures in the Strike (Strong, Ault, Duncan).</p>
