   <p align="left">The  construction of race in the United States has been a long process of redefining  and reaffirming the ideas of whiteness and citizenship. &nbsp;This racialized form of thinking was by no means a forgone  conclusion from the creation of our country, but was a thought process that was  created and perpetuated over hundreds of years, continuing through today.&nbsp;  The process of organizing labor was certainly not immune to these habits  of perception.&nbsp; In fact, by studying  union newspapers such as the <em>Seattle Union Record</em>, we can clearly see a  reflection of racial thinking (at times even a propagation of the legacy)  inherent in the ways and actions of unions and their organizers.&nbsp;  In taking on this subject it is important to remember that my intention  is not to paint a picture of racist Seattle unions, or to generalize that they  are in some way bad.&nbsp; What I will do  is show first, how, as much as any group, they were victims of prevailing early  twentieth century thought, and second that organized labor took on this persona  often in contradiction to their preaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">To  accomplish this, I will approach the subject in two parts.&nbsp;  First, in order to establish the historical pattern of racial thought  processes, I will briefly discuss the construction of race and racial thinking  in the United States.&nbsp; The second  portion of this effort will be focused on how that pattern of thought extended  in to and shaped ideas surrounding the organization of labor as it is reflected  in the <em>Seattle Union Record</em> from 1910 to 1918.&nbsp;  This is an important time in labor organization leading up to the Seattle  General Strike, and is a sufficient length of time to prove an ingrained way of  thinking</p>
   <p align="left">It  is important to first understand that race, and the system of racialized  thinking, was not a forgone conclusion, rather, it was something created over  time.&nbsp; Physical difference, while  playing a large role, is not a sufficient explanation to account for what  happened.&nbsp; In the 1620&rsquo;s, a black  man named &ldquo;Antonio a Negro&rdquo; entered Virginia, marrying his wife, &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo;  in 1625.&nbsp; Antonio and Mary were  likely indentured servants in the slave trade, and eventually bought their  freedom.&nbsp; At one point, Antonio  owned land, had livestock, and even had some indentured servants of his own.&nbsp;  This is an important event considering he and his wife were black <em>and </em>free,  and begins to break down the idea that the color barrier always existed.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i</a></p>
   <p align="left">By  the end of the 17th and early 18th century, however,  perceptions began to change quite rapidly.&nbsp;  Regardless of their color, slaves had always been looked down on.&nbsp;  Then, during this time, laws began to be passed that started to define  who was a slave and who was free.&nbsp; Those  laws began to define differences between blacks and whites, often making the  distinction between Christian and black, and eventually equating Christian with  white, and savage with a vague and undefined &ldquo;other.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a>&nbsp;  When America finally declared its independence from England in 1776, the  idea of freedom was largely attached to land ownership.&nbsp;  Due to the fact that the majority of the people in the country did not  own land (and those who did were white), it made for a narrow definition of  &ldquo;free&rdquo;.&nbsp; Following this was the  Antebellum period and the domestic slave trade in America that solidified the  differences between white and &ldquo;other.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">The  Naturalization Act of 1790 is particularly important in institutionalizing  racial thinking.&nbsp; The act stated  that any &ldquo;free white person&rdquo; could be naturalized as a citizen.&nbsp;  The real problem with this was that it never defined what the law would  consider to be &ldquo;White.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whiteness was defined by what it was not, instead of what it  was.&nbsp; The process of enjoying  freedom as a &ldquo;free white person&rdquo; in America therefore became an extremely  subjective one.&nbsp; The ways to decide  who was considered &ldquo;white&rdquo; became a matter of common knowledge and  scientific evidence.&nbsp; The courts  were extremely inconsistent in their judgments, however, often times ignoring  scientific evidence (which was really only a matter of a consensus among  anthropologists, not necessarily what we would consider unequivocal scientific  evidence today) when it conflicted with common knowledge. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[iii]</a>&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">In  the period between the Civil War and the early twentieth century, the  marginalization of people of color continued in many ways.&nbsp;  Black people suffered the worst wrath through periods of lynching and  segregation.&nbsp; These were largely the  White Southerner&rsquo;s backlash to the effects of the Civil War.&nbsp;  The way of life that many wealthy, slave-owning families had enjoyed was  destroyed by the war, and by the loss of their slaves.&nbsp;  The continuing process of defining &ldquo;white&rdquo; and &ldquo;other&rdquo; is also  reflected in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, when white workers were  concerned about their jobs being taken by Chinese immigrants.&nbsp;  One of the best examples of defining racial lines during this period,  however, is seen in the period of American Imperialism in the early 20th  century.&nbsp; During this time, there  was an underlying theme of expanding our markets and civilizing other parts of  the world.&nbsp; This form of politics  was seen strongly in our approach to Cuba, the Philippines, and China, where we  were not only &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; to help steer these people in the right direction,  but it was our duty as the superior race to take on this task.&nbsp;  This idea further solidifies the correlation between &ldquo;American&rdquo; and  &ldquo;White.&rdquo;&nbsp; The period was filled  with the consistent demonetization of other races.&nbsp;  The &ldquo;others&rdquo; were made out to be lesser people who did not show the  fitness for self-government that Anglo Saxons so convincingly displayed.&nbsp;  Teddy Roosevelt expressed significant concern about the ideas of eugenics  and race suicide, that could potentially undermine our country and the way of  life that had been so carefully built. <a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[iv</a></p>
   <p align="left">This  is, admittedly, a very brief history of an extremely complicated process.&nbsp;  The main idea is that racialized thinking took root over roughly a  two-hundred year period as a result of a combination of laws (some specifically  drawing lines and others remaining extremely vague and open to interpretation),  social changes, economic expansion, and labor concerns.&nbsp;  This historical process of creating racialized thinking is very important  in understanding how whiteness is portrayed in the <em>Seattle Union Record</em>.&nbsp; Understanding this history puts the plight of organized labor  into a very different perspective, as I will show.&nbsp; The examples that I have gathered are from the <em>Seattle  Union Record</em>, generally from around Independence Day.&nbsp; This is done purposefully, as a point of irony, because of  labor&rsquo;s fight for freedom and because of&nbsp;  the questions over who exactly, in this country, at that time, were to be  considered both citizens and free to appreciate independence?&nbsp;  I have made a fairly extensive use of quotes directly from articles  because the choice of words is so very important in seeing implied answers to  these questions and understanding the thinking behind what is written</p>
   <p align="left">One  very important recurring idea in organized labor is that of the agitator.&nbsp;  It is an underlying theme meant to relieve fear and encourage people to  stand against something.&nbsp; On June 25th 1910 there was an article discussing  the role of the agitator.&nbsp; After  making references to certain biblical figures (including Jesus Christ) as  agitators, it ends by saying, &ldquo;Thank God, reader, that you live in a land  where the agitator is a possibility.&nbsp; Do  not forget that agitation is an unfailing indication of life.&nbsp;  Where there is no agitation there is death.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are several things occurring in this excerpt, one being  the assumption that we all have the right to this freedom.&nbsp;  History tells us, however, that we have that right only as long as we are  White, or of a background considered to be White as dictated by common  knowledge.&nbsp; The other overriding  idea is the use of Christianity, which I have already discussed historically as  a way to separate classes or races of people, this is simply a continuation of  the past.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">A  week later, the July 10th, 1910 issue ran an article titled &ldquo;The  Progress We Have Made&rdquo; that defined three groups with seemingly incommensurate  ideas and goals.&nbsp; In an address to  the Modern Woodmen of America, who were celebrating Independence Day in  Bellevue, Washington, Judge John E. Humphries discussed three main issues: what  was called &ldquo;the Oriental question,&rdquo; the state of labor, and capitalism.&nbsp;  Obviously, it is significant that there are three separate issues, and  race is one of them.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Oriental question&rdquo; was in reference to admitting and  naturalizing Chinese and Japanese people, and enfranchising them &ldquo;like the  white races of Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea  of race suicide is very strong throughout this article, at one point stating  &ldquo;the Mongolian races would capture the Pacific Coast and the United States  without the firing of a gun or the forming of&nbsp;  a line of battle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;&hellip;it would not be many generations until the  white race on the Pacific Coast and elsewhere in the United States would become  extinct.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, to confirm  labor&rsquo;s stance on this issue, Humphries states, &ldquo;Now is the time to agitate  these questions, and see that no man is placed in the United States Senate or in  the national House of Representatives who favors such monstrous doctrines&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;  These three quotes are good examples of the exclusive and inclusive  nature of labor.&nbsp; They want to  organize the workers, but carefully exclude any unwanted groups.&nbsp;  The last quote also revisits this idea of agitation, calling on unions to  stand together, ask the difficult questions, and make a stand for itself</p>
   <p align="left">The  following week, in the July 9th, 1910 edition, there is a very long  article giving the history of the Chinese expulsion from Seattle almost  twenty-five years earlier.&nbsp; Again,  the word &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; comes up in the article, which seems appropriate since  this historical reference is clearly meant to continue agitation toward the  Chinese and cheap labor.&nbsp; In fact,  this idea of cheap labor was an important reason for expulsion, and is an  obvious and continual threat to organized labor.&nbsp;  The danger of Chinese labor, and one of the articles more blatantly  racist statements, are represented in the following selection, &ldquo;White men were  compelled to compete with Asiatics for a chance to live, and any protest against  working with the yellow man was met with the command to go to the office, and  two more Chinks would take his place.&nbsp; Having been born in this country, and my ancestors having  fought in all the battles for freedom and for this government, the fact of being  forced into competition with the Coolies was rather humiliating.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">Within  one week in either direction of Independence Day in 1910, it is plain to see  that labor strongly supports the European, or White, working class.&nbsp;  It has left little room for those that do not belong to that group.&nbsp;  By the next year, there is a strong sense of a movement toward continued  solidarity, with a focus on Socialism.&nbsp; These  examples continue to build on racial thinking and whiteness, but begin to show  the contradiction that is inherent in labor&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">In  three consecutive weeks, there are articles in the <em>Seattle Union Record</em> discussing Socialism, its benefits, and describing it as labor&rsquo;s ultimate  goal.&nbsp; The first on July 1st  1911 states, &ldquo;When Socialism supplants capitalism, poverty will disappear, and  ignorance and sin will pass into history.&rdquo;&nbsp;  From this we can see the painting of a utopian society.&nbsp;  This article attacks wage-slavery and capitalism for creating a system  that basically allows a worker to earn enough to survive until he is able to,  &ldquo;regenerate his labor power.&rdquo;&nbsp; The term wage-slavery has connotations of the Antebellum  South and was a very powerful and common term used mostly in reference to White  laborers.&nbsp; The following edition,  July 8th , 1911, carried an article entitled &ldquo;Socialism, Hope of  the World.&rdquo;&nbsp; It says, &ldquo;Jesus  promised us the kingdom of God on earth.&nbsp; Surely  were socialism ruling this earth today, would not that indeed be the kingdom of  God, i.e. all good?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again,  here is another Christian reference (with all its implied inclusions as well as  exclusions to the group).&nbsp; Then, on  July 15th 1911 there is an article on the minimum wage that ends by  saying, &ldquo;The workers&rsquo; final goal, the abolishing of the wage system, the  extracting of the workers from the category of merchandise and the building of  an industrial republic is our aim, our purpose, our mission.&rdquo;&nbsp;  These last two quotes help clarify the utopian ideal set forth in the  first one.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">From  these ideas of Socialism, however,&nbsp; we  can begin to draw contradictions.&nbsp; Going  back to the article, &ldquo;Socialism, Hope of the World&rdquo; there is an interesting  definition of the term &ldquo;Socialism.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Socialism,  or the co-operative commonwealth, means union, organization, mutually arranged  activity, equality, love, brotherhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The  utopian ideal here sounds good, but given labor&rsquo;s staunch disapproval of cheap  labor sources and racialized thought processes of the previous year, should we  really assume that equality is part of the goal?&nbsp;  Could it be that the qualifier of &ldquo;whiteness&rdquo; is missing from this  definition?&nbsp; The July 15th,  1911 paper also featured an article by Rev. Charles Stelzle called &ldquo;Getting a  Right Start&rdquo; which had a very strong eugenic appeal.&nbsp;  Stelzle writes, &ldquo;When a boy starts out handicapped by weaknesses and  vices which were inherited, it means a hard pull if he is going to win.&rdquo;&nbsp;  The article deals with the issue of trying to give your children a better  life than you had by &ldquo;giving them a healthy body and a strong character.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Eugenics, along with the concern over race suicide, were popular ideas in  the early twentieth century, as I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Believers in these theories thought character traits (both good and bad)  were genetic and could therefore be passed on (as opposed to being learned  behavior).&nbsp; This idea was most  commonly tied not necessarily to people of color, but to those that were not  considered &ldquo;white,&rdquo; and who were seen as lesser people.&nbsp;  This article is important because, to a degree, it continues the  subjugation of an unnamed group of people in the same newspaper that is  promoting equality and the removal of the worker from the category of  merchandise.&nbsp; It is interesting and  important to note here that &ldquo;labor as merchandise&rdquo; was not a problem when it  was in the form of racialized slavery, but became a problem as the country  rapidly grew and white people became the merchandise.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">The  rhetoric picks up again very strongly in the June 21st 1913 <em>Seattle  Union Record</em> in an article by Charles Perry Taylor, the Secretary of the  Washington State Federation of Labor.&nbsp; This  article discusses literacy tests as a protection to labor by making it a  requirement for immigration to the United States.&nbsp;  Taylor argues that if we can make it a requirement to vote (which  ultimately resulted in the disenfranchisement of a very large number of  African-Americans), we should make it a requirement for immigration as a matter  of defending &ldquo;the quality of American citizenship.&rdquo;&nbsp;  He felt that &ldquo;the most feasible measure is the educational test,  because it will exclude about one-third of those particular classes which are  most a menace to the institutions of the United States - in other words, the  most undesirable class of immigrants.&rdquo;&nbsp; So  what would constitute a desirable class of immigrants?&nbsp;  Taylor offers those from Great Britain, Ireland, Scotland and the  Scandinavian countries, Germany, Holland and France, &ldquo;all of which was of the  same basic stock as that of which the population of America is so largely made  up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;represents one of the strongest and best elements in American  citizenship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Noticeably absent  from that list are any countries from which we might consider the people to be  &ldquo;not white.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">Following  this article on June 28th, 1913 was an editorial article from a  waiter, Ed Levi, in which he claims, in regard to exploitation, that &ldquo;he knows  the meaning of that particular word perhaps better than the rest of humanity.&rdquo;&nbsp;  He finishes by saying the waiters are finally waking up to the fact that  there is strength in numbers and if they organize, they may be able to overcome  this obstacle.&nbsp; Mr. Levi has clearly  overlooked the specter of racialized slavery which would be a much greater  example of exploitation.&nbsp; This  serves as another example of how certain conditions were not necessarily a  problem until they really hit the white working class</p>
   <p align="left">In  1914 immigration restriction came up again in the June 13th edition  in an article outlining an interview with H. H. Wheaton, an assistant labor  commissioner in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Reiterating  the importance of literacy and education as a requisite for admittance to the  United States (as Charles Taylor had done about a year earlier), Wheaton says,  &ldquo;organized labor could depend upon the alien from Europe to support its  principles after proper education.&rdquo;&nbsp; He  also classified the immigration of people from the East as a more serious <em>problem</em> than the immigration from Europe.&nbsp; By  classifying immigrants from the East as a problem, the implication is that the  lesser capable people from the East will most certainly bring down the lifestyle  that has been created.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">This  sentiment is followed up two weeks later on June 27th, 1914 with a  short article on unionizing the Japanese.&nbsp; This  very cautious article posits this possibility in lieu of continuing to fight.&nbsp;  The hope here was that they could be &ldquo;made the allies of the organized  workers rather than permitting them to be used to defeat the ends of the  organized workers.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is  important to point out, however, that the article also states &ldquo;The idea will  not be received with great favor at this time.&rdquo;&nbsp;  We should also consider that this was a very short article placed on the  bottom corner of page four.&nbsp; Certainly  not something one would put on the center of the first page</p>
   <p align="left">With  perfect timing for Independence day, the July 4th 1914 edition ran an  article entitled &ldquo;Oregon Editor is Opposed to Chinese Labor.&rdquo;&nbsp;  This article carefully defines the lines between races and is a strong  continuation of eugenics.&nbsp; There are  two statements that stood out in this article.&nbsp;  The first is, &ldquo;Wherever a white man or woman went to seek labor, they  had to compete with and labor by the side of the Chinese.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Again the idea of cheap labor and competition for work continues to play  a role.&nbsp; Then we read, &ldquo;He also  ought to know that if one race is required to labor with an inferior race in  morals or intellect, that the superior race will suffer and degenerate like the  poor whites of the South did from the competition of African slave labor, the  effect of which is still seen in the descendants of those poor whites of the  Southern states.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stance  here, as well as the reflection of whiteness, could not be more clear</p>
   <p align="left">This  attack continues with an article about the liberation of &ldquo;white slaves&rdquo; from  the cotton mills in the South.&nbsp; At  one point it even says &ldquo;neither tongue nor pen is adequate to describe the  awful wretchedness of their existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Right  next to this article was another one about a resolution put forth by the  American Federation of Labor that would help pass a bill limiting immigration.&nbsp;  The irony here is so great that I will not even venture to comment other  than to repeat that some issues were not even considered issues until they were  &ldquo;whitened</p>
   <p align="left">July  3rd, 1915 brought an article from Seattle where the Butler Hotel  fired all the girls working there, and hired Japanese workers in their place.&nbsp;  &ldquo;This action came as spite work against the recent enactment of a  minimum wage provision for female hotel employees by the Industrial Welfare  Commission in Olympia.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is  yet another example of cheap labor as a threat, and the willingness of  businesses to take advantage of it.&nbsp; Two  weeks later on July 17th, 1915 an article appears which rectifies the  situation entitled &ldquo;Butler Hotel Fires Japs Hires Girls.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Apparently the manager of the Hotel was going to lose his position as  &ldquo;Seattle Booster.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to  the article he would be reinstated &ldquo;without being accused of being a member of  that secret society called &rsquo;The Milky Dows,&rsquo; a Patriotic Order of American  Citizens for the Advancement of Oriental Ideas and the Enrichment of the Sunrise  Kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; He obviously did not  want to be seen as a sympathizer</p>
   <p align="left">Having  thoroughly set the pattern of thought since 1910, my next few examples are from  1917 and 1918, and are from later in the year instead of the weeks surrounding  Independence Day.&nbsp; The purpose for  this is to show that the racial thinking I have proposed did not just occur  around the Fourth of July, but was always prevalent in the <em>Seattle Union  Record</em>, and continued through the nine year period of my research.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">The  September 1st, 1917 Union Record had an article about employers that  ignore race and color.&nbsp; The article  is about the anti-Negro riots that took place in St. Louis and maintains that  &ldquo;our captains of industry systematically pull wires to maintain a surplus of  labor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Black people in this case  represent the threat of cheap labor.&nbsp; In  an attempt to magnify the difficult situation of labor, Harry Kennon wrote,  &ldquo;For white men have been as freely exploited for surplus labor material as  Negroes - more so, since Negro labor is not particularly prized by the northern  captains of industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is a  difficult and inaccurate statement to make, since only fifty years earlier  African Americans were still being forced to work in fields in the South.&nbsp;  To say specifically that white men have been exploited to the same extent  is a stretch by any means.&nbsp; In the  same sentence that Kennon makes the case for abused White labor, he also  denigrates Black labor.&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">Later  that year, in the December 8th, 1917 newspaper, we read an article  about the &ldquo;Dangers of Suppression.&rdquo;&nbsp; This  goes back to the idea of agitation I presented near the beginning of this paper,  and the following excerpt is an example of the aim of organized labor as well as  whiteness.&nbsp; &ldquo;When officialdom,  whether state or national, rushes imperiously into suppressions of individual  liberties, it exposes itself to reasonable suspicions of over-eagerness to seize  opportunities for exercising despotic power and thereby creates democratic  undercurrents of distrust.&rdquo;&nbsp; The  suppression here is in reference to the government limiting certain freedoms  during times of war.&nbsp; The question,  however, is who exactly is it that enjoys these freedoms to their fullest when  we are not at war?&nbsp; The examples I  have given from the past articles would mean that they are generally enjoyed by  white people</p>
   <p align="left">Samuel  Gompers addresses freedom a year later on August 31st 1918.&nbsp;  He says, &ldquo;Win the War for Freedom!&rdquo;&nbsp;  &ldquo;The working people of America are conscious of their vital part in  making victory possible and they will do their part, not as a task, but as a  right - a right to share in the work for securing forever that freedom which  they prize above all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Going back to the previous paragraph, as an example of  whiteness, I ask who really enjoys that freedom</p>
   <p align="left">To  close out 1918, there are two examples of continued racial thinking that tie  into examples I first presented from 1910.&nbsp;  Combined, they show that there has been virtually no change in the  approach to human difference in this nine year period.&nbsp;  The first is from November 18th and is titled &ldquo;Coolie Labor  Not Wanted in This Country.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a  Pacific Coast District Metal Trades Council meeting, they went on record &ldquo;as  strongly opposed to letting down the bars to coolie labor.&rdquo;&nbsp;  As was the case in 1910, and even in the 1880&rsquo;s, Chinese labor remained  a threat to organized labor, and as a result, the Chinese people continued to be  &ldquo;outsiders.&rdquo;&nbsp; The final example  is from two days later on November 20th.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Seventy-five per cent of Seattle&rsquo;s hotels and rooming houses are  controlled by Japanese, is the startling statement made by officers of the Hotel  Maids Local No. 528 after summing up reports made by members.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Even more startling than the fact that the Japanese had that much control  over Seattle&rsquo;s hotels, is the fact that it is considered &ldquo;startling.&rdquo;&nbsp;  The wording is very important because it seems subtle, but carries all  the racist connotations, eugenic fears, and genuine concerns of labor that I  have been talking about throughout this effort</p>
   <p align="left">The  many examples I have given may, to some degree, seem painfully repetitive, which  is the point.&nbsp; The habits of  perception that were formed hundreds of years ago continued to change, but  continued with great strength nonetheless.&nbsp;  They shaped the approach of labor, as well as its contradictory stance on  equality and humanity.&nbsp; From 1910 to  1918, sentiments toward those who were not white remained more or less static,  allowing organized labor to create a group to work against (in addition working  against capitalism) to help solidify their ideals.&nbsp; As I said before, I do not want to condemn labor for this,  but to show that it was simply a victim of a mode of thought that had been in  place since the beginning of our country.&nbsp; It  used race to reinforce its control and position, much like businesses used  hiring practices to find cheap labor to advance their standing.&nbsp;  Both sides are guilty of exploitation in some way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">This  history is extremely important to understand because of the  light it sheds on the current state of thinking. The habits of  perception from the past must be understood in order to change the  perceptions of the present and  the future. If we take a closer look at the structure of unions today,  we see that an impressive change has taken place. No longer are unions  the overt  breeding grounds for racialized thinking that we have seen in this  paper.&nbsp; However, we must understand that the process for altogether  eliminating this  thinking is ongoing. While many immigrant and minority groups are  clearly represented in unions today, they are noticeably few in union  management. This is  arguably a continuation of racialized thinking of the past. The  contradictions we   once lived with and thought processes that I have outlined from the  early twentieth century must not continue if organized labor is to  survive into the  early twenty-first century. Unions are just as much victims of  prevailing thought as they are responsible for redefining and  reaffirming new ways of thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <p align="left">As  a final thought provoking idea (and somewhat of a bonus selection), I am  reproducing a poem entitled &ldquo;What is Slavery&rdquo; in its entirety.&nbsp;  The poem is written by Percy Bysse Shelley, and appeared in the <em>Seattle  Union Record</em> on September 1, 1917.&nbsp; This  piece sums up many of the ideas I have presented, including agitation, slavery,  whiteness, and the plight of labor in  general.&nbsp; In the context of this  paper it should seem more ironic, perhaps even a little appalling, than if read  otherwise.</p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p><strong><u>What is Slavery</u></strong></p>
   <p>&lsquo;Tis to work and have such pay</p>
   <p>As just keeps life  from day to day</p>
   <p>In your limbs, as  in a cell,</p>
   <p>For the tyrant&rsquo;s  use to dwell.&nbsp;</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>&lsquo;Tis to be a slave in soul</p>
   <p>And to hold no  strong control</p>
   <p>Over your own will,  but be</p>
   <p>All of others make  of ye.</p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p>So that we for them are made,</p>
   <p>Loom and plow and  sword and spade,</p>
   <p>With or without  your own will, bent</p>
   <p>To their defense  and nourishment.</p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p>&lsquo;Tis to see your children weak</p>
   <p>With their  mother&rsquo;s pine and peak,</p>
   <p>When the winter&rsquo;s  winds are bleak -</p>
   <p>They are dying  whilst I speak.</p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p>&lsquo;Tis to hunger for such diet</p>
   <p>As the rich man in  the riot,</p>
   <p>Casts to the fat  dogs that lie</p>
   <p>Surfeiting beneath  his eye.</p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p>And at length, when you complain,</p>
   <p>With a murmur weak  and vain,</p>
   <p>&lsquo;Tis to see the  tyrant crew</p>
   <p>Ride over your  wives and you.</p>
   <p>&nbsp; </p>
   <p>Men of labor, heirs of glory,</p>
   <p>Heroes of unwritten  story,</p>
   <p>Nurslings of one  mighty mother,</p>
   <p>Hopes of her and  one another,</p>
   <p>Rise like lions  after slumber</p>
   <p>In unvanquishable  number;</p>
   <p>Shake your chains  to earth like dew</p>
   <p>Which, in sleep,  has fallen on you!</p>
   <p>Ye are many, they  are few.</p>
