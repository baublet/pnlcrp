   <p>Women have always participated in the labor movement of the Pacific Northwest,  the type and extent of their participation was the key question asked about  women&rsquo;s involvement in the labor movement. Although women have played many  roles in the movement the most long-standing and persistent role that women had  was that of supporter of their union husbands. One way that women demonstrated  this role was through their involvement in the Seattle Card and Label League,  while many have not acknowledged their importance to the movement, Kathryn  Oberdeck and Dana Frank have successfully argued that the importance of the  supportive role of women, and the AFL&rsquo;s inability to use them in the movement  was what led to the eventual failure of the movement. But with their entrance  into the once prohibited male work place because of the need for men on the  frontlines of World War I, the role of women in the labor movement evolved to  one where they were given the opportunity to participate more. There were many  reasons for the change in the role of women but the most significant was that  many women workers learned how organization could increase their chances of  successfully negotiating with employers for fairer wages and better working  conditions. </p>
   <p>Armed with the knowledge that their increased participation in the movement  could improve their working conditions, many working women soon came to see the  necessity for more active roles in the movement. Although more participatory  roles were desired by some women workers, the male leaders of the unions and the  American Federation of Labor, which was the key governing body of all the unions  in the nation, did not accept women in these increased participatory roles. But,  despite the male resistance to women becoming more involved in the movement,  women&rsquo;s struggle for more involvement eventually succeeded. This can be seen  in several ways in the Pacific Northwest, the development of the subjects  written for women in the women&rsquo;s section of the Seattle Union Record, as well  as the support that Seattle&rsquo;s women barbers got in forming their own local  union, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Worker&rsquo;s recognition  and support for the telephone operators were all examples of women&rsquo;s increased  involvement in the labor movement. In addition to these developments in  women&rsquo;s roles in the movement, the importance of the Seattle Card and Labor  League and its&rsquo; ability to persuade women to buy union labeled goods  illustrated the necessity of the women&rsquo;s supporting roles to the movement. </p>
   <p>The entrance of women in to the workforce during World War I posed a challenge  to the labor movement. Because of the void left by soldiers women were asked to  enter into once exclusively male occupations such as taxi drivers, machinists,  and ship yard workers. Although women were praised for "responding nobly in  taking the places of men forced to leave their positions to do work essential to  the industries" as well as "for applying for work merely as a  patriotic duty", they were still not permitted to join the unions of their  new occupations. Since union scale was only paid to union members, women in  these positions were paid less than men for the same jobs. Because women were  affected financially by their inability of to join unions, they learned early on  the importance of organization. </p>
   <p>It was this frustration at being paid less than men were for the same jobs,  which led many women workers to want to organize. Women began to learn  "that it is only when they do get together in organizations, and bargain  collectively" that they would be "entitled to the same industrial  opportunities" as men. Thus, they started believing that the only way that  they could improve working conditions and get better wages was by coming  together in unions the way men did. While this idea would seem to be popular and  supported by all working women, there were some who "were not interested in  the working class problems" of their fellow women workers. The lack of  support for the right of women to organize by other women hampered the already  difficult fight women workers faced in trying to organize. While there are  several reasons why many worker women did not choose to support this fight, the  most often cited reason for women&rsquo;s the lack of support was that women workers  saw themselves as temporary workers. Thus by viewing themselves as temporarily  in the workforce, the need to change conditions seemed less important since they  would not be in the workforce for long. </p>
   <p>In addition to being paid less than men, the lack of attention given to their  problems as working women was another reason that women believed in the  necessity of more participatory roles in the labor. Once reason that many worker  women advocated the increased participation of women in the movement was because  a majority of the cases that came before the National War Labor Board involved  "large numbers of women workers". It was because of this that the  Women&rsquo;s Trade Union League believed that it was "both a matter of justice  and of necessity" to have "a women&rsquo;s viewpoint represented in the  membership of the war labor board". The need to have female representation  on the board was necessary since women&rsquo;s cases made up a large majority of the  cases that the board ruled on. Thus, by having female representation on this  labor bureau, women&rsquo;s point of view were heard and discussed by the board,  which would eventually result in better working conditions and wages for women. </p>
   <p>In addition to bothering women, men were also frustrated by the inequality  between the wages women and men were paid for the same work. Since women were  paid less than union scale, males in the workplace saw them as a threat because  they would work for less money than union workers would. This would give them an  advantage over men in the work place when it came to getting jobs as well as  keeping jobs during hard times in the economy. It was this frustration over  women&rsquo;s advantages in the workplace that led many men to support their fight  to organize. Many men believed that the exclusion of women from unions made  women threats the union scale since they were willing to be paid less than men  were for the same jobs. While most men believed non-organized women workers were  a threat to the union scale, most did not publicly acknowledge this. Yet there  were a few who were willing to publicly go on the record about this issue. One  example was from 1918&rsquo;s May 30th issue of the Seattle Union Record,  where one man stated that "union men realize that it is the underpaid women  who really takes away their job, breaks down the conditions, they work  for". The Ruth Ridgway column of the Seattle Union Record was another arena  where men discussed how they felt about the issues concerning working women. One  example comes from the May 31, 1918 column, where a male union worker advised  women workers that "when you take a job, be sure it&rsquo;s fair and demand a  man&rsquo;s wages for a man&rsquo;s work". Many men may have had unselfish reasons  for supporting women worker&rsquo;s in their fight to organize. They viewed  unorganized women as a threat to their livelihood since they were losing jobs to  them. It was the perceived threat that unorganized women posed to them that led  many men to support women workers. </p>
   <p>While many union men supported the right of women to organize, the vast majority  of men did not. There were several reasons for this; the first was that they  believed that the income those women earned at these jobs were not necessary to  theirs and their family&rsquo;s survival, but were instead used for luxuries in  their everyday life. Since it was believed "that women were only working  for pin money" and did not need to work to survive, the importance of equal  wages and safe working conditions for women workers were not seen as important.  Based on this belief that women were not working for the livelihood of their  family, the belief that women could leave their jobs at anytime also hampered  them from getting support from men. Thus, by perceiving that their working was a  only done for extra cash and not for survival, men&rsquo;s beliefs on the importance  of the needs of women workers were decreased. Since men did not believe in the  importance of women earning equal pay as men, the also did not believe that it  was important for women to join unions, which was the only way possible for  women to get equal pay. Thus by putting little importance on the need of women  to earn equal wages, the belief in their need to organize was implicitly  displayed. </p>
   <p>While the belief that women only worked for spare cash was one reason why many  men did not support women in their fight to organize, many also believed that  the majority of women workers, who were young and unmarried were not worth  organizing because they believed that these women viewed themselves as temporary  workers. The belief that women were only working until they found husbands went  along with labor leader&rsquo;s beliefs in the temporary nature of the single woman  worker. Men publicly argued in favor of this belief in newspapers. One example  of the discussion men had about single women workers came from the Ruth Ridgway  column, where one reader wrote that "women are harder to organize than men,  because they are not interested in job conditions, but in getting away from the  job and marrying". Because of the perception that women workers were only  temporary to the workforce, men&rsquo;s beliefs in the importance of equal wages as  well as better working conditions for women decreased. </p>
   <p>The involvement of women in the labor movement has not always been promoted or  accepted, but despite the lack of support that women got in their fight to have  more participatory roles, they did eventually gain a more influential and  powerful role in labor. The evolution of the women&rsquo;s section of the Seattle  Union Record, the locally owned labor paper was a good illustration of the  evolving role of women in the movement. Since the paper was owned by the unions,  the development of the women&rsquo;s section along with the articles written for  women makes this paper more insightful, because it gives you a reliable portrait  of how the leaders in the movement viewed women and their role in the movement.  The magazine section of the paper, which was known as the unofficial women&rsquo;s  section of the Seattle Union Record, was first created in 1909. While one would  expect for this section to appeal to the woman worker since it was labor owned  and ran, it did not ever fully appeal to this audience. This can be explained by  what the leaders believed the role of the women worker should have been. At the  time of its&rsquo; creation women were expected to be supporters of their union men,  not personally involved in the movement. But with time and the development of  the women worker and her increase role in the movement, the paper evolved to  appeal to her concerns while still appealing to the earlier audience of the  union housewife. </p>
   <p>From the Magazine section&rsquo;s conception it had been directed towards the wives  of union men. Because of this cooking, fashion, and household tips were  perceived to be the central issues discussed in this section. The emphasis on  these topics was displayed throughout the columns that were published in this  section. The most explicit example of the newspaper appealing to the housewife  was with the "Our War Garden" column. This column had many tips on how  to can and preserve produce grown in ones&rsquo; garden to how to start ones&rsquo; own  garden. The subjects written about in this column came from letters sent in by  readers. Although one may reason that the newspaper did not direct this column  at housewives, that it was the women who wrote in to this column asking for  advice, that in reality were directing this column, this would be an incorrect  explanation. Instead the title of "Our War Garden" clearly displayed  what type of audience that the newspaper was appealing to with this column. That  being the homemaker that had the time to make the most out of their garden in  the wartime where household products as well as produce were scarce. Thus by  giving advice to women on how to make the most of their gardens, this column was  also advising them how to become better homemakers through the use of their  gardens. </p>
   <p>In addition to the gardening column of the Magazine section, the fashion tip  column also was directed towards the housewives of union men. The fashion tip  column consisted of a photograph and a small description about the fashion trend  of the time. The fashion tips given in this section were rather varied. They  advised women about what types of fabrics were the most fashionable to make  their clothing out of to what angle hats were to be worn to be in fashion. The  "My Husband and I" column written by Jane Phelps was another example  of how the newspaper in its&rsquo; Magazine section appealed to housewives and their  problems. The key topic of this column was the ideal relationship between a  husband and wife. The column began describing a problem that the wife had about  something the husband had said or done to her, but instead of getting angry at  the husband the wife would resolve the problem by changing the ways she viewed  what had happened and the importance that she had given to the incidence. An  example of the meek manner that this column advocated for women comes from  1919&rsquo;s August 6th issue of the Record where Susan Randall, the main  character of the column describes how her mother in law disrespected her by  ordering her around her own home. But instead of expressing her anger to her  husband Tom about her mother in-law "coming into her home and  ordering&hellip;her around" and demanding that Susan call her mother, Susan  decided to keep it to her self and to give in to her mother in-law "for  Tom&rsquo;s sake". This example from the column displayed how the author used  the universal issue of the mother in-law to appeal to housewives. In addition to  using the sore topic of mother in-laws, the name of the column also was used to  appeal to housewives. By creating something in common between the reader and  subject of the column, the author blatantly displayed whom she was hoping to  attract with the column. </p>
   <p>The magazine section of the paper also included articles and poems written by  women. The most famous of female author to write for this section was Anna  Louise Strong the famous reporter, who was known for her unflagging support of  the labor movement, and later on of communism. Quite unusually Strong, who was  the most famous of all women writers for the Seattle Union Record, only wrote  about women&rsquo;s issues under her pen names of "Anise" and the lesser  known one of "Ruth Ridgway", which was researched and written about by  Rebecca Jackson. The reason for this has never been fully explained, but one can  reason that she did not want to lose her credibility with her male colleagues by  writing about women&rsquo;s&rsquo; issues. For someone who did not publicly acknowledge  the importance of women&rsquo;s issues except under disguise, the strong support  Strong had for women in the labor movement was quite surprising. </p>
   <p>Strong used two types of media; her poems and the Ruth Ridgway column to display  her support for working women. Strong wrote poems about the problems that  working women experienced under her pen name of "Anise". Strong&rsquo;s  poem "What Women Shall Wear" was a good example of the issues that she  discussed in her poem column. In this poems she explained how women working in  furniture factories decided to start wearing the male attire of overalls to work  "because it was dangerous for them to wear loose clothing near  machinery" in addition to being against the law. But instead of supporting  the women for being brave enough to wear men&rsquo;s clothing, the other women of  the town "protested that overalls were immodest". This poem displayed  many of the issues that working women were faced with, their need to adjust  themselves in order to work in the new work place, and also the criticisms they  faced by other non-working women. By writing about the difficulty that many  working women faced in the workplace as well as by others who were not involved  in the workplace, Strong helped increase the support that working women got by  making their plights public. </p>
   <p>In addition to using her poems to gain sympathy for women workers, Strong used  her Ruth Ridgway column to gain support for women workers. She did this by  printing letters or her responses to letters that defended women workers. An  example of this was from the 1918&rsquo;s May 18th column where one  reader responded to the allegations that women were taking jobs away from  married men who needed those jobs to support their families. The reader pointed  out in her response to these false accusation that "single men compete with  married men" and for the most part these men "have no one to look  after except themselves" while women who work are generally married and had  "one or more than one dependent upon them". By printing this response  that defended women and their right to work, Strong was displaying her support  for them. While the bulk of Anna Louise Strong&rsquo;s writings were about societal  issues, the support she gave women in the labor movement through her work done  in her pen names were important to gaining support working women. </p>
   <p>But with the growing participation of women in the labor movement, the scope of  this section began to change. While it kept many of its&rsquo; original columns  about gardening, fashion, cooking and the relationships between husbands and  wives to keep appeal to its&rsquo; original audience, which was mainly housewives,  it also added new columns in order to appeal to a new audience, the working  woman. One of these new columns in the Magazine section of the paper was the  "Club Notes" column, which began in early 1920. This column was a  daily journal of what happened at the local women&rsquo;s meetings. It reported on  who held which positions in the clubs as well as what issues were discussed at  the meetings. By writing about women and their the Seattle Union Record appealed  to a different type of reader, by displaying its&rsquo; interest in non-housewife  women&rsquo;s issues. By drawing attention towards the women&rsquo;s unions and clubs  that were in their creation made to fight labor causes, the union was trying to  diversify their audience to encompass labor women as well as housewives as well  as attract the women worker for their readership. </p>
   <p>The Seattle Union Record also created the "For The Worker Women"  section to appeal to worker women. The articles written in this section of the  paper were usually more directly related to the working woman than any of the  other articles written for women. It usually consisted of articles related to  the involvement of women in the labor movement in Seattle as well as the rest of  the world. The topics of the articles ranged drastically. Some articles were  filled with discussions about how much involvement women should have in the  movement, while others introduced and applauded famous women for their  contributions to the cause. While the "For the Worker Women" section  of the newspaper was a huge development in the evolution of the paper treatment  of worker women and their concerns, it was not a total change in how the editors  viewed women. This was illustrated through the placement of articles on fashion,  beauty, and how to be a better homemaker printed on the same pages of the  "For the Worker Women" section. The placement of these contradictory  portrayals of women along side each other on the same page of the paper  displayed the Seattle Union Record&rsquo;s weak support for the working women. By  printing these articles in such close proximity to each other, the Record was  implicitly illustrating its&rsquo; belief that the role of the worker woman was not  independent, but was instead dependent upon her role as a homemaker. </p>
   <p>While the evolution of the Seattle Union Record&rsquo;s attention to working women  and their concerns were easily observable, the reasons for why its&rsquo; focus  evolved was more difficult to explain. One rationalization could be that the  newspaper modified its&rsquo; focus from the housewife to the working women and the  housewife in order to gain a larger total audience for their paper. It was good  business sense for the Record to appeal to many types of readers instead of  conforming it to one specific audience. That was why the "For the Worker  Women" section was such a success for the paper, it gave them a whole new  outlet to write about working women&rsquo;s issues so that they could gain this  reading audience. Thus, by following the progress of women workers as well as  their roles in the movement, and then modifying the newspaper based on how  women&rsquo;s roles changed, the Seattle Union Record illustrated the development of  women in the labor movement. </p>
   <p>The development of the role of women in the Seattle labor movement can also be  illustrated through the observation of the Seattle women barber&rsquo;s union local  number 1. The successful battle that these women fought in order to gain the  right to organize displayed the increased participatory role of women in the  labor movement. Although there were several reasons why the women barbers needed  to organize, the chief reason for organization was financial. Because union  members were advocated to only do business with shops that displayed the union  card, female barbers lost business because they were "unable to display the  union card". Since union cards were only available to members of the  Journeymen Barber&rsquo;s International, which was the national union that barbers  belonged to, the women owned barber shops were unable to gain these union cards,  thus impairing them from doing business with union workers. </p>
   <p>Instead of losing business because of their sex, women barbers decided to try to  get the international to let them join the union in order to stay in business.  While they tried various means of gaining membership in the international, none  worked. But despite the failure of their attempts to become a part of the  international, they did not give up. They instead enlisted the support of their  male counterparts, to show the international the legitimacy and support they had  for their cause. While one may expect that the women barbers had little support  from the male barbers, one could not be more wrong. The male barbers were their  biggest supporters, they publicly stated in the Seattle Union Record that  "they are in no way opposing the unionization of women". Some barbers  even went so far as to "declare that they will patronize the women  regardless of whether they are denied the use of the union shop card by the  international". Even further than just publicly supporting the women  barbers, some male barbers went against the international and helped women  barbers organize a separate local. In addition to gaining and using the support  of their male counterparts effectively, the women barbers were also able to earn  the support and the endorsement of their union from the Central Labor Council of  Seattle, which was the key governing body to all unions in the Seattle. The  Central Labor Council decided to recognize their unions as long as they agreed  to "maintain the same wages, hours, and conditions as those of men barbers,  women barbers are to be granted full recognition and shop cards will be issued  to them". This decision by the Central Labor Council went directly against  the International&rsquo;s decision to refuse a charter to the women barbers. By  gaining the support of the council and the male barbers for their cause and by  causing them to go against the international, the women barbers illustrated  their increased role in labor. </p>
   <p>The female telephone workers were another group that displayed the changes in  women&rsquo;s involvement in labor. While the difficulties they faced in order to  organize were similar to the women barber&rsquo;s problems, they also faced new  problems that the women barbers didn&rsquo;t. The belief that these women viewed  their jobs as temporary hindered them from organizing. Since it was believed  that these women would leave the workforce as soon as they married, the need for  good wages and safe working conditions were not seen as important for these  women. Even some of the individuals interested in helping telephone operators  organize believed this. An example of this came from the 1918 September issue of  the Seattle union Record, where a leader for the telephone operators stated that  due "to the constantly shifting personnel of the company&rsquo;s operators, the  problem of organizing them&hellip;is a hard one". While fighting off their  critics about the nature of their employees was more than difficult enough, the  added criticism from their leaders did not help the operators fight for  organization, but instead hindered it. In addition to battling negative  stereotypes of about their workforce, the operators also had to fight the  telephone companies in order to be able to organize. Many new "girls were  secretly influenced to stay out of the union" and given preferential  treatment if they complied with the wishes of the company. The telephone  companies were so adamantly against the operators organizing that they were  known to "used every trick known to the telephone business to make it  uncomfortable for union operators to remain at work" in order to keep  others from following their lead and joining the union. But despite all of these  challenges they faced in organizing, they joined the Electrical Worker&rsquo;s Union  local 42-A and were recognized by the International Brotherhood of Electrical  Workers, the union&rsquo;s governing body in the summer of 1915. </p>
   <p>Although union recognition was important to the telephone operators, it was the  support that they got from the union brothers that was the most significant to  them. The support that the men of the union gave the operators was quite  impressive, instead of discreetly helping the women in their fight to get better  working conditions and wages, the male union members publicly demanded the that  the operators be treated more fairly. This was seen when a male union member  "called on organized labor&hellip;to assist the Brotherhood of the Electrical  Workers&hellip;in molding public opinion against the conditions complained"  about by the telephone operators. By asking the public to help him and other  male union members to help the operators, the support given to these women by  their union was displayed. In addition to publicly supporting the women, the  union also let them hold positions in the union, which at the time was quite  unheard of. Although women had regularly held offices in women&rsquo;s unions, the  election Margaret Whitten for the financial secretary position was the first  case of a woman holding office in a "regular man&rsquo;s union". The  union&rsquo;s public support of the telephone operators as well as a woman&rsquo;s  successful bid at a position for the union both displayed the increased  involvement that women had in the labor. </p>
   <p>While the roles that women were asked to play in the movement did change  significantly, the role of supporter to the union man did not change. Even when  women began to gain an increased participatory role in the labor movement, they  were still asked to support their union men. This was seen numerous times  throughout the early twentieth century, yet the most common time during this  period when this was advocated was during times of great stress to the movement.  The Seattle General Strike of 1919 was a classic example of this. While many  female unions such as the telephone operators union and the garment worker&rsquo;s  union voted in favor of striking to support the shipyard workers, the absence of  any mention of these unions in the articles describing who participated in the  strike displays the belief in the insignificance of these unions&rsquo;  participation in the strike. Instead importance was given to the need for women  to support their striking union men. Women were not asked to protest in the  actual strike, but were instead told to stay in "their proper role as wife  and mother in the home". They were also asked by labor leaders to  "stand by your man in this, his hour of trial". While it was a  generally men who advocated the supportive role of women in the strike and in  the movement, there were some instances when women advised other women to play a  supportive role in the strike. A poignant example of this was from a wife who  wrote to the Seattle Union Record and advised women to "above all things,  stand by your man, approve him openly. He&rsquo;s working for you and he needs every  ounce of encouragement you can give him in the struggle". This article also  asked women to put up a brave front for her striking man since "nothing  disheartens a man more than a despondent rag of a woman, and nothing heartens  one more than a brave, reliant, resourceful one. The presence of women that  promoted other women to hold supportive roles during a time of crisis, such as  that of the Seattle General Strike displayed that men were not the only ones to  advocate the supportive role women in labor. By asking women to stand by their  man labor leaders as well as many women displayed the importance they put upon  the role of the supportive woman. The absence of any mention about women  personally taking part in the General Strike implicitly illustrated the  disapproval and insignificance labor leaders had for women who participated in  the strike. </p>
   <p>The Seattle Women&rsquo;s Card and Label League was another example of the  supportive role that women played in the movement. From its&rsquo; creation the Card  and Label League was meant to model the supportive role of women in the labor  movement, chiefly because who its&rsquo; members were and its&rsquo; intended purpose.  The organization consisted of the wives of local labor leaders. The goal of the  organization was to persuade women to buy union crafted merchandise. The Card  and Label League carried out its&rsquo; goal by hosting parties where they persuaded  women to buy union made products. While the teas and parties the league hosted  were often criticized as nothing more than a means for them to socialize, the  league was successful in increasing women&rsquo;s support of the movement. Since the  league persuaded women to participate in the movement by buying union made  products and not by actually protesting, the league was performing supportive  function to the movement and its&rsquo; leaders. Because of this many commented on  how the league was more beneficial to the movement than it was the woman&rsquo;s  movement". Although this organization was successful in its&rsquo; attempts to  get women to buy union made products, it hampered the women becoming involved  first hand in the movement by serving the movement in a supportive fashion. </p>
   <p>While the purchase of union goods may seem a small contribution to the labor  movement, it was in reality very important to the labor movement. Many felt that  this was the most significant contribution that women could make to the  movement. Since women were the principal shoppers for their families, the  successful persuasion of them to buy union made goods was extremely important  for the success of the labor movement. If labor was successful in persuading  women to buy only union made goods, it could use the importance of their  purchasing power to negotiate with big business in order to get better wages and  conditions for workers. Many leaders in the AFL stressed to women that  purchasing union made goods was the only way they should help out the movement,  which further displays the supportive role that labor leaders promoted for  women. Leaders in the movement advised men to "induce the home women to  spend the wages of their men in the support of union labels" since it was  the "most important addition to the strength of labor&rsquo;s cause".  While still reinforcing the supportive role of women in the labor movement,  leaders explicitly pointed out their importance to the fate of the movement. The  importance of convincing women to buy union goods was further illustrated when a  Women&rsquo;s Trade and Union League was created by the SCLC to emphasize the  importance of only purchasing union goods, and establishing businesses with shop  cards. Thus, by creating a new organization for the purpose of increasing the  sale of union goods, the leaders of the labor movement displayed the importance  of buying union goods for the success of the movement. The importance put upon  buying union goods also displayed the significance of women and their supportive  roles in the movement. </p>
   <p>While women in the Pacific Northwest did achieve more participatory roles in the  labor movement, the importance of their supportive role in the labor movement  did not diminish. It instead withstood, and remained a powerful and highly  necessary role for women to play in the labor movement. The importance put on  their purchasing union labeled goods displayed the necessity of this role to the  movement. Although some women did remain in supportive roles, this was not true  of all women. Many forged more participatory roles for themselves in the  movement when necessary. This was especially true of the women barbers of  Seattle and the telephone operators. The women barber&rsquo;s successful use of the  support that they received from Seattle&rsquo;s male barbers as well as from the  Seattle Central Labor Council to form their own union, despite the opposition  they got from the Journeymen Barber&rsquo;s International in their request to  organize. To encompass these new types of union women into their readership, the  labor owned Seattle Union Record started to create sections for these women,  while still keeping its&rsquo; earlier magazine section for women who chose to hold  a more supportive role to the movement. Thus, by keeping the women&rsquo;s section  as well as creating "For the Worker Woman" section, the record was  appealing to the two dominant types of roles that women played in the labor  movement of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
