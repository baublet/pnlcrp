 <div class="heading">  Seattle Newspapers Report on Shipyard Workers in 1918 </div>
  <div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The chain reaction that led to the Seattle General Strike began in the shipyards and on the waterfront of Seattle, with shipyard workers fighting for increased wages as they built the ships upon which America&rsquo;s war effort relied. All through 1918 tensions mounted in the shipyards as 30,000 workers contested a federal wage freeze and struggled to find housing in the war-swollen city. Those issues are detailed in<a href="shipyards_webb.shtml"> &quot;Shipyard Workers on the Eve of the General Strike&quot;</a> by Patterson Webb. Here is a remarkable database of 142 articles about the shipyard workers from two Seattle newspapers, the <em><strong>Union Record</strong></em>, published by the Seattle Central Labor Council, and the <em><strong>Seattle Times</strong></em>, the city's most conservative daily. Click the links to read the full article. This database was digitized and compiled by<strong> Patterson Webb</strong>. </p>
