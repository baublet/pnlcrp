</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>By Trevor Williams</P><IMG SRC="olehanson-large.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=279 HEIGHT=424>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Ole Hanson was Mayor of Seattle from his election in March 1918 until his resignation in August 1919. He is important to the Seattle General Strike primarily because it made him a short-lived national celebrity.</P>
<P>Hanson, the son of Norwegian immigrants, moved to Seattle from Wisconsin with his wife and children in 1902, when he was twenty-eight. He set up a reasonably successful real estate business and occasionally dabbled in politics, most notably as a labor-friendly representative in the 1909 State Legislature. With his comfortable middle-of-the-road politics and his impressive oratory, he won the 1918 mayoral election by a wide margin.</P>
<P>Despite his previous warmth for labor issues, he took a strong stance against the strike, issuing anti-strike proclamations to the strikers, the citizens of Seattle and the nation at large. When the strike ended without mishap in less than a week, the public, the media, and fellow politicians gave Hanson full credit. Taking pains to stoke local and national newspapers with self-congratulatory fuel, Hanson shot to immediate political superstardom. By all accounts, most Americans in 1919 thought Hanson a hero of the highest order, while union men considered him worse than vermin.</P>
<P>Six months after the strike Hanson resigned from office, claiming illness and poverty. He toured the country, writing and lecturing about the Seattle Strike and against "Bolshevism." He enjoyed laudatory fame and monetary success for about a year, even entertaining a possible presidential candidacy, before he fell back into obscurity as quickly as he had shot to celebrity.</P>
<P>The most interesting thing about Hanson is his relationship with the media and the public during his brief explosion of popularity. His handling of the strike really wasn’t all that impressive one way or the other. His actions were neither heroic nor villainous. What is impressive is his meteoric success as a self-promoter, the near-fanaticism of his admirers, the bitter rhetoric of his detractors, and his sudden disappearance from the national stage. Everybody had something to say about Ole, but only for about fifteen minutes.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>SECONDARY SOURCES</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Really, there are no secondary sources if one is studying the public perception of Ole Hanson. There are, however, two substantial treatments that would belong in the secondary source category if one were studying Hanson himself. The first is heavily anti-Ole; perhaps more than is necessary. The second is more favorable, and is, in fact, partly a reaction to the first.</P>
<P>Robert L. Friedheim, The Seattle General Strike (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1964)</P>
<P>Terje I. Leiren, "Ole and the Reds: the ‘Americanism’ of Seattle Mayor</P>
<P>Ole Hanson" Norwegian American Studies 1985 30:75-95</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Ole Hanson, Americanism Versus Bolshevism (New York: Doubleday, Page, and Company, 1920)</P>
<P>Hanson began this 300-page book immediately after the strike. In fact, one of the reasons he resigned his office was to give him the time to finish it. Even while he was still mayor, critics said that he neglected his duties in order to work on it. The first third of it contains a brief autobiography and a necessarily one-sided account of the Seattle General Strike. The rest is a history of "Bolshevism" in Europe and in the United States and a prescription for stopping its spread. It shows the intensity of his opinions and hints at his skill as an orator.</P>
<P>Delores Huteson Hughes, "The Impractical Dreamer," an unpublished</P>
<P>manuscript by Hanson’s granddaughter, in Manuscripts and Archives,</P>
<P>University of Washington Libraries</P>
<P>Evidently a school paper, this is written in a worshipful tone. It gives valuable information about Hanson’s doings after his popularity faded. He squandered his lecture tour money, then made a small fortune in Mexican oil and founded the Southern California city of San Clemente.</P>
<P>Friedheim Collection, Manuscripts and Archives, University of Washington</P>
<P>Libraries</P>
<P>Compiled by Friedheim while he was working on his book, this collection deals with the Seattle General Strike as a whole. The most interesting item devoted to Hanson is a copy of the transcript of People vs. Lloyd, a trial in which Hanson was an expert witness. Hanson retells his role in the strike and talks about his lecture tour. He is verbally thrashed by Clarence Darrow.</P>
<B><I><P>Washington State Newspapers</P>
</B></I><P>Hanson dominated just about all of the local newspapers right after the strike. The general readership newspapers were concerned with congratulating him and cataloguing his rise to prominence. Typical are the Post-Intelligencer and the Times.</P>
<B><I><P>Post-Intelligencer</P>
</B></I><P>On February 10<SUP>th</SUP>, 1919 the P-I credited Hanson for ending the strike. On the 11<SUP>th</SUP> they ran several pages of excerpts of praise for Hanson from other newspapers, both local and national. On the 15<SUP>th</SUP> they printed a speech Hanson gave to the Chamber of Commerce. On April 29<SUP>th</SUP> they described a failed bomb attempt on Hanson’s office, and August 28<SUP>th</SUP> they covered his resignation.</P>
<B><I><P>Times</P>
</B></I><P>Unlike the Post Intelligencer, the Times covered Hanson’s 1918 election quite thoroughly. On March 2, 1918 they printed a story titled "Ole Hanson’s Record," which listed his platform, accomplishments, and several letters of support. On February 10<SUP>th</SUP>, 1919 they joined the Ole parade with an enormous front-page portrait and biography. Like other newspapers, they praised him for the next few days.</P>
<B><I><P>Union Record</P>
</B></I><P>A labor daily, this paper is fun to read because it seems to be the single member of the "We Hate Ole" club. Actually, the Union Record wrote favorably about Hanson on February 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, just before the strike. On the 6<SUP>th</SUP> they seemed baffled by his antagonism, and by the 11<SUP>th</SUP> they admitted that they couldn’t print the words they would have liked to use for him. In every issue from the 11<SUP>th</SUP> to the 20<SUP>th</SUP> they found new bad things to say about him. On the 14<SUP>th</SUP> and 15<SUP>th</SUP> they printed insulting cartoons. On August 29<SUP>th</SUP>, when Hanson resigned, they devoted more front-page space to him than they had to the General strike on its first day: "Hanson Quits…City Hall Rid of Freak."</P>
<B><I><P>National Newspapers</P>
</B></I><P>As the February 11<SUP>th</SUP> P-I article chronicled, newspapers from all over the country had good things to say about Hanson right after the strike. The most complete was the New York Times, which actually beat Washington papers to the punch in Hanson praise.</P>
<B><I><P>New York Times</P>
</B></I><P>On February 8<SUP>th</SUP>, the New York Times did a story on the Seattle General Strike, but seemed most enamored of Mayor Hanson. The proclamation Hanson sent them by telegram, printed on the 9<SUP>th</SUP>, probably had a lot to do with their featuring him, and with his subsequent popularity. On the 10<SUP>th</SUP>, 11<SUP>th</SUP>, 12<SUP>th</SUP>, 13<SUP>th</SUP>, 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 15<SUP>th</SUP>, 16<SUP>th</SUP>, 18<SUP>th</SUP>, and 21<SUP>st</SUP> they quoted readers and politicians with Hanson fever. On April 29<SUP>th</SUP> they covered the bomb; on August 28<SUP>th</SUP> they covered his resignation; on September 18<SUP>th</SUP> they interviewed him; on July 22, 1920 they mentioned his testimony at the Lloyd trial, and then they never mentioned him again.</P></FONT></BODY>
