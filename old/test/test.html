  </p><p class="arial10">Aaron
  Dixon was co-founder and Captain of the Seattle chapter of the
Black Panther Party. </p>
<p class="arial10">Born in Chicago, he grew up in Seattle's Central
  District. His father worked at Boeing and both parents taught Aaron and
  his brothers the importance of fighting for social justice.&nbsp; As a
  college student at the University of Washington, Dixon played a key role
  in the formation of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the Seattle Chapter of the Student Nonviolent
  Coordinating Committee (SNCC) along with Larry Gossett and others.&nbsp; Through
  the BSU, Dixon also helped organize protests and black student
  unions at local high schools.&nbsp; In the spring of 1968, at the funeral
  of Bobby Hutton in Oakland, California, Dixon met Bobby Seale
  and later was appointed Captain of Seattleâ€™s Black Panther Party,
  the first chapter outside of Oakland. He was 19 years old.&nbsp;Dixon
  led the chapter through its first four years, then moved to Party
  national headquarters in Oakland in 1972.
  There he worked with Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, and served
for a time as bodyguard to Elaine Brown. </p>
<p class="arial10">Aaron Dixon has written an autobiography,<em> My People Are Rising: Memoir of a Black Panther Party Captain</em> (2012) published by Haymarket Press. </p>
<p class="arial10"> Aaron Dixon shared memories of his experiences
  with the Black Panther Party in videotaped interviews conducted by
  Janet Jones, Trevor Griffey, and Alex Morrow on May 2 and July 13,&nbsp; 2005.
  In these wide-ranging interviews, Dixon recalls the
  tension, violence, and excitement that surrounded the Black Panthers.&nbsp; He
  also gives a rich account of the day-to-day life of Party members
  and describes the social programs that the Panthers developed, including
  a free breakfast program for school children, legal aid and medical
clinics, pest control services, and a prison visitation program.&nbsp;</p>
