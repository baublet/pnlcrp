In Washington State, the Federal Art Project supported artists in a wide variety of endeavors. This May 30, 1937 article from the Seattle Daily Times highlights the creation of murals, sculpture, dioramas and model ships. </span>In August 1935, the Federal Government launched its most ambitious New Deal visual arts initiative, the Federal Art Project (FAP). Aimed at conserving “the talent and skills of artists who, through no fault of their own, found themselves on the relief rolls and without means to continue their work,” the FAP ultimately employed more than 5,000 men and women over an eight-year span (1935-1943).<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The FAP was one of a series of cultural initiatives launched by the Roosevelt administration during the summer of 1935. Housed within the Works Progress Administration (WPA), these creative programs were collectively known as Federal One (short for Federal Project Number One) and included the Federal Theatre Project, the Federal Writers Project, the Federal Music Project, the Historical Records Survey (originally part of the Writers Project) and the FAP. Together, they represented a key element of President Roosevelt’s “Second New Deal,” a period (1935-1938) that also witnessed the implementation of such landmark programs as Social Security and the National Labor Relations Act. </span></p>

Particularly challenging in this regard was the absence of program legislation. Created by Executive Order, the WPA lacked statutory authorization for funding and was thus subject to the annual Congressional appropriations process – a situation that not only left it exposed to political wrangling, but also hampered efforts at long term planning and year-to-year organizational consistency at the state and national levels. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

Image <em>Seattle Daily Times</em>, December 8, 1940. </span>After a boom during the 1920’s, the art market collapsed in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, with sales of both imported and American artwork decreasing some 80% over the next four years. Employment opportunities also fell significantly, with the number of artists and teachers of art declining by 9.2% in the 1930’s, even while the population as a whole increased by 7.2%.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Artists supported by the FAP were active in a wide variety of areas, including traditional pursuits, like easel painting, as well as more novel (for the era) fields like community education and the documentation of folk art. Over the course of 8 years, FAP artists produced some 108,000 paintings, 17,700 sculptures, 11,200 print designs, 35,000 poster designs and 2,500 murals.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

These institutions, among the first to teach painting, sculpture and design outside the setting of a college or university, exposed millions of Americans to the theory and practice of art. The FAP also was responsible for creating the Index of American Design, a massive program of research, which sought to document the breadth of the nation’s material culture, cataloging over 22,000 items and producing a series of guides outlining the techniques used in the creation of various traditional arts and crafts.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

On September, 29, 1938, the<em> Spokesman-Review</em> ran a story on the soon to be opened Spokane Art Center. It highlighted the community's contribution to the project as well as the caliber of work, which would soon be on display for citizens to view free of charge. In the image above, Washington State Federal Art Project Director R. Bruce Inverarity (at left) and Spokane Art Center Director Carl Morris mount a painting by Warren Weelock, an artist from New York. Among the most successful FAP-organized centers in the country, the Spokane Art Center welcomes thousands of local residents through it doors during its brief few years of existence. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In general, the FAP allowed more flexibility in subject matter and style than the Treasury Department’s <a href="Section.shtml">Section of Painting and Sculpture</a>, a  program best known for sponsoring thousands of murals in post offices and courthouses. While similar themes, including regionalism, history, labor and folklore, dominated in both initiatives, FAP administrators did not require as strict an adherence to the precepts of the “American Scene” movement as their counterparts in the Section. For example, Seattle artist Fay Chong, who participated in the FAP for a number of years remembered that, “…fortunately I was very free to do what I wanted to do as far as subject matter; I had my choice, which was very good, and the same way with my printmaking. I think I had a choice there, too, but there was of course a time requirement that we had to produce so many prints or so many paintings in a certain time, you see, but I suppose that is a necessity for a project or for any kind of organization.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Another significant difference lay in the structure of each program. Centrally managed in Washington, D.C., the Section had little to no official footprint in individual states. In contrast, the FAP, a much larger program in terms of employment, developed regional and state bureaucracies, both of which exercised a fair amount of control over project selection, artist recruitment and program direction. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">This de-centralization, while perhaps allowing for more flexibility, also led to conflicts with local officials, especially those within the existing WPA state structure, who resented the intrusion of Washington D.C. appointed administrators onto their terrain. Such was the case in Washington, which was among the last states in the country to set up an Art Project due to internal bickering among various WPA managers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

Then WPA State Administrator George Gannon did not support the project, believing it to be a worthless investment, given the fact that, in his words, “there are only 20 artists in the whole state and eighteen of them cannot turn out a class of work that would justify employing them as artists.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

In this image, from the May 1939 edition of <em>Indians at Work</em>, a publication of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Uinta Ute artist Julius Twohy stands on scaffolding while painting a mural at Cushman Indian Hospital<span class="style11"> </span>in Tacoma. Twohy was the only Native artist to participate in the Federal Art Project in Washington State. </span>One particular mural, "The Flight of the Thunderbird," garnered significant attention, including a story in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and over a dozen mentions in various Washington media outlets. Created for the Cushman Indian Hospital (a federal facility located on Puyallup Tribal land in Tacoma) by Uinta Ute artist Julius Twohy, the impressive 72-foot painting presented the story of the Thunderbird from the perspective of various indigenous peoples. Traveling from west to east (left to right) across the wall, Twohy's Thunderbird moves through different regions and cultures, shifting appearance and meaning for each group it encounters. On the far left is a figure that evokes the Northwest Coast, a Thunderbird that might appear on a Totem from British Columbia, followed by symbols and imagery often associated with the Great Basin, Southwest (a loom), Plains (tipi and horses) and Great Lakes (water and canoes). In each locale, according to an interview with the artist, the Thunderbird appears to chiefs and medicine men (also depicted in the mural) providing instruction and spiritual guidance.</span></span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:

Built using the dam’s actual blueprints in a workshop in the Terminal Sales Building in Seattle, the model featured a “real concrete Diablo Dam, a mountainside and a riverbed, and running water, all in a space eight feet long and six feet wide.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;

    During a 1937 visit to Washington State, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt examined the work of "an old ship captain" employed by the FAP as a maker of model ships. During her stop, Mrs. Roosevelt asked multiple questions regarding the project's activities and said she "hated to go" before leaving to address the city council and King County Commission. </span></span></span>In 1939, the structure of the WPA (and by extension the Federal One programs ) changed dramatically. The newly created Federal Works Agency (FWA) assumed management of all WPA programs, thereby eliminating the agency's status as an independent entity. The Works Progress Administration soon became the Work Projects Administration, reflecting the FWA's heightened emphasis on results and accountability. With shifts in management came changes in support and funding. The Federal Theatre Project, long under attack by the right-wing, was eliminated, while the other Federal One programs suffered deep cuts in their Federal allocations. Control shifted to the states and, as a result, the Federal Art Project in Washington State became the Washington Art Project, with the University of Washington becoming the official sponsor, though the federal government still contributed a majority of funds. Work continued, though morale suffered in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere as a result of the changes. In these later years, Inverarity, who remained Director until the Project's end in 1942, was able to initiate a few new programs, including an ambitious effort to open small art galleries and exhibition spaces across the state, so that residents of smaller towns and rural areas could enjoy exposure to art. A <em>Seattle Daily Times</em> article from September 7,1939 announcing the shift in management stressed that the program would continue its mission of "the fostering art talent and the teaching of art to the underprivileged."</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"> Over the course of 8 years, the Federal Art Project aided thousands of needy artists and craftspeople, including dozens in Washington State. Like other Americans, artists were struggling to survive the Great Depression, searching for any kind of gainful employment amidst the greatest economic calamity the nation had ever known. As a result of the WPA's Federal One initiative, men and women engaged in creative work like design, painting, writing, theatre and music, were able to contribute their skills, knowledge and know-how to society during a critical moment of change and uncertainty. Whether it was painting classes in a community center, high quality murals in a local high school or the opening of a rural gallery, the Federal Art Project connected art and artists to the public in new and innovative ways. Like other New Deal programs, the Art Project often suffered from bureaucratic in-fighting and a lack formal administrative structure, but, despite these difficulties, it ultimately succeeded bringing art to the people and inspiring an enduring interest in the field among a generation of Americans.</span></p>
