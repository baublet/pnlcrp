      <P class=arial10>"DEEDS Background and Basics: A Report on Research Leading to the Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown Seattle," compiled by CORE member and University of Washington Anthropology professor Charles A. Valentine is an eye-opening study of employment discrimination in Seattle during the 1960s. Issued in October 1964, the report was the fruit of months of research by CORE volunteers observing and documenting the extent of discrimination among downtown businesses. </P>
      <p class="arial10">Dr. Bettylou Valentine, a CORE founder and wife of Charles Valentine, edited the abridged version of the report that appears below. The full 64 page report is available in pdf form at right. </p>
      <p class="style3">Editor's note: </p>
      <p class="arial10"><em> The DEEDS report excerpted here demonstrates the level of research and thought that went into CORE's approach: Is there discrimination? What are the details of it? Investigation had at least a two-fold purpose: first, to allow discussion with employers using facts and without rancor or malice, and second, to use facts as a basis for recommending changes. Creative reconciliation was always the hoped for result of CORE's research. As one of Seattle CORE's most active investigators put it, &quot;Proposals [and action] designed to bring about an integrated society must be founded on knowledge and understanding of the relevant facts.&quot; </em></p>
      <p class="arial10"><em> &nbsp;How to obtain the relevant facts varied greatly. In some cases data could already be found in academic studies or reports of various agencies. In some cases CORE conducted its own on-the-spot research. In the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. world of the 1960s it was possible to station one or more people at the employees entrance(s)of a firm to actually count employees entering, behind the counter, on the elevators and often in the offices as well. On some occasions CORE members trained by university faculty and provided with prepared survey questionnaires took their research directly to the supervisor or manager. Sympathetic faculty members and students in anthropology, sociology, geography, social work and the law school enabled Seattle CORE to be quite sophisticated in its investigations as did friends on state federal and municipal boards and commissions. </em></p>

      <p align="left" class="arial10"><strong>BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"><strong>A National Problem on the Seattle Scene </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Minority peoples striving for advancement within American society as we know it have one basic need which they face directly and constantly, and which often lies beneath their other problems as well: the need for more and better jobs. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), as well as other groups working in the interests of those who are victimized by discrimination, have long recognized this need. The problem is national in scope and is compounded by a history stretching back for generations. </p>
      <p class="arial10">The city of Seattle is by no means exempt from the nationwide problems of job discrimination. It is no accident that the first action project undertaken by Seattle CORE, now more than three years ago, was an effort to open jobs for Negroes where employment had previously been closed by discriminatory hiring practices. Nor should it come as any surprise that since then Seattle CORE has put considerably more energy into the drive for equal employment opportunity than any other phase of the struggle for civil rights and an integrated society. </p>
      <p class="arial10">This effort has achieved some important and worthwhile results. Working either on its own or in concert with other organizations, Seattle CORE has dealt with one employer after another. Methods employed have ranged from careful investigation and patient negotiation to dramatic direct action. Out of these years of hard work have come several hundred jobs opened up to Seattle Negro working in supermarkets, department stores, banks, bakeries, milk companies, utilities, apparel stores, and other businesses. These results have been achieved without ever calling for the displacement of any existing employee, for that would be entirely contrary to CORE policy. </p>
      <p class="arial10">Yet today it remains painfully obvious to Seattle&rsquo;s Negro citizens that this city is far from achieving equality of opportunity in employment. Readers who have not experienced this directly may learn from the latest census figures that Negroes hold approximately 8,400 jobs in the Seattle Metropolitan Area, whereas if they were employed in proportion to their numbers their share would be approximately 10,500 paid positions. </p>
      <p class="arial10">This racial deficit of more than 2,000 jobs also reflects the fact that unemployment has steadily remained, over a good may years, twice as high among Seattle Negroes as for the general population of the city. During the past year, for example, Negro unemployment varied seasonally from 10% to 16%, while for the same period the labor force of the whole city was only 5-8% unemployed. </p>
      <p class="arial10">The general economic position of the Negro minority as indicated by annual income is also closely related to the employment situation. Negro family incomes average 20% lower than white incomes in Seattle. To appreciate the poverty indicated by these figures one must also remember that the Negro families who live on these inadequate incomes are much larger than white families. For example, the 1960 census shows that Seattle Negroes have 56% more children below the age of five than do the whites of the city. </p>
      <p class="arial10">Many places of employment remain completely closed to Negroes; many more have Negro workers only in the most menial positions. All too many employers who seemed to indicate to CORE and other groups that they were ready to make a start toward integration have failed to progress beyond token desegregation. When pressed, hiring agencies regularly claim that qualified minority workers cannot be found. Yet many Negroes employed in lowly positions fail to be advance while white workers with no better qualifications move up through the ranks, and many able Negroes are unable to find work while thousands of whites walk into positions requiring little or no training or experience. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"> Repeatedly CORE has had to return to the same employers who have failed to live up to their expressed commitment to integration or have not carried out earlier equal opportunity agreements. The vicious circle of job discrimination has not been broken in Seattle. Modest gains made here and there are completely overshadowed by the city-wide pattern of discrimination and the economic dead weight of Negro unemployment, so productive of other social ills. In short, despite a very great expenditure of energy, effort, and goodwill, Seattle has had no breakthrough in jobs for Negroes. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"><strong> The Growth of the Downtown Project </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> This challenging situation became a major topic of discussion at a weekend seminar held by Seattle CORE in May, 1964, in order to take stock of its current programs and consider future directions. At this time it was suggested that the frustrating failure to achieve a breakthrough in employment might be at least partly a result of dealing in piecemeal fashion with one employer at a time. Proposals were advanced for approaching whole industries, and suggestions were made for tackling other larger segments of the entire employment picture. </p>
   
      <p class="arial10"> Finally the idea was proposed that CORE approach the whole economic and governmental complex of downtown Seattle as a unit. This seemed to be a target with several immediately obvious advantages. Many thousands of jobs in great variety exist in the area, and the existence of discrimination is well known from sources as diverse as hearings by the State Board Against Discrimination, the United Press International economic survey, and personal experience on the part of CORE members. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"> As in many American cities, the downtown area is economically vulnerable because so much business has shifted to suburbs and shopping centers in recent years, and business interests have therefore set up the Central Association of Seattle to plan and organize its development. Partly because of its proximity to the Negro residential concentration in the Central Area, the downtown business district is the principal natural area for Negro shoppers. Being the governmental center as well as the business hub of the city, the area is both a natural focus for public attention and the apparent headquarters of Seattle&rsquo;s power structure. These and other factors were discussed as the idea of a downtown project began to take shape. </p>
   
      <p class="arial10"><strong> The Emergence of DEEDS </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> CORE initiated the community-wide Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown Seattle &ndash; abbreviated DEEDS. The goal of the drive is 1200 new jobs for Negroes downtown. Actively participating in DEEDS along with CORE are the Central Area Committee on Civil Rights, the Seattle branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Seattle Urban League, the Catholic Interracial Council, the Baptist Ministers Alliance, the Methodist Episcopal Ministers Alliance, and other groups. These organizations have been represented in the negotiations with downtown employers, and they are actively engaged in contacting the community and publicizing DEEDS. Organizations that have more recently joined in DEEDS include the Unitarians for Social Justice, the University of Washington Civil Rights Action Group, and the Ship Scalers Union 541. </p>
     
      <p align="left" class="arial10 style2"> THE CORE STUDY OF DOWNTOWN SEATTLE </p>
      <p align="left" class="arial10"><strong> Purposes and approaches </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> In order that the downtown project would have a firm factual foundation a great deal of information had to be discovered. The numbers and proportions of Negroes actually working in a great many different positions with a huge variety of employers had to be known as accurately as possible. It was necessary to know the size and importance of the role played by Negroes as downtown consumers. Much had to be learned about the economic feasibility of bringing more Negroes into the downtown work force without displacing any present downtown workers. Many other facts were needed to determine how pressure might best be brought to bear on those responsible for hiring practices, should this prove necessary. </p>
   
      <p class="arial10"> Some of this information can be found in published and other written sources through careful research. Indeed, as it turned out, the broad picture of job inequality in Seattle, together with many related social and economic facets of the city&rsquo;s life, can be amply documented from government, business, and university reports. </p>
     
      <p class="arial10"> A team of approximately thirty CORE members, varying slightly in personnel during the course of the study, carried out the basic work of survey and research over a period of two months, June and July, 1964. These individuals brought a most useful diversity of backgrounds and talents to the project. Several of them work downtown in a wide variety of occupations and have considerable knowledge of employment in the area. Six are social scientists or other specialists professionally concerned with the problems of the city as a human community. Another half-dozen are university students, while about an equal number are pupils in senior high schools. Several are housewives who are active in community affairs and have had experience with work similar to this. Others work or have recently worked in the downtown area at skilled trades or service occupations. There are both Negro and white members of the group in each of these categories. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Research </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Three or four members of the study group who are familiar with local libraries, and who have worked with the general kinds of written sources involved here, carried out most of the background research during the first few weeks of the study. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"> The repositories of documentary evidence most used included the Seattle Public Library and the Library of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Particularly useful was the University of Washington Library, including such specialized divisions as the Northwest Collection and the Business administration Library. Other agencies of the University from which valuable information was obtained are the Office of Population Research and the Bureau of Government Research. </p>

      <p class="arial10"> Perhaps the single most useful group of sources were the various relevant publications of the U.S. Census Bureau, including particularly the Census of Population and Housing and the Census of Business for Seattle. Among other federal agencies whose publications proved revealing was the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Washington State Employment Security Department publishes at frequent intervals much useful general information on trends in labor and business. </p>
    
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Direct Investigation </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Between the third week in June and the latter part of July, the study group surveyed intensively those aspects of downtown economic life which seemed most pertinent and most in need of facts to add to the library research materials. Twenty-four members of the group took part in this effort which was divided into four phases. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The first of these phases was a retail employment survey. Each business that met the following criteria was visited and observed: (1) located wholly or partly on the street level, (2) open to the public at the time of survey, (3) more than two or three employees in evidence, (4) no great amount of information already available from other sources. Some of the largest retail employers were eliminated from the survey by the last criterion because CORE negotiation reports contained full information on them. In addition to the establishments that conform to these criteria, a sizeable sample of smaller establishments and a few good sized retail outlets on upper floors were also covered. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"> The majority of businesses visited and observed were retail outlets of one kind or another including department stores, apparel shops, drug stores, hardware dealers, food shops, jewelry stores, furniture and appliance dealers, and many others. Also included were a certain number of service establishments, restaurants, hotels, parking lots or garages, banks, wholesale dealers, and other kinds of businesses located in the retail area. Altogether more than 200 establishments in the retail core were surveyed. </p>
   
      <p class="arial10"> At each place of employment all observable employees were recorded. The race of each worker counted was specified as white, Negro or Oriental. In all but a small number of doubtful cases each worker was classified in a fairly broad occupational category such as sales staff, management, janitor, or waitress. Wherever possible, special efforts were made to observe personnel in back rooms, on upper floors, or otherwise beyond the view of the casual visitor. Over 1,300 workers of all kinds were recorded in the retail area. </p>

      <p class="arial10"> The second phase of the survey dealt with privately employed office personnel working in a sample of eight major office buildings within the downtown office area as defined by the City Planning Commission and the Central Association. </p>
    
      <p class="arial10"> In this part of the survey a method of observation similar to that just described was adapted to establishments made up largely or entirely of offices. For six office buildings this meant visiting every office to which access could be gained. In the two remaining buildings this technique was replaced by interviewing members of the building management staff. Approximately 9,000 employees in office establishments were counted, recorded, and classified both by race and by broad occupational grouping. </p>

      <p class="arial10"> In the third phase, similar observations were made of downtown workers employed by all levels of government from federal and state to county and municipal. Here the investigation concentrated on the major public buildings: the Federal Court House and Federal Office Building, the County Court House, the Municipal and Public </p>
      <p class="arial10"> Safety Buildings and City Light. Only in the cases of a few specific agencies was it possible to extend the survey to field staffs or street crews working out of downtown government headquarters. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The final phase of investigation by observation was a customer survey carried out by fourteen members of the group in July. Here the team returned to the downtown retail core and surveyed customers using typical establishments of the area. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The procedure here was for investigators to observe all customer entrances and record each shopper going in as white, Negro, or other nonwhite. Periods of observation ranged from one to three hours, and wherever possible more than one observing session was devoted to each establishment. An effort was made to choose representative times of day for these observations, with emphasis on the heavy shopping periods of early evening. Altogether a little more than 6,650 shoppers were recorded. </p>
   
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Compiling, Analyzing, and Evaluating Information </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> This study involved little in the way of specialized methods. Members of the team with training and experience in social surveys or similar research gave instructions and made suggestions on procedures for data gathering. Broadly standardized techniques of observation were agreed upon. At the same time, investigators were encouraged to be flexible and to use their ingenuity. A number of spot checks produced a feeling of confidence in the reliability of the fact finding procedures. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"> For the most part, only the simplest statistical methods were employed and in general a straightforward form of analysis relying considerably on common sense was used to find order and meaning in the growing array of facts. At the same time, however, technical advice was sought when members of the team felt it was needed. Thus on a number of occasions professional statisticians, demographers market analysts, and economists were consulted at the University of Washington and at one or two local government agencies. </p>
  
      <p class="arial10"> In some three months of negotiation and debate no one has seriously challenged the main body of facts brought to light by this study. It seems that the validity of the study is reasonably satisfactory. Those of us who have searched elsewhere for the kind of information needed are convinced of one point: no comparable body of facts and analysis dealing with the role of the Negro in Seattle&rsquo;s economy is available from other sources. It appears that in spite of all its limitations this work will have to stand as the principal source of such information until some organization or institution with greater resources than CORE undertakes a less limited investigation in the same area. </p>
    
      <p align="left" class="arial10"><strong> NEGROES IN DOWNTOWN EMPLOYMENT </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Private Employment as a Whole </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Evidence from the federal census indicates that of the 55,000 job holders working for private employers in Downtown Seattle only about 1,600 or less than 3% are Negroes. (The principal comparison that gives these figures meaning, or course, is the fact that Negroes make up 5% of the city&rsquo;s population.) Direct investigation by CORE, plus evidence collected by the State Board Against Discrimination in a few special areas, covered over 16,500 employees of all races or nearly one third (31%) of all workers in private employment. Among the job holders thus surveyed by CORE and the State Board less than 2% were Negroes, and of the few Negro workers found almost half (49%) were in menial positions. </p>
 
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Retail Employment </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> The retail trade is an important segment of the downtown economy for underemployed minorities. It accounts for one fourth of all existing jobs in the area. It includes a great many reasonably dignified sales and other positions which carry moderately good salaries but do not require a great deal of specialized training. The retail businesses are also among the potions of the downtown economy most directly and substantially supported by Negro spending. </p>
   
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Clerical and General Office Work </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> The 18,000 office personnel working for private employers in downtown office buildings are the largest single category of workers in the whole area. This type of employment has a high rate of turnover, and it takes in large numbers of high school graduates and other new entrants into the labor force, especially young women, each year. The claims of some that opportunities for minority workers are increasing significantly in Seattle are seriously challenged by the fact that Negroes are grossly under-represented in this large and rapidly changing group of employees. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> It appears from census data that somewhat less than 3% of all personnel working for private office establishments are Negroes. Again, however, the more detailed findings of the CORE survey reveal an even more discriminatory pattern. It seems that most of the Negro clerical workers recorded by the census are to be found either in a few firms which are special cases, such as the telephone company, or in the familiar out-of-sight occupations. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Banks, Real Estate, and Finance </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Overlapping slightly with the last group of workers is the next largest employment category. This is the 6,500 or so people who work for downtown banks, real estate offices, lending agencies, insurance companies, and other financial concerns. As far as overall numbers are concerned, this is the major group of employers that has by all odds the poorest record for hiring minority group members. In spite of recent, rather widely advertised exercises in token desegregation, it is doubtful that more than 1% of all personnel in the employ of such businesses are Negroes. And again, although a few attractive Negro girls have lately begun to appear behind teller&rsquo;s windows, following certain initiatives taken by civil rights groups both locally and nationally, the majority of Negroes in this segment of the economy are still confined to pushing a broom or some similar occupation. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Hotels, Restaurants, and Entertainment </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> The various occupations followed by the men and women who staff eating places, drinking establishment, amusements and entertainment, hotels and motels are good examples of how job discrimination works even where substantial numbers of Negroes are employed. In the downtown area some 4,500 people work for these related industries and Negroes make up better than 6% of this work force, which of course means that the minority is present in numbers slightly more than proportional to its strength within the city&rsquo;s population. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> On the other hand, these areas of employment also include many jobs that are low in status and poorly paid, and it is in just such positions that the great majority of Negro employees are to be found. In a survey of over 2,000 restaurant workers in more than 65 eating places, the State Board Against Discrimination found not a single Negro in any managerial post, not one in any of the choice service positions such as hostess, cashier, or check girl, and not even a single Negro waitress. At the same time, however, fully 14% of all dishwashers in the restaurants surveyed turned out to be Negroes. Most striking of all, every single restaurant janitor reported was a Negro. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> The Taxicab Companies </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> One smaller category of private employment deserves mention. The three largest taxi companies in Seattle employ a total of nearly 700 drivers. Their hiring policies were recently subjected to a State Board inquiry, confirmed by CORE investigators and negotiators, and even admitted by the employers involved. While one of these companies has 35 Negroes driving its cabs, the other two do not have and have never had a single Negro driver. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> This case is instructive because, with a substantial number of Negroes performing successfully for one firm the very work from which they are excluded by the others, it demonstrates with unusual clarity the inadequacy of the usual explanations given by discriminatory employers. The most frequent of these pseudo-explanations are that Negroes do not apply for employment, that qualified Negroes cannot be found, and that having Negro employees would drive customers away. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Government Employment as a Whole </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> It will perhaps not be a surprise that in general the record of downtown government agencies as employers of minority workers is no better than that of private employers. The only substantial exception to this generalization, as we shall see, is the enlightening example of the federal government, whose agencies on the local scene have hiring policies that are largely determined by authorities far from Seattle. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Municipal Government </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Various segments of the city&rsquo;s municipal work force, surveyed by a variety of organizations using different methods of investigation, appear to have Negro complements ranging from well under 1% to some 2 &frac12; %. The United Press International economic survey for 1964 reports that the composition of the city&rsquo;s clerical employees, the municipal police force, and the fire department are all less than 1% Negro. CORE investigators diligently surveying the Municipal Building and the Public Safety Building were able to find only a handful of minority workers in each location. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Because it is a municipal agency with a large number and considerable variety of jobs to offer, City Light was subjected to careful scrutiny by CORE personnel. This investigation covered not only employees housed in the downtown headquarters but also field crews that work in various part of the city. It appears that among the more than 2,000 men and women working for City Light a generous estimate would say that 30 individuals or about 1 &frac12;% are Negroes. Of these, more than half are essentially unskilled laborers or janitorial workers, and less that half fall into the combined categories of office staff, clerical employees, skilled tradesmen, and semi-skilled workers. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> In the police force throughout the city CORE was able to discover only three patrolmen, one sergeant, and one detective who are Negroes. Inquiry into the composition of the Fire Department yielded one Negro fireman and one lineman who also works part time for the Police Department. While the CORE survey did not give equal attention to all municipal agencies, it was able to identify positively only 56 Negroes working for the city altogether. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The Port of Seattle is a public agency which is staffed by nearly 300 job holders. Its personnel cover a considerable variety of skills. An investigation carried out earlier this year by the State Board Against Discrimination revealed that the Port has just six Negro employees, that is 2% of the total. Still more interesting is the occupational composition of this Negro work force: one messenger, four members of the janitorial staff, and one head janitor. (It should be added that after this information was made public the Port hired a Negro I.B.M. machine operator.) The port authority is also another public agency which subsidizes discrimination beyond its own payroll. It has done this by awarding airport and ferry terminal franchises to the same taxi companies which are long known to have excluded Negro drivers. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> County Government </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> A good many of the operations and much of the work force of the King County government are centralized downtown in the County Court House. The absence of minority group members and offices of this building has long been notable. The CORE survey observed and classified approximately 550 employees at the Court House. These included a grand total of three Negroes: one clerk-typist, one lunch counter worker, and one cleanup man. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> During the negotiations with employers which grew out of the findings reported here, a representative of the county government estimated that between 4% and 5% of all county employees are Negroes. One further inquiry, however, the county spokesman stated that most of these people are unskilled workers, only a few are clerical employees, and practically none have supervisory positions. It would appear that most of the Negroes who work for the county are day laborers, plus a certain number of young people hired under special programs during the summer, and the great majority of them are located outside downtown Seattle where most of the more desirable county jobs are to be found. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> State Agencies </p>
      <p class="arial10"> Less than 100 Negroes working for the State could be discovered in other parts of the Seattle Metropolitan Area. Most of these are concentrated in a few agencies, the Department of Public Assistance and the Liquor Control Board alone accounting for substantially more than half of this total. A good many of them are also either workers at low levels or part time employees. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Federal Agencies </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> The one sizeable bright spot for Negro employment in downtown Seattle is provided by the U.S. Government. Census evidence indicates that federal agencies located in the Downtown Area have some 4,500 employees and about 450, or 10% these are Negroes. Not only is this by far the highest percentage of Negro workers to be found in any major category, but the absolute number involved is sufficiently great so that it makes the difference between less than 3% and nearly 3 &frac12;% Negroes as the total record for all downtown employment, both public and private. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> As in other aspects of the negotiations that grew out of the work reported here, federal negotiators were by far the most cooperative and helpful of all employers&rsquo; representatives in providing information on their employed personnel. Although the figures they provided do not distinguish between federal establishments located in the downtown area and those located elsewhere in the city, they do generally confirm the picture outlined above. This information was provided by representatives of the federal Executive Board which has responsibilities in relation to hiring policies in all U.S. Government agencies in the city. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> According to this source, as of July, 1964, 1,022 Negroes were working in all branches of federal service within the city limits. This is 9.8% of the total of nearly 10,500 federal personnel in Seattle. This overall Negro representation breaks down into 13.5% in the Post Office and a little better than 6% in all other agencies. On the basis of information from the same source, in all federal employment excluding the Post Office, 54% of the Negroes on the payroll are unskilled laborers or skilled tradesmen, 39% are clerical workers and only 6% are technical or professional employees. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Despite the fact that further improvements could be made here, the record of the U.S. government as an employer in Seattle has an important meaning from another point of view. The evident contrast between federal employment practices and those of all other major categories of employers shows that the general pattern of discriminatory hiring is neither inevitable nor unchangeable. The federal record demonstrates that Negroes can be successfully employed in much greater numbers than they have been outside the federal agencies, and it shows that Negroes can work effectively in many more highly paid and responsible positions than private enterprise, state or local government has seen fit to grant them. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> NEGROES AS DOWNTOWN CONSUMERS </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Downtown Seattle is the principal area to which Negroes go for retail shopping, commercial and personal services, entertainment, and amusement. The existence of this pattern is confirmed by the Puget Sound Transportation Survey which has shown a significantly larger proportion of shopping trips from the largely Negro residential neighborhoods in the Central Area to the downtown district than from other parts of the city. In short, it is well established that Negroes are the downtown area&rsquo;s best customers in the sense of providing the largest number of potential spenders in proportion to their population strength. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Since the amount of money actually spent downtown by Negroes cannot be surveyed directly by observation, it must be calculated indirectly from other information. The annual median family income of Seattle Negroes, according to census data, is a little over $5,500 or about 80% of the corresponding figure for whites which is nearly $7,000. This means that Negroes as a group control approximately 4% of the total purchasing power in the city. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Several considerations make it clear that this group accounts for substantially more than 4% of the spending that occurs downtown. In addition to the disproportionate number of Negro shoppers downtown, there is the general fact that people in lower income brackets spend a higher proportion of their income on immediate needs including the retail purchases that Negroes make mainly in the downtown area. Total downtown retail sales now amount to some $275 million per year. Since 4% of this figure is $11 million, it seems that the most conservative estimate than can reasonably be made of annual downtown retail spending by Negroes is about $12 million. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> It this seems impossible to escape the conclusion that Negroes spend well over $12,000,000 a year in downtown Seattle. Whatever the actual amount may be, this is a very substantial contribution to the prosperity of the area, a contribution which downtown business cannot afford to lose. It is clear from these figures that the injustice suffered by Negroes in being denied an equal share of downtown employment is compounded by the fact that they give much more than a proportional share to the profits and progress of that same economic community. </p>
       
      <p align="left" class="arial10"><strong> THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS TO IMPROVE NEGRO EMPLOYMENT </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> An obvious question arises from the comparison made between the U.S. government and other downtown employers set forth at the end of the previous section. If the federal government can raise both the quantity and the quality of Negro employment well beyond present local norms, why can&rsquo;t other employers do the same? The basic answer that emerges from the research reported here is that the downtown economic community can hire more Negroes in better jobs whenever it really decides to do so. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> This raises the further question, what has made the difference between the employment record of U.S. government agencies and all the other major groups of employers? Probably the most important single distinction which sets the federal government apart in this respect is a clearcut policy that requires all agencies to create greater opportunities for minority employees. Despite a certain amount of lip service to the principle of equal opportunity, it is clear that there is no such firm and definite policy in operation across the board in any other major sector of the downtown employing community. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The problem remains to determine what are the limits of economic reality within which practical results might be expected from such a change in employment policy. The CORE research team therefore gave careful attention to available information on job turnover and economic growth in downtown Seattle as well as the labor supply which might be available to fill new positions if increased opportunities were opened up to Negroes. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Growth of the Downtown Economy </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Census information, economic studies done at the University of Washington School of business administration, and research results published by businessmen&rsquo;s groups all show that in downtown Seattle economic activity in general and employment in particular have grown during recent years and are continuing to grow at the present time. This means that expansion of total employment opportunities can provide one avenue for equalizing the opportunities available to Negroes. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The most comprehensive figures available on downtown economic growth have been published by the Central Association of Seattle, a businessmen&rsquo;s group devoted to the interests of the downtown business community and including several hundred leading downtown companies as member firms. According to this source, some 400-500 new jobs have been created annually for the last eight years, adding up to a total of 3,000-4,000 newly created positions in the downtown area since 1956. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Furthermore, the Central Association predicts that between 1,000 and 2,000 new jobs will be added to downtown payrolls each year from 1964 to 1985, bringing total employment in the area to nearly 85,000 within approximately ten years. It thus appears that the downtown business community presently has somewhere between 500 and 1,000 entirely new jobs per year that it could work with in equalizing employment opportunities for members of all races. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> The Negro labor Force </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> It is a measure of Seattle&rsquo;s lack of interest in the problems of its minority communities that little is known about the Negro labor force beyond what can be extracted from federal census reports. Civil rights groups such as CORE do not have the resources to study this group of some 12,000 persons in detail. The local government agencies, research organizations, and civic groups that could carry out such a study have not seen fit to do so. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Census figures do provide a general picture of the employed portion of the Negro labor force in the Seattle Metropolitan Area as of 1960. Barely over 10% of these employed Negroes hold professional or managerial positions, while nearly 30% of employed whites are found in these same occupations. No more than 12% of working Negroes have clerical or sales jobs, as compared with nearly one third of the white working population. The disproportion is reversed in the crafts and skilled worker&rsquo;s positions which account for virtually 30% of the employed Negroes and only a quarter of working whites. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Occupational inequality is most obvious at the level of unskilled and semi-skilled work: nearly half (48%) of all Negro employees subsist at this level, in contract to a mere 15% of white workers. Negroes are most dramatically over-represented in such occupations as unskilled labor, domestic work, and janitorial service. The same pattern is reflected in the fact that median personal income for Negroes stats at a figure but little above $2,500 per year, approximately 25% below the comparable figure for whites. These statistics have probably improved slightly since 1960, but it is doubtful that the improvement has been significant. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> It is customary for employers and others to explain this pattern by the contention that Negroes do not possess the necessary education or skills for the higher level, better paid occupational positions. This is at best only a partial explanation. It is true that there is an educational gap: as of 1960 only 35% of Seattle Negroes had completed high school, while some 55% of whites had done so. In the same year the median number of school years completed by persons 14 and over was 10.4 for Negroes as compared with 12.2 for whites. This gap has apparently narrowed somewhat in the nearly five years since these figures were compiled. Even at the 1960 level, however, such figures will hardly explain the fact that proportionally three times as many Negroes as whites work as laborers, while whites are almost equally overrepresented in professional and managerial jobs at the other end of the scale. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> In addition to these considerations, Seattle&rsquo;s unemployed are a major resource from which Negro employment downtown could be augmented. The unemployment rate in the metropolitan area has been consistently twice as high for Negroes as for other workers in recent years, and the Negro rate has risen to above 15% in the current year. This means that during 1963-64 there have been up to a seasonal maximum of approximately 2,000 unemployed Negroes in Seattle and probably not less than 1,200 Negroes unemployed at any season. This is worth noting that these people are classified as unemployed by the census definition which is essentially &ldquo;out of a job but actively seeking work.&rdquo; </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> In summary then, there is ample scope within the practical realities of Seattle&rsquo;s economic life for a rapid shift away from the racial imbalance of downtown employment and a prompt start on a genuine policy of equal opportunity. It is to be expected that within a year well over 5,000 new hires will be made by downtown employers, including the filling of some 500-1,000 new jobs created by economic growth. A great many of these positions could well be filled from the sizeable reservoir of under-employed and unemployed Negroes. This need never pose any threat to the jobs of existing downtown employees. </p>
       
      <p align="left" class="arial10"><strong> EMPLOYMENT GOALS </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> When the information reported in the preceding sections had been gathered, subjected to preliminary analysis, and reported to the CORE membership; it was possible to move on to the next phase of the downtown project. This was the task of working out specific goals the achievement of which would significantly reduce the facial imbalance in downtown employment. The downtown committee and the executive board of Seattle CORE jointly carried out this task. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The purpose of this effort was to construct proposed goals for Negro employment which would be practical, realistic, and just, in order that the downtown employers might be presented with a plan that was both feasible and justifiable. All the facts reported here were taken into account in working this out. In particular, the goals were constructed so that there need never be any question of present employees being discharged to make room for Negro applicants. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> The proposals that emerged are neither racial quotas nor rigid demands. They are negotiable suggestions put forward as proposed first steps toward the ultimate aim of full integration within the downtown work force and equal individual opportunity in downtown employment with regard to race. They were intended to be the principal basis for negotiation with employers&rsquo; representatives. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> These goals became CORE policy when the membership of the Seattle chapter voted to accept them late in July. They were endorsed and agreed to shortly thereafter by representatives of the various organizations that formed the Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown Seattle (DEEDS) in cooperation with CORE. They were first proposed to private and governmental employer groups in a letter, dated 24 July 1964, from the chairman of Seattle CORE and the chairman of the Central Area Committee on Civil Rights representing the combined organizations behind DEEDS. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Proposed Goals </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> The following suggestions were accordingly set forth as initial measures in a continuing effort to abolish job discrimination in the whole downtown area. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="arial10"> That 1,200 Negroes, in addition to those presently working in downtown Seattle, be employed in that area by 1 February 1955. </li>
        <li class="arial10"> That this total of new hires be achieved over a period of six months in states marked by three steps: </li>
        <ul>
          <li class="arial10"> Negroes placed in 300 positions by 1 September 1964 </li>
          <li class="arial10"> Negroes placed in 400 additional jobs by 1 November 1964. </li>
          <li class="arial10"> Negroes hired in 500 more jobs by 1 February 1965. </li>
        </ul>
        <li class="arial10"> That the total of new hires be broken down in six employment categories. </li>
        <ul>
          <li class="arial10"> Office work for private employers; 200 positions. </li>
          <li class="arial10"> Sales and related jobs in retail businesses: 250 positions </li>
          <li class="arial10"> Positions in banks and other financial concerns: 200 jobs. </li>
          <li class="arial10"> Jobs in hotels, restaurants, and entertainment: 100 positions. </li>
          <li class="arial10"> All levels of government employment: 250 posts </li>
          <li class="arial10"> Manufacturing and other categories; 200 jobs. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p class="arial10"> 4. That both in new hires and in promotion of present employees, Negroes receive a larger share of the more desirable positions, using where necessary special measures such as:<br>
  a. Intensive recruiting in the Negro community. </p>
      <p class="arial10"> b. Extensive publicity that applicants of all races are sought. </p>
      <p class="arial10"> c. Explicit instructions to all employment agencies. </p>
      <p class="arial10"> d. Intensive use of the employment services of civil rights groups. </p>
      <p class="arial10"> e. Immediate promotion of present Negro employees to better positions. </p>
      <p class="arial10"> f. Employer-financed programs to increase the skills of both present and prospective Negro workers. </p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="arial10"> Placement of present Negro employees and new hires in contact with the public. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
       
      <p class="arial10"><strong> Negotiations and Action </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"> Meetings and discussion with employers&rsquo; representatives began on 2 August 1964. In the course of the ensuing negotiations many additional suggestions as how these goals might be met were advanced by DEEDS representatives. One other major request was also addressed to the employers: that they carry out a job census. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> This report is not the place for a detailed review of the negotiations. It should be mentioned, however, that spokesmen for the federal government were most cooperative in these discussions. Senior executives of the Seattle Federal Executive Board and the regional division of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, who together are responsible for federal employment policies in the city, complied with our request for a job census and expressed an apparently serious intention to improve the situation for minority employees in federal service rather specifically along the lines suggested. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> At a meeting to which DEEDS representatives were invited, Mayor J.D. Braman presented a few figures on minority employees working for the city and expressed a general intention to hire more minority workers within municipal civil service procedures. Apart from these exceptions, no employer or group of employers has acceded to the request for a job census. Except for the federal representatives, no employer has even agreed to discuss the goals set forth above. During several months of negotiations no other employer advanced any concrete proposal for actually placing Negroes in jobs. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> In mid-October the Seattle Chamber of Commerce opened an &ldquo; Employment Opportunities Center&rdquo; in the Central Area. In spite of repeated request from DEEDS representatives, no concrete job placement goals were stated for the Center, no employer indicated any specific commitment to place qualified Negro applicants, and it was soon made clear that the purpose of the Center was essentially employment counseling rather than actual hiring. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> A ray of hope appeared when the Chamber of Commerce indicted its intention to hold a &ldquo;Jobs Fair&rdquo; on 17 October at which a large number of employers&rsquo; representatives would be present with actual job opening to offer for qualified or trainable Negro applicants. Chamber of Commerce spokesmen told DEEDS representatives that a serious effort would be made to have 200 openings available at this time. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> By this time the CORE membership had grown restless and impatient. However, the membership agreed to postpone direct action in hopes that the &ldquo;Jobs Fair&rdquo; might materialize. This was done in spite of the fact that the number of jobs suggested as a possibility by the Chamber of Commerce fell 100 short of the goal previously requested for a time more than a month and a half earlier. Nevertheless, CORE was willing to wait once more for a show of good faith on the part of the employers. </p>
       
      <p class="arial10"> Then suddenly and without adequate notice of explanation the Chamber of Commerce postponed the &ldquo;Jobs Fair&rdquo; indefinitely. The CORE membership voted for direct action, a general boycott of all downtown businesses was called, and non-violent demonstrations in the downtown area began on the evening of 19 October. </p>
