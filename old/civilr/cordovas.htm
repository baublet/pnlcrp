Fred Cordova was born in California and moved to Washington in 1948 to attend Seattle University, meeting Dorothy soon after. Turning to journalism, they publishe<i>d Bamboo: The Filipino People

		    in American Life </i>while students at Seattle University.
          <p class="style1"> Fred began professional career as a journalist with the <em>Catholic Northwest Progress, </em>later serving as information officer for the University of Washington. In 1957, the couple founded  Filipino Youth Activities (FYA), which over the years brought together hundreds of young people eager to join the award winning FYA drill team.
          <p class="arial10">Active in civil rights efforts throughout the 1960s, in the following decade Dorothy also served as  Director for

          the Demonstration Project for Asian Americans (DPAA), which conducted a wide

              variety of studies on the problems Asian Americans faced in the 1970s.

              In addition,  DPAA recorded an invaluable collection of oral histories that preserve memories for West Coast Asian American communities.. </p>
          <p class="arial10">In 1982, the Cordovas helped organize the <a href="http://www.fanhs-national.org/">Filipino

                American National Historical Society (FANHS)</a>, with Fred serving at the organization's first president. FANHS now has nearly two dozen chapters

          around the United States. In Seattle, it houses the National

          Pinoy Archives (NPA), which is one of the largest collections

          on Filipino American history anywhere. It includes materials on more

          than 9000 individuals and approximately 1500 organizations throughout

          the United States.</p>
          <p class="arial10">Fred Cordova passed away on December 23, 2013 at age 82. </p>
          <p><span class="arial10">Fred and Dorothy Cordova agreed to shared
