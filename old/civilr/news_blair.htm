		Journal </i>was published in Seattle from November 1967 to December 
		1972, and during that time was the most militant weekly newspaper to 
		serve the black community. Supporting the principles of black power, the 
		paper gave space to the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, and 
		other activist groups.&nbsp; The <i>Afro American Journal</i> promoted 
		community self-determination and had strong ties with the Black Culture 
		Center while featuring extensive advertisements from black owned and 
		operated businesses within the Central District. </span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In this report, Doug 
		Blair examines the newspaper’s coverage of school and education issues 
		in 1968 and 1969. Critical of the white-controlled school system and 
		one-sided integration plans, the <i>Afro-American Journal</i> fought to 
		give the black community control over the education of their children.&nbsp;</span></p>

		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The first issue of 
		the <i>Afro American Journal</i>, dubbed “Seattle’s Most Unique Weekly” 
		was published on Thursday November 16, 1967.&nbsp; The paper continued as a 
		weekly periodical until its demise in December of 1971.<i>&nbsp; </i>The<i> 
		Afro American Journal</i> was sold for ten cents and began as a five 
		page Thursday publication (occasionally the paper was issued on a 
		Wednesday due to national holidays).&nbsp; Beginning with their first 
		anniversary of publication, with issue in November 1968, the <i>Afro 
		American Journal</i> expanded to eight pages.&nbsp; This longer format 
		continued for the duration of the <i>Afro American Journal</i>’s run.&nbsp; 
		The paper was edited by E. Loin and Taft Gross, although Taft 
		disappeared from the roster in March of 1968.&nbsp; Very few of the locally 
		produced articles are credited to any author (especially in the earlier 
		issues), which suggests E. Loin or Taft gross were responsible for much 
		of the early writing.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This report 
		considers the paper’s coverage of education during its the first two 
		full years of publication, 1968 and 1969.&nbsp; This time period is 
		especially interesting because it marked a national shift from a black 
		civil rights movement focused on non-violent action to more militant 
		belief in black nationalism.&nbsp; While primarily focused on issues 
		pertinent to the Seattle African American community of the Central 
		District, other stories expanded the scope of the paper.&nbsp; News of the 
		legal struggles of Black Panther leaders and other national black 
		culture interests, for example, were common.&nbsp; The <i>Afro American 
		Journal</i> openly supported the black power movement in the United 
		States.&nbsp; Numerous articles were sharply critical of the white 
		establishment, as well as prominent black politicians and celebrities, 
		who the paper labeled “uncle toms.”&nbsp; Although not overtly militant, the 
		paper offered a forum for the ideas of black nationalism and lent 
		legitimacy to militant leaders of the black power movement.&nbsp; This close 
		affinity to the ideas of black power and self-determination are clearly 
		evident in the paper’s coverage of local education issues and the 
		Seattle Public School system.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The education of 
		black children in the Central District was the most salient theme of the
		<i>Journal</i> over these two years.&nbsp; Prominent headlines in large bold 
		print, such as “Seattle Schools Sick” on July 18, 1968, demonstrated the 
		growing frustration of the community with the Seattle Public Schools 
		neglect of black children.&nbsp; The integration crisis and struggle for more 
		black representation in Seattle’s public schools was certainly a hot 
		issue.&nbsp; During an eight-month stretch starting in April of 1968, there 
		were one to three articles per issue pertaining to the issue of 
		education.&nbsp; Although most of the articles were locally produced, 
		occasionally a national perspective on education of black youth was also 
		provided.&nbsp; The most notable example of this national voice was a weekly 
		syndicated column by Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) national 
		director Floyd McKissick that often related to education during this 
		period.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Leading the <i>
		Journal</i>’s local education coverage was Cliff Hooper, an outspoken 
		member of the Seattle black community and frequent contributor (the only 
		author consistently credited throughout 1968 and 1969) to the <i>Afro 
		American Journal</i>.&nbsp; In the most consistent series of articles in the 
		entire run of the <i>Afro American Journal</i>, Hooper confronted the 
		problems surrounding the education of black youth in Seattle and the 
		United States.&nbsp; His weekly column entitled “Education,” began in the 
		July 11, 1968 issue and continued well into 1970 (although less 
		frequently) with similar themes.&nbsp; Hooper was primarily concerned with 
		whites’ inequitable control of the public school system and Seattle’s 
		lack of black teachers and administrators.&nbsp; Hooper advocated for greater 
		oversight in the education of black youth by the black community.&nbsp; The 
		following selections from the early months of Cliff Hooper’s column 
		contain some strong sentiments, and clearly illustrate his position (as 
		well as the position of the <i>Afro American Journal</i>) on the state 
		of education in Seattle.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“The school officials, 
		well endowed with backgrounds in white mythology, do not seem persuaded 
		that the crime of messing over the minds of our youth is out.&nbsp; As a 
		black administrator on a recent TV program pointed out, “we have grave 
		reasons to be concerned with a system (white education system) that 
		takes our children of normal aptitude and gives them back to us twelve 
		years later unable to read.”” (July 11, 1968: Pg 3)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“Our children must have 
		the umbrella of BLACK AUTHORITY- just as naturally as every white child 
		has WHITE AUTHORITY- as the upward pulling force, like moisture is 
		pulled towards the sun.&nbsp; A BLACK ETHNIC STATUS COORDINATOR must be out 
		into the Seattle Public School System effectively staffed and responsive 
		to the BLACK COMMUNITY.” (July 25, 1968: Pg 3)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“The black community 
		MUST make decisions in the education of its 11,000 sons and daughters at
		<u>every</u> <u>level</u> – staffing, finances, curriculum, physical 
		planning, athletic programs – the whole bit!&nbsp; Any further mistake in 
		educating Black youth must become the privilege of the Black community 
		and the taking of this responsibility must not be further delayed.” 
		(August 1, 1968: Pg 3)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“It must be conceded 
		that generally white people raise white children and black people raise 
		black children, then let it be so.&nbsp; White power is the only power making 
		decisions on the education of Black Youth in the public schools in 
		Seattle and it projects an arrogant image.&nbsp; It presupposes that white 
		people know best.” (August 22, 1968: Pg 5)</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“Barring the miracle 
		that never happens, Seattle’s Black youth will continue to be processed 
		through a system that fails to thoroughly explain where they have been, 
		where they are and where they are going.” (October 24, 1968: Pg 7)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">“Each year of this 
		writers life has strengthened the view that ANY capability that white 
		people may have to educate Black children is not readily apparent.” 
		(October 24, 1968: Pg 7)</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">T</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">he 
		black power movement was especially prevalent at Garfield High School, 
		where Stokely Carmichael had delivered a speech in Spring of 1967.&nbsp; 
		After his attempt to prevent Carmichael from speaking in the school 
		auditorium, Principal Frank Hanawalt came under intense pressure from 
		black militants.&nbsp; Hanawalt eventually resigned from Garfield in January 
		of 1968.&nbsp; Hoping for a black principal, the <i>Afro American Journal</i> 
		was highly critical of Hanawalt’s white replacement, former physical 
		education teacher and vice-principal Frank Fiddler.&nbsp; As the paper 
		editorialized, “It takes bravado for a White principal to come to a 
		Ghetto School and denounce Black Power as Separation” (March 21, 1968: 
		Pg 3).&nbsp; In an effort to regain control over Garfield, Fiddler instituted 
		restrictive policies designed to quell the growing support for black 
		nationalism (March 21, 1968: Pg 1).&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The<i> 
		Afro American Journal</i> also gave front-page coverage to an incident 
		at then predominantly white Rainier Beach High School in September of 
		1968.&nbsp; A group of Black Panthers showed up at Rainier Beach armed with 
		guns (allegedly unloaded) in an effort to protect the small black 
		student body.&nbsp; There had been a series of violent incidents where a 
		number of white students had ganged up on blacks.&nbsp; According to the 
		article, “We can find NOT ONE REPORT on WHITE PARENTS CONCERN for the 
		severely beaten BLACK YOUNGSTER--- only indignation that their children 
		saw BLACK MEN in “their” school (instead of VIET-Nam) with guns” 
		(September 12, 1968: Pg 1).&nbsp; As a result of this and other incidents, on 
		September 23, 1968 the Seattle City Council passed a measure that banned 
		the display of weapons for the purpose of intimidation<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[1]</span></span></a>.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
		struggle for greater black control over central area schools again 
		boiled over in a series of riotous incidents at Washington Jr. High in 
		September of 1968.&nbsp; Again, the <i>Afro American Journal</i> criticized 
		the school’s decision to temporary close the school on September 25th.&nbsp; 
		The paper was attentive to the hypocrisy of the closure, noting that, 
		“that no one was seriously injured in the episodes that led to the 
		closing of Washington Junior High School, but it was a sock in the jaw 
		to the black community… By contrast at Rainier Beach High School, a 
		Black child was brutalized by white people and such extreme action was 
		not taken at Rainier Beach, as serious as a closure” (October 3, 1968: 
		Pg 5).&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
		issue of school integration also received frequent coverage by the <i>
		Afro American Journal</i>.&nbsp; At the center of the integration controversy 
		was a plan that forced central area youth to bus to traditionally white 
		schools in surrounding neighborhoods.&nbsp; As one parent of a Horace Mann 
		Elementary student was quoted, “What it amounts to is that I’m paying 
		for my child to attend a “white” segregated school 20 miles from my home 
		and a school segregated by “Negroes” 150 feet away from my home is being 
		neglected and it’s not fair (February 22, 1968: Pg 1)”.&nbsp; Central area 
		residents did not believe their black children should bear the burden of 
		integration in public schools.&nbsp; One front page column described a 
		disorderly scene when the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle proposed 
		the closure of several traditionally black central area schools, 
		including Horace Mann Elementary, Washington Jr. High, and the reduction 
		of services at Madrona Elementary and Garfield High.&nbsp; A meeting at the 
		East Madison YMCA to unveil the plan became so contentious, the paper 
		reported, it was adjourned prematurely due to fears of unrest and 
		protest (March 7, 1968: Pg 1).</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>
		Afro American Journal</i> entered the mainstream political arena when it 
		advocated the defeat of a school levy slated for the November 1968 
		election.&nbsp; “BLACK PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING to lose and a lot to gain by 
		helping defeat the SCHOOL LEVY on Nov. 5th” (October 17, 1968: Pg 1).&nbsp; 
		According to the paper, the levy would only reinforce the unfair system 
		under which black children took the responsibility and inconvenience for 
		public school integration.&nbsp; The neighborhood school proposal under the 
		levy was to maintain current segregation levels while placing higher 
		priority on schools in white areas of Seattle.&nbsp; With forceful language, 
		the paper argued “THE BLACK CHILD IS THE PAWN in a white racist game of 
		miseducation and sophisticated double talk for which the Black family is 
		ask (sic) to pay for” (October 31, 1968, p1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Afro American 
		Journal</i> offered continued coverage of the newly formed Benjamin 
		Banneker School in the fall of 1969.&nbsp; The Banneker School was run out of 
		the the Black Culture Center (Headed by frequent <i>Afro American 
		Journal</i> contributor Keve Bray) and offered black youth an 
		alternative to the racist public schools.&nbsp; As the newspaper reported, 
		“The curriculum is structured to make Black youth hard working <u>
		productive</u> members of the black community with a goal of obtaining 
		unity and excellence.&nbsp; It was the hope of the school’s organizers that 
		personal sacrifice and dedication would allow the community to confront 
		the public schools and issue a strong challenge to the status quo 
		(October 30, 1969: Pg 1).&nbsp; The Banneker School used the Black Culture 
		Center as a forum for displaying arts and crafts made by students, as 
		well as hosting community feasts and other gatherings.&nbsp; In an effort to 
		promote black community education (as well as a bit of fundraising), the 
		school began producing blackboards for sale in the central area 
		community (November 6, 1969: Pg 6).&nbsp; Although other articles from the <i>
		Afro American Journal</i> in the fall of 1969 still reflected a negative 
		tone in regard to education in Seattle, the Banneker School pieces 
		offered hope for change.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Afro American 
		Journal</i> was a short lived publication during a time of great social 
		turmoil for the black community in Seattle and the United States.&nbsp; The 
		paper offered an Afro-centric perspective, providing stories of 
		prominent blacks around the globe.&nbsp; The paper supported black 
		nationalism and advocated that blacks control their 
		own lives and services.&nbsp;No issue mattered more than education. The 
		<i>Afro American Journal's</i> coverage of the crisis in Seattle’s public schools provide an excellent window 
		into that volatile and complex time.</span></p>
