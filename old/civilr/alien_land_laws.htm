	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.4in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&ldquo;four brothers, all Americans of Japanese ancestry, all honorably discharged veterans of the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team of Japanese American volunteers that has been described as the most decorated unit in American military history for its size and length of service, purchased a plot of land in Southern California on which to build a home for their widowed mother. &hellip; These were the Masaoka brothers, five of whom volunteered for combat service from behind the barbed wire enclosures of government internment camp. &hellip; One brother was killed in action, another 100% disabled, with two others also wounded in action. Between them, the five brothers were awarded some 30 individual decorations and awards. &hellip; And yet, when they purchased this land and presented it to their mother, the State of California escheated, or in more understandable language, took away, this land on the legal grounds that their mother could not own land in that State because she was &hellip; an alien ineligible to citizenship. She could not even receive land in her old age on which to build a home and live out a most useful life with money paid for from the military service of her five sons.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;This speech, which was delivered on numerous occasions across Washington State, pivoted on the dichotomy of Japanese American patriotism, demonstrated by the wartime sacrifice of the five brothers, in the midst of the social and legal exclusion that the alien land law represented for the Japanese American community. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As old as the state itself, alien land laws were enshrined in the Washington State Constitution and later elaborated upon in legislation and pivotal court cases that resonated nationally. Simply stated, these laws prohibited land ownership by residents who were ineligible to citizenship. Despite the fact that their language contained no direct reference to race or ethnicity, the underlying goal of these laws was clearly the disenfranchisement of non-white immigrants. In Washington State, the laws specifically targeted Chinese and Japanese, but they also impacted Native Americans, South Asians, Koreans and many other groups.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper will describe where the alien land laws came from and explore why they were so hard to remove by focusing on four historical periods: the settlement of Washington Territory, the framing of the State Constitution, World War II, and the civil rights period of the 1960s. In each era, white supremacist ideology was employed against various racial groups in order to justify the actions of the elite in business, government, and in war.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> Origins of the Alien Land Laws</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1853 a swath of land was carved out of the Oregon Territory and named Washington Territory. The first territorial governor, Issac A. Stevens, did not waste any time in attempting to create a new frontier for America that could one day vie for statehood. In 1855, he negotiated treaties with Native American tribes in western Washington. Arguably the first &ldquo;land laws&rdquo; in Washington, Stevens&rsquo; primary goal with these treaties was to remove all Native Americans to reservations and make their land available for white settlement.<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> Thus continued a trend in which whites imbibed with a sense of entitlement would strive to dominate the land and cement property rights as a cornerstone of their race privilege.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first alien land law in Washington territory passed in 1864. Contrary to the laws which would later stop Asians and others from owning land, this first law held that any non-citizen <i>could</i> own land &ldquo;in like manner and with like effect as if such an alien were a native citizen of this Territory or of the United States.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a> The object of this law was the peopling of the territory with whites in order to displace Native Americans. With the Indian Wars of the 1850s still fresh on its mind, the territorial government urgently sought to increase white immigration, in the form of homesteading, to consolidate the Territory as white man&rsquo;s land. Accompanying this imperative was the need to accelerate economic growth. At the time, extractive industries such as fishing and forestry dominated the local economy. Capital investment was needed to further these industries as well as develop mining and saw mills which would require very expensive machinery. In addition, money and labor was needed to build the railroads that would link the isolated territory to markets in the rest of the nation. Industry leaders and government officials alike hoped to court foreign investors through liberal alien land laws that favored foreign corporations as well as individuals. Indeed, within ten years the alien land laws expanded to allow aliens, regardless of their residence, to &ldquo;acquire, hold, use and dispose of railroads, tramways and bridges.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a> The laws worked. The Territory&rsquo;s population more than doubled from 11,000 to 23,000 in the 1860s.<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> Washington Territory had gone from &ldquo;nowhere&rdquo; and &ldquo;Indian country&rdquo; to a frontier settlement with white farmers and merchants and cities budding throughout the state.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with growth and progress came new problems and resentments among whites. In his article, the &ldquo;Alien Land Movement of the Late Nineteenth Century,&rdquo; historian Douglas Nelson sums up the feelings of rural farmers and workers during this period nicely:&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&ldquo;In the latter decades of the nineteenth century the Western farmer found himself faced with a multitude of problems, many of which he only half-understood. The railroads which he had enthusiastically helped to build all too frequently turned out to be inconveniently located or prohibitively expensive. &hellip; Even the weather, the final arbiter of his success or failure, proved to be disastrously unpredictable. Underlying and aggravating all these specific complaints was a general and almost uninterrupted trend towards rising costs and falling prices.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The angry farmer could blame the weather, but he could not punish it. Chinese workers, on the other hand, could be punished. It was they and foreign investors that caught the wrath of Washington&rsquo;s frustrated white workers of the late nineteenth century, both in the passing of new prohibitive alien land laws and, for the Chinese, mob violence. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First arriving on the U.S. mainland in significant numbers in 1848, Chinese immigrants were drawn by the California gold rush and soon expanded out to other Western cities.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> In Washington State, mining, salmon canning, and agriculture attracted Chinese workers. As work dwindled between seasons, many came back to Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;China Town.&rdquo; In the spring of 1886 this ethnic enclave was enveloped and destroyed by a mob of disgruntled whites. Perceiving Chinese workers as a threat to their economic interests and generally harboring hatred of differences in culture and appearance, hundreds of whites rioted against the small Chinese population, temporarily displacing the community from the city.<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hatred that ignited the anti-Chinese riot similarly imbued the drive for restrictive alien land laws that would culminate in the racist provisions of the Washington State Constitution. In fact, in the same year as the riot, a new law was passed by the territorial legislature that barred &ldquo;aliens ineligible to citizenship from owning land.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a> It is important to note that while Washington Territory was extremely isolated, its particular brand of white supremacy did not evolve in a vacuum. As early as 1870, anti-Chinese race riots were breaking out in Los Angeles and throughout California. The idea that some aliens were ineligible to citizenship based on their race was commonplace. The Immigration Act of 1790 prohibited Asians from naturalization and in 1875 Congress amended section 2169 of the revised statutes of the United States regarding naturalization to explicitly state that citizenship be available only to &ldquo;aliens [being free white persons,&nbsp; and to aliens] of African nativity and to persons of African decent.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> Thus Asian immigrants were not to become American citizens under any circumstances.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By eschewing the &ldquo;whites only&rdquo; language of the naturalization laws, alien land laws were written in seemingly race neutral terms. The statute that was finally adopted in 1889 as Article Two, Section 33 of the Washington State Constitution read,&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &ldquo;The Ownership of lands by aliens, other than those who in good faith have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, is prohibited in this state, except where acquired by inheritance, under mortgage or in good faith in the ordinary course of justice in the collection of debts; and all conveyances of lands hereafter made to any alien directly, or in trust for such alien shall be void: Provided, That the provisions of this section shall not apply to lands containing valuable deposits of minerals, metals, iron, coal, or fire clay, and the necessary land for mills and machinery to be used in the development thereof and the manufacture of the products therefrom. Every corporation, the majority of capital stock of which is owned by aliens, shall be considered an alien for the purposes of this prohibition.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper classes generally supported the Chinese and defended them during the Seattle riots. They saw the need for laborers on the rails and in the mines and knew that Chinese could often be forced to work for less than whites, driving all wages down. Plus, some upper-class whites had business and personal relationships with the Chinese merchant class in the city, in addition to personal servants with whom they interacted. Working-class organizations like the Populists, Progressives and Knights of Labor, on the other hand, tapped into the resentment of white workers and famers and feverishly propagated the anti-Chinese hysteria and spearheaded campaigns for anti-alien land laws.<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Knights of Labor in particular was responsible for the anti-Chinese riots. Daniel Cronin, a carpenter from California and Knights of Labor organizer, used his ability as an orator to foment the mass hysteria necessary to take the anti-Chinese movement from a group of &ldquo;milling and disorganized Sinophobes&rdquo; to an organized mob. Cronin&rsquo;s Knights of Labor, along with the populists and progressives subscribed to an ideology that historian Carlos Schwantes labels &ldquo;disinheritance.&rdquo; White settlers felt a sense of entitlement, a notion that they should rightfully inherit the riches of the Northwest Territory. But by the late nineteenth century many working-class whites instead saw themselves as disinherited due to the rapid growth of corporate monopolies and the Chinese workers who they saw as unwelcome competition.<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> This ideology, shared by most of the self-proclaimed leadership of the working class, ignored the basic fact that the Washington working class was multiracial and that the true class interests of white workers lie in their defense of non-white workers. Sadly, the call of that century&rsquo;s seminal document of working class empowerment <i>The</i> <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, &ldquo;Workers of the World Unite!&rdquo; was disregarded by the Knights of Labor, who preferred an emotional and alarmist appeal to the fear and racism of their constituencies. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The alien land laws were not promoted with racism alone. The issue of individual land holdings by non-whites was mixed with plebian opposition to foreign land lords and corporate investors. Thus a melded ideology, which romanticized settler, do-it-yourself tenacity and the fantasy of a whites-only, homesteading utopia, linked the two issues. White supremacy also allowed European immigrants to reinvent themselves as privileged American &ldquo;whites&rdquo; by divesting themselves of their national identity, for instance their Irishness or Germanness, and elevated them to a dominant social position.<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a> The popular hatred towards the Chinese that this kind of thinking resulted in led not only to laws prohibiting land ownership but ultimately to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited further Chinese immigration nationally.<a name="_ednref15" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its journey from Territory to State, white supremacy in Washington transitioned from that of a primarily anti-Native American character to a primarily Anti-Chinese character. The impetus of this transference of racist white entitlement was the effective neutralization of Native American interests by the treaty system. Redirection of that energy towards Chinese workers was led by politicians who claimed to represent working class interests. Washington State&rsquo;s early adoption of alien land laws occurred due to an amalgam of the anti-corporation alien land laws that were gaining popularity nationally and the virulent anti-Chinese racism that first gained momentum in California and quickly spread up the West Coast. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Anti-Japanese Racism and the Second Wave of Alien Land Laws</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Chinese Exclusion Act essentially put an end to Chinese immigration for the time being, it did not end employers&rsquo; desire for low wage labor in Washington State. With nearly seamless transition, Japanese immigrants were encouraged to come to the West Coast to work in many of the same industries that Chinese labor once dominated.<a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a> But the racism targeting the Japanese bore a different character, one not just of felt white superiority but also of white jealousy. It was the appearance of Japanese success, in farming and business, which enraged many whites.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In comparison to their Chinese counterparts, Japanese immigrants acted less like sojourners and more like settlers. This pattern occurred for a number of reasons. Prominently among them, Japan was becoming an important economic and military force internationally. The intervention of influential Japanese diplomats helped assure the rights of Japanese living in the United States in a way that the Chinese did not benefit from. For instance, Japanese women were allowed to migrate with their husbands.<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> Immigration by Chinese women had been severely restricted because single males needed less to get by on and could be paid less and forced to move throughout the region in search of seasonal work. Regardless of their ethnicity, all women who emigrated from Asia were treated with disrespect by white society at large and often were regarded as prostitutes.<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japanese men were also employed as migrant laborers in the same industries as earlier Asian immigrants, but many Japanese families were different from earlier ethnic groups because they pursued agricultural labor in order to be able to settle in a community so that their children could attend school and the family could establish community ties with their Japanese neighbors. Getting started as farm laborers, many became farmers themselves, leasing their own plots of land and selling their own crops.<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a> In woodsy western Washington, Japanese involvement on the farm often started in the logging stages.<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a> When no whites would touch the logged land chock full of stumps, Japanese farmers would lease and clear that land to make farms. Subject to the alien land laws that prevented outright ownership, first generation Japanese, known as Issei, got their land by contract, share, or lease.<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a>Later, their American born children would hold land in their names. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japanese in Seattle also formed an ethnic enclave called Nihonmachi where they set up an array of shops and businesses. By 1910 there were 70,000 Japanese and 3,000 Japanese owned businesses in the United States, a ratio of one business for every 22 people. With hotels, restaurants, barber shops, pool rooms, tailors and shoe shops, the Nihonmachi in Seattle represented a self-sustaining economic community.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline"> <a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"> [22]</span></a></span></span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> All this success was met with white hostility, and this time the most vocal leader of the racist exclusion movement was not a member of the working class, but a wealthy publisher named Miller Freeman.<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a> From 1909 until years after World War II, Freeman&rsquo;s numerous publications, including the <i>Town Crier</i> and the <i>Pacific Fisherman</i>, spewed a nearly constant tirade against the &ldquo;unasimilable Japanese.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref24" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a> The largest and most mainstream organization that opposed Japanese land ownership was the America Legion. It used the &ldquo;moral&rdquo; argument that Japanese were taking the jobs of returning soldiers and farming land to which these soldiers were somehow entitled. The heat against Japanese residents in the Northwest sparked into flame during the economic crisis that followed World War I.<a name="_ednref25" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The period from 1914 until 1924 was for Western Washington one of immense social tension and agitation, when many factors came together to affect the outcome of the Alien Land Law issue and the fate of Asians in the state. World War I was the axis around which the world revolved at this time. On the one hand, Japan and the U.S. were allies in the war. This fact had a calming effect on relations between whites and Japanese.<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a> In addition, the Seattle General Strike of 1919 represented the pinnacle of radicalism for organized labor in the region and brought with it a sense of class consciousness that allowed workers to see past the red herring of race hatred that had characterized the movement for so long. Organized Japanese barber shop and restaurant workers went on strike and sent delegates to the General Strike Committee, albeit without voting rights because they were not AFL members. The fact that the Nihonmachi closed during the strike was an act of solidarity that improved race relations in the working-class.<a name="_ednref27" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a> After the strike, in 1920, during U.S. House of Representatives hearings on Japanese immigration, key strike leader E.B. Ault, editor of the <i>Union Record</i>, came out in defense of Japanese residents stating, &ldquo;Personally, I have little patience with the racial prejudice which is attempted to be introduced in the question.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref28" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a></span></p>

In the alien land law section of his dissertation on the Governorship of Lewis Hart, Douglas Pullen describes the social mood in 1919 as one of great fear of foreign influence. Between the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the military advances of imperial Japan the &ldquo;American super patriots&rdquo; had plenty of ammunition to propagate violence towards &ldquo;non-Americans,&rdquo; a group that included &ldquo;Blacks, Jews and other ethnic groups.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref29" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a> </span></p>

The 1919 gubernatorial election was essentially a contest of which politician could convey more enthusiasm in curtailing the rights of Japanese residents.<a name="_ednref30" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[30]</span></span></a> When all this political jockeying turned to criminal attacks on the farmers, the White River Valley Japanese community was one of the hardest hit. A crime wave that included serial robberies of old women and arson attacks which leveled barns and destroyed entire farming operations began in 1919 and continued into the early 1920s.<a name="_ednref31" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[31]</span></span></a></span></p>

The Washington law did not get enough signatures to make it onto the 1920 ballot, but anti-Japanese State Representatives took measures into their own hands and took the bill to the legislature with the following introduction: &ldquo;I have noticed the alarming situation by reason of the foothold that aliens, and especially Japanese, are acquiring our agricultural lands.

Some went from leasing to acting as contract farmers. Others renewed their leases for a maximum amount of time before the law took effect. The most popular tactic, for those who could afford it, was to take the land they had been farming under lease and buy it in their American born (Nisei) children&rsquo;s names.<a name="_ednref35" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[35]</span></span></a> These methods worked for a time but the white supremacist forces that had sponsored the law in the first place were intent on seeing its purpose fulfilled, and in 1923 the state legislature added another law that would close these &ldquo;loopholes.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref36" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[36]</span></span></a> The 1923 law made it so that land put in the name of a child would be considered to be held in trust for the &ldquo;alien.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref37" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></span></a> Thus families had to take the further step of putting the children&rsquo;s land in the trust of a white lawyer. Despite all the maneuvering to keep their land, many families lost it and the overall number of Japanese farms plummeted from 699 in 1920 to less than 250 in 1925. In the long run, however, these laws were not able to permanently remove the farmers. By 1930 the number of Japanese farms was back up to 523 and five times as many were actually owned by Japanese Americans now because so many leasees were forced into buying land for their children.<a name="_ednref38" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[38]</span></span></a></span></p>

In open defiance of the new laws, Terrace declared that he intended to lease some of his land to a Japanese family. He claimed he opposed the alien land law because it &ldquo;illegally revoked some rights of property owners. It prohibited aliens from following common occupations. It violated state and federal constitutions.

This case held national significance because it called into question whether or not the law violated the 1911 &ldquo;most favored nation&rdquo; treaty between the United States and Japan. The fact that the treaty was not considered to override the alien land law bolstered the validity of such laws across the nation and created serious diplomatic tension between the United States and Japan.<a name="_ednref40" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[40]</span></span></a> </span></p>

This case is noteworthy because initially McConigle and the Japanese contract laborers were found guilty of conspiracy to subvert the Alien Land Law. However, shortly after the verdict was reached, juror F. F Merritt told the judge that she had not actually been convinced by the prosecutor and voted with the other jurors under duress.

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, these rays of hope in the state courts were over shadowed by anti-Asian legislation and court cases being decided on the national level. Pivotal to the effectiveness of alien land laws against Asians was the fact that they were not eligible for citizenship based on their race. In 1922 Japanese immigrant Takeo Ozawa fought for his right to citizenship based on the fact that he was in every way a model member of American society. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court where the Court conceded that in most respects Ozawa was an ideal candidate for American citizenship: he spoke English, practiced Christianity, and supported prohibition.&nbsp; However, he was not white, and in 1922 this was what counted most.<a name="_ednref43" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn43"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[43]</span></span></a> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two years later, the Immigration Act of 1924 would end Japanese immigration. This act of Congress prohibited the immigration of virtually all aliens ineligible to citizenship. While not coming out and actually saying &ldquo;No more Japanese,&rdquo; the act was implicitly targeted at the Japanese. Chinese immigration had already been virtually halted in 1882 by the Chinese Exclusion Act and while Koreans, South Asians and others were affected, they were not then major sources of immigration like the Japanese. In fact, the purpose of the law was stated explicitly V.S. McClatchy, publisher of the <i> Sacramento Bee</i> and the leader of California&rsquo;s Anti-Japanese League, in testimony to Congress on the issue:&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1937, another alien land law was passed, buttressing the Washington land laws of the 1920s and providing a grim outlook for Japanese farmers. The definition of &ldquo;Alien&rdquo; was clarified as meaning &ldquo;non-citizens of the United States &hellip; who are ineligible to citizenship by the United States.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref45" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn45"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[45]</span></span></a> This spelled out the fact that the 1924 Immigration Act meant no more Asian immigration, which meant no more land for Asian immigrants already in the United States. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly, the 1937 amendment to the alien land law was struck down in 1941 by the efforts of Filipino activists. In <i>De Cano vs. State of Washington</i>, the court found that the addition of people &ldquo;who are ineligible to citizenship by the United States&rdquo; included Filipinos. Under federal law, Filipinos were not considered &ldquo;Aliens&rdquo; nor were they eligible for naturalization.<a name="_ednref46" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[46]</span></span></a> By the 1940s, tens of thousands of immigrants from the Philippines were living in western Washington. A politically active community, many Filipinos worked in unionized jobs and knew exactly how important it was to fight for their rights. Just as Filipino cannery workers played a leadership role in improving working conditions for all canary workers, the <i>De Cano</i> case played an important role in disabling a portion of the alien land laws for the benefit of all those affected.<a name="_ednref47" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[47]</span></span></a></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The JACL and its supporters decided to sit out the 1964 election, which saw the rejection of &ldquo;Open Housing&rdquo; in Seattle and Tacoma, but returned in 1966 with another Proposed Constitutional Amendment on the ballot. Certainly a lot had changed by 1966. Domestic opposition to the U.S. war in Vietnam had intensified and the Civil Rights Movement had reached its pinnacle in the South and was spreading to the Northern States with increasingly radical rhetoric. This time the voters pamphlet pro-repeal statement took a firm stance that the laws were a serious embarrassment to the state and were having a negative impact on international trade. The first name on the long list of endorsements was that of Boeing Company President William Allen.<a name="_ednref65" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn65"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[65]</span></span></a> For the third time in a row David McMillan was the sole endorser of the &ldquo;against&rdquo; statement. His blurb was mostly unchanged since its original appearance on the 1960 ballot with the exception of a defensive squib that was added:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&ldquo;I do not see how we discriminate against anyone with our Alien Land Law. No issue is raised as to the color or to country of origin to obtain citizenship. The deciding factor in owning land is: Are you or are you not a citizen? National security could be jeopardized with excessive alien land ownership.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref66" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn66"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[66]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear tactics non-withstanding, the repeal movement captured its long awaited victory against the racist alien land laws in 1966. Asian immigrants making their way to Washington State in the new wave of immigration ushered in by the 1965 Immigration Act would no longer have to jump through hoops to own homes or buy land. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Conclusion</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington State, like the rest of the United States, has a vein of white supremacy that has pulsed through its history, puncturing the veneer of democracy and equality in times of crisis. For over seventy years, Washington&rsquo;s alien land laws represented one such branch of white supremacy that dictated who could and could not enjoy these emerald lands based on the color of their skin. In addition, the laws further stigmatized Asians as &ldquo;aliens,&rdquo; a dehumanizing way of looking at people that sets them apart as &ldquo;others.&rdquo; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By facing our region&rsquo;s racist histories with open eyes, we can better see how the effects linger today, in order that next time we are faced with the social challenges of unemployment, inflation and war we do not repeat the pattern of blaming problems endemic to the profit system on the most vulnerable members of society.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, today the specter of anti-immigrant hostility is being faced anew. This time the &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; are mostly Mexican and Mexican American. Looking at the way the United States has repeated history by starting an unjust war in Iraq and how profiteers have driven the economy into the ground with debacle after criminal debacle, such as the Enron scandal, it is not surprising that the nation finds itself mired in brutal, anti-immigrant scapegoating once again. For the duration of Washington State history, immigration and fear of an &ldquo;alien&rdquo; takeover have been used to bolster militarism, like the degradation of Japanese that helped justify U.S. actions during WWII, including the formation of interment camps. Racism has also inhibited working class consciousness and solidarity by turning white workers&rsquo; grievances away from their exploiters and towards other workers of a different race, such as was done to the Chinese during the anti-Chinese riots of 1886. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the economic need for cheap and degraded immigrant labor again in a tug of war with the bigoted frustration of native-born Americans who see their quality of life plummeting, it is time to seriously reckon with the history of white supremacy. Shall we repeat it and re-enact the ritual of passing new anti-immigrant legislation, with the same intended purpose as the alien land laws, or shall we transcend it. A popular chant heard at immigrant defense rallies today rings true, &ldquo;Unemployment and inflation are not caused by immigration! Forget it! Get off it! The enemy is profit!&rdquo;</span></p>
