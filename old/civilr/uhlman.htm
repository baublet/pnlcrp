		  	<p><span class="arial10">Wes Uhlman served as  		Seattle&rsquo;s Mayor from 1969 until 1977, during an  		electrifying period of protest and change. Uhlman  		grew up in Moscow, Idaho and Aberdeen, Washington and described himself  		as &ldquo;basically a small town person.&rdquo;
		  	</span>
		  	<p><span class="arial10">Moving to Seattle to attend college,  		Uhlman was elected  		into the Washington State House of Representatives while still a student  		at Seattle Pacific University. After serving eight years in Washington&rsquo;s House  		and four years in the state Senate he was elected Mayor in 1969. At 34  		years old, he was the youngest Mayor ever elected in Seattle. There was  		little time for celebration. Boeing announced massive layoffs only weeks  		after he took office and Mayor Uhlman was forced to deal with one of  		the most severe economic downturns in Seattle's history. In addition to the  		economic crisis, Mayor Uhlman tried to clean up a notoriously  		corrupt Police Department and bring racial integration to Seattle&rsquo;s City  		Departments. </span>
		  	<p class="arial10">In a video-taped  		interview with Janet Jones and James Gregory on August 25, 2005, Mayor Uhlman  		discussed the challenges of his years in office, with particular attention to his role in a number of important  		moments in Seattle&rsquo;s civil rights history: Seattle&rsquo;s Model City Program,  		its integration campaigns, the  		school bussing controversy, Fort Lawton takeover, and efforts to clean  		up the Police Department. </p>
		  	  <p class="arial10">The highlight of the interview is a long  		description of the moment in early 1970 when federal agents planned a  		raid on the Black Panther Party headquarters. Mayor Uhlman intervened to  		stop the raid, fearing a repeat of the recent assault in Chicago that  		left several Panthers dead. His action brought down the wrath of the  		Nixon administration, but he was sure it was the right thing to do. With  		a police informant inside the Panther organization, city authorities  		felt that there was no need for federal intervention. </p>
