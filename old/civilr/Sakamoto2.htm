	  <p class="arial10">In the fall of 1920, Franklin High School&rsquo;s football   team defeated Broadway High for the first time in the history of the cross-town   rivalry.  Leading Franklin to victory was   a scrappy, 120-pound halfback named James Yoshinori Sakamoto.  Described as an &ldquo;athletic immortal&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</A> in the Seattle area during his high-school years, Sakamoto used a passionate,   fighter&rsquo;s spirit to overcome his slender frame.    A second-generation Japanese-American, Sakamoto would later spearhead   another fight against overwhelming odds.    From 1927 until May of 1942 Sakamoto utilized his eloquence and zeal to   push for the acceptance of Nisei, or American-born Japanese, as full citizens.   In 1928, he founded the <em>Japanese American   Courier</em>, the first English-language newspaper for Japanese Americans. He   also helped launch and lead the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) which   has fought for civil rights for Japanese Americans and other Americans since   1929. Remarkably the former football player and one-time professional boxer was   blind. He had lost his sight before beginning his long career as editor,   publisher, and leader of Seattle&rsquo;s Japanese American   community.</p>
	  <p class="arial10">This essay highlights the efforts of a man wholly   committed to establishing the rights and reputation of Japanese Americans.  James Sakamoto (who preferred Jimmie to   James) displayed initiative and innovation at a time when Japanese Americans   were widely despised and struggled to be recognized as Americans.  The fact that Jimmie Sakamoto left an   indelible mark on this era of Japanese-American history has never been in   question. However, perspectives on his legacy have changed over time.  Immediately following his death in 1955, the   eulogies and biographies were overwhelmingly positive.  Many of the authors were personal   acquaintances of Mr. Sakamoto and had seen firsthand how &ldquo;his fiery tongue and   fighting spirit helped pave the way&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</A> for Japanese-Americans in their quest for acceptance. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">As decades passed and attitudes around civil rights and   methods of social protest evolved, so too did the discussions concerning   Sakamoto.  Mayumi Tsutakawa&rsquo;s Master&rsquo;s   Thesis &ldquo;The Political Conservatism of James Sakamoto&rsquo;s Japanese American   Courier&rdquo; (1976) and Yuji Ichioka&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Study in Dualism: James Yoshinori Sakamoto   and the <em>Japanese American Courier</em>,   1928-1942,&rdquo; (1986) show this change in perception.  Writing from the perspective of a generation   that was contesting the invisibility of Asian Americans and challenging   model-minority stereotypes, they criticized Sakamoto as too moderate and   accommodating. They disliked the fact that Sakamoto and the <em>Courier</em> had counseled against protest   tactics and urged Nisei to Americanize as a way to win acceptance. And they and   others faulted Sakamoto for working too closely with military authorities while   interned at Camp Harmony during World War II.  These criticisms are not invalid but don&rsquo;t   fully take into account the challenges that he and other Nisei faced.  By looking at his life in full we can better   measure the accomplishments of this extraordinary man. </p>
	  <p align="center" class="arial10"><strong> Nisei Boxer </strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10"> On March 22, 1903, James Yoshinori Sakamoto   was born in Seattle, Washington to Osamu and Tsuchi Sakamoto.  Both Osamu and Tsuchi were natives of the   Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan and were part of the &ldquo;Issei,&rdquo; or first generation   of Japanese-born individuals to immigrate away from their native lands.  First settling in Tacoma in 1884, James   Sakamoto&rsquo;s parents found themselves in the belly of a region bubbling with   racial tensions and discrimination aimed at Asian immigrants.  Initially, much of the prejudice had been   directed at the Chinese population, but around the turn of the century the   crosshairs turned towards the Issei Japanese.    While the Chinese were largely viewed as &ldquo;sojourners&rdquo;, only staying long   enough to acquire substantial funding, the Japanese were resented for their   desire to settle and feared for their successful entrepreneurial ability.<A title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Osamu Sakamoto found relative economic success during   this era.  Beginning as a farmhand and   manual laborer in a sawmill in Port Blakely, WA, Osamu eventually opened his own   Japanese restaurant named Kagestsu.  He   would also later become the first Japanese immigrant to own a hotel and a   used-furniture store in Seattle.<A title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</A> While Osamu and Tsuchi Sakamoto did not own   all three businesses concurrently, their entrepreneurial successes earned them   little but enmity from the majority of white Americans in the region, who   resented and tried to curb Asian American enterprises.   From the 1880s until the 1930s, Anti-Alien   Land Laws and Immigration Exclusion Acts undercut the legal rights of Asian   immigrants.  Not only were James   Sakamoto&rsquo;s parents and the rest of the Issei population denied citizenship and   other civil rights, they also experienced a rise of discrimination and racism on   the communal and personal levels. </p>
	  <p class="arial10"> James   Sakamoto&rsquo;s birth at the turn of the 20th Century made him one of the   eldest members of the Nisei generation.    Like many of the other older Nisei, Sakamoto received both American and   Japanese education during his childhood.    However, from an early age Sakamoto displayed a clear preference towards   American education.  A young James   Sakamoto made it very clear where his loyalties as a citizen lay.  In 1920, in the midst of racial tensions on   the West Coast, the United States House of Representatives formed a Committee on   Immigration and Naturalization.  Its   purpose was to revise immigration legislation based off an evaluation of Asian   immigrants in California, Oregon and Washington.  The Committee visited Seattle from July 26,   1920 until August 3, interviewing and acquiring testimonies from various   individuals in the Seattle community.<A title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Marie Sakamoto, James&rsquo; eldest sister, volunteered to   testify.  Jimmie accompanied her and   observed the hearings.  When an   American-born Japanese man scheduled to testify turned up absent, the 17   year-old was suddenly in the spotlight as the only one in the room who could   satisfy the Committee&rsquo;s desire to hear from a male member of the Nisei   generation.  Sakamoto initially refused,   feeling unprepared, but agreed after repeated requests from the Committee   members, saying he &ldquo;could not help but feel it was a challenge.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</A> Asked about his schooling, Sakamoto described   the two methods of education he had received, but indicated a strong gravitation   towards the American way.  When   specifically asked why he had not &ldquo;worked harder to become familiar with the   Japanese language and history,&rdquo; Sakamoto quipped, &ldquo;well, we go to an American   school five hours a day, and we attend the Japanese school for two hours.  That is overwork, two hours, you see, and we   do not get paid for overtime.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</A> All humor aside, Sakamoto later testified to the Committee that he simply   &ldquo;wanted to be American more than Japanese.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</A> Sakamoto     went on to declare himself   willing to enlist in the United States military if it was required of him, and    said that if the Japanese Emperor   attempted to claim the Nisei as his subjects and required their military service   that &ldquo;while it [would] be a difficult one, I [would] get out of it.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</A> The answers provided to the Immigration and   Naturalization Committee illustrated the patriotism Sakamoto exuded from a young   age and elicited positive responses from the representatives. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Spurred on by the wealth of opportunities available to   him as a young and excited American, James Sakamoto travelled to New York City   upon his graduation from Franklin High School &ldquo;with the vague intention of going   to college.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</A> Sakamoto found work as the editor of the   English section of the <em>Japanese-American</em>, a newspaper directed   towards the local Japanese population.    This was Sakamoto&rsquo;s first editorial experience and his first opportunity   to communicate with the Japanese-American community on a larger scale. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">In New York, Sakamoto&rsquo;s love for sports brought him both   fleeting fortune and lasting hardship.  A   regular at local gyms and an experienced judo fighter, Sakamoto&rsquo;s tenacity as an   athlete eventually landed him an opportunity to box professionally in the   lightweight division.  In need of   additional income, Sakamoto took full advantage of his lucky break.<A title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</A> Sakamoto began fighting under aliases in   order to participate in more bouts than allowed for professional boxers in New   York at the time. His ability and competitive nature eventually made Sakamoto   the first Japanese-American boxer to take the ring in historic Madison Square   Garden. He won many of his fight, but the sheer volume of hits Sakamoto endured   during this period would prove to be his undoing.  Only a few years into his brief career,   Sakamoto began suffering from what he described as a &ldquo;cold in his eyes&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</A>,   which was actually found to be the detachment of the retinas from both   eyes. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">This injury resulted in his eventual blindness.  Despite an extreme loss that would render many   dependent and depressed shells of their former selves, James Sakamoto charged   ahead and recorded his most noteworthy achievements while blind.  Rather than brood over his sightless future,   Sakamoto took the initiative.  He   returned to Seattle in 1927 while some sight still remained and began to train   himself to move around his house without vision or aid by donning a blindfold   and learning his daily routine by muscle memory.  Sakamoto also committed scores of telephone   numbers to memory, so his ability to communicate was hardly handicapped when   darkness fully set in.<A title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</A> . </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Bill Hosokawa, a friend of James, described   Sakamoto&rsquo;s perseverance in his 1955 biographical article &ldquo;Blind, But With A   Vision&rdquo;, claiming &ldquo;I noticed he had an odd mannerism of raising his sightless   eyes and looking toward a calendar on the wall whenever he mentioned dates.  I got a weird feeling he could see&hellip;He was so   independent, so sure and natural in his movements that people often forgot he   lived in darkness.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</A> This perseverance in the face of hardship   would become a signature of Sakamoto, and upon his return to Seattle it quickly   proved to be a valuable asset to the Japanese-American   community.</p>
	  <p align="center" class="arial10"><strong>Return to Seattle </strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">In 1927, Seattle reflected the discriminatory practices   and anti-Asian feelings of the era. The Japanese community was widely viewed as   a separate entity from the rest of Seattle&rsquo;s population and perceived as loyal   to the Emperor of Japan.  Even within the   Japanese population, fissures were growing between various groups.  When James Sakamoto asked longtime friend   George Ishihara about the status of the Japanese community, Ishihara detailed   the clash between the two leading Japanese athletic clubs in Seattle, the Taiyos   and Nippons, and how it had divided residents.<A title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</A> Although on the surface it may have seemed to   be a trivial sporting rivalry, Sakamoto saw it as &ldquo;splitting the community   apart&rdquo; because both were demanding the community&rsquo;s financial and emotional support.<A title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</A>   Already discriminated against by the rest of the Seattle population, the   Japanese community was in a precarious position and the situation greatly   distressed Sakamoto. He believed the Japanese residents of Seattle, particularly   the Nisei, needed tube united and become more &ldquo;closely identified with America   as good strong and loyal citizens.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</A> </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Despite the fact that he had just met his bride-to-be, Misao Nishitani, and was   on the verge of beginning a family, Sakamoto was compelled to take action.  Ishihara directed him to the Seattle   Progressive Citizens League (SPCL).    First created in 1921 to combat the Alien Land Laws, the League   experienced little success in blocking anti-Japanese legislation.  By 1927, when Sakamoto contacted President   Shigeru Osawa, the Seattle Progressive Citizens League movement was inactive,   with only three recorded meetings in the previous five years.<A title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</A> With the permission of Osawa, Sakamoto   reorganized the leadership and mission of the Citizens League.  Reputable Japanese-Americans such as Clarence   Arai, the first Japanese-American Attorney in Seattle, and former Citizens   League office-holders George Ishihara and Yuki Higashi headed the revamped   organization.   Meanwhile, Sakamoto   utilized his editorial experience and a vision of Japanese-Americans   assimilation to articulate new goals for the League. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">On January 1, 1928, Jimmie and Misao published the   inaugural edition of the<em> Japanese-American Courier,</em> the first all-English newspaper for   Japanese-Americans.  Sakamoto&rsquo;s   vision and the reformed mission of the Seattle Progressive Citizens League were   made clear in the <em>Courier&rsquo;s</em> debut   edition. His opening editorial stated that the <em>Courier</em> was &ldquo;in a position to   encourage the synthesis of the two cultures&hellip;and in a larger sense, aid in the   closing of the mythical gap between the East and the West.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</A> In later correspondence with Bill Hosokawa,   Sakamoto described articulated a desire to build &ldquo;the character of the second   generation so that we may become loyal and useful citizens who can contribute to   toward the greatness of American life.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</A> The Nisei were at the heart of Sakamoto&rsquo;s   vision of acceptance into American culture.    He saw this &ldquo;rising generation&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</A> as the key to those of Japanese ancestry establishing themselves as respectable   and valued members of American society.    By virtue of birthplace, Nisei were citizens of the United States, unlike   members of the Issei generation who were barred from citizenship.  Sakamoto fully believed that &ldquo;upon the proper   and solid establishment of their spiritual, civic and economic foundation will   be told the true greatness of this [Nisei] generation eventually&hellip;&rdquo; Sakamoto also   argued that the future of Japanese-Americans would &ldquo;&hellip;depend in large measure   upon what we of this generation can accomplish as Americans.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</A></p>
	  <p align="center" class="arial10"><strong>Japanese American Citizenship</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10"> With Sakamoto&rsquo;s   passion and influence pushing them onwards, the <em>Courier </em>and the Seattle Progressive   Citizens League began the Japanese &ldquo;Citizens Movement&rdquo;.<A title="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</A> The   movement sought to display the value of the Nisei as citizens. Sakamoto wrote   that &ldquo;in this way discrimination will start crumbling and harmony can be   attained by the Japanese-American people.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</A> The Progressive Citizen's League was the first of its kind in terms   of advocating for the Americanization of the Nisei and their actions quickly   raised interest up and down the coast.    Japanese-Americans in Oregon and California contacted Sakamoto and the   SPCL President, Clarence Arai, requesting advice and support in creating similar   organizations.  Sensing that the movement   had potential for expansion, Sakamoto and Arai called for a coast-wide   conference in Los Angeles in April 1929.<A title="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</A> Nisei representatives from the three coastal states attended.  A follow-up convention was planned to be held   in Seattle to discuss the creation of a national organization.   In   April 1930, prominent Japanese-Americans from California, Oregon, Washington,   Hawaii, Illinois and New York travelled to Seattle and established the   Japanese-American Citizens League (JACL) with the SPCL&rsquo;s own Clarence Arai as   the first National President.<A title="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</A> Created with the intention of acting as the   political representative for Japanese-American citizens, the JACL made it a   priority to assist their constituents in becoming &ldquo;good strong loyal American   Citizens of Japanese ancestry.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</A> Sakamoto later outlined three main   contributions the League hoped the Nisei would deliver:</p>
	  <p class="indent">&ldquo;1) Make their contribution to the social life of   the nation thru their development as Americans, living with other citizens in a   common community of interest and activity to promote the national welfare.</p>
	  <p class="indent">2) Make   their contribution to the economic welfare of the nation thru their development   as useful and industrious citizens in the agricultural, industrial and   commercial realms of activity.</p>
	  <p class="indent">3) Make   their contribution to the civic welfare of the nation as intelligent voters,   regardless of affiliations and as public-spirited citizens, concerned with the   government and well-being of their country.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10"> Still   highly influential today, the JACL grew into a respected political body whose   loyalty to the United States government never wavered.  Programs and publications such as &ldquo;The Second   Generation Development Program&rdquo; and<em> The   Pacific Citizen</em> were offspring of the JACL, created in order to make the   Nisei politically conscious and active citizens that the rest of the American   society could trust and embrace. </p>
	  <p class="arial10"> &ldquo;Fathered in some considerable part by the vision of the sightless Jimmie   Sakamoto,&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</A> the JACL had the steady support of the editor of the <em>Japanese-American Courier. </em> Years later, Sakamoto reminisced that at the   conclusion of the 1930 Seattle conference &ldquo;nothing could hold back the tears   that welled up as Auld Lang Syne swelled the throats of those gathered&hellip;it was   the beginning of a movement whose rapid growth no one could visualize at the   time.  The seed of Americanism was   already beginning to take root.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The Japanese-American Citizens League continued to grow,   and in 1936 Sakamoto was chosen as the organization&rsquo;s second National   President.  Bill Hosokawa worked as a   journalist on the <em>Courier </em>during this   period and he later wrote that the decision to make Sakamoto President &ldquo;was   acclaimed universally as overdue recognition for nearly a decade of stubborn,   unremitting, unrewarding labor on behalf of the Citizens League movement.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</A> Hosokawa would further elaborate that &ldquo;during   those years it was impossible to distinguish between Jimmie Sakamoto&rsquo;s twin   roles as newspaper publisher and JACL mainspring.  He had founded &lsquo;The Courier&rsquo; as the voice of   the Nisei and in his mind the JACL movement was the Nisei movement.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</A> This description offers insight to the   dedication of Sakamoto and the role he envisioned for his newspaper. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">A weekly publication, Sakamoto&rsquo;s <em>Japanese-American Courier </em>reported that   by 1940 it served Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Japanese community of some 10,000 residents in the   city and vicinity, and [went to] 4,275 readers.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</A> While these numbers indicate success   in distribution, they do not reveal the hardships endured by the Sakamoto   family as Jimmie and Misao struggled to keep the newspaper in business.  Financially, the <em>Courier </em>was never a booming success and   during the first years it experienced some &ldquo;dark days&rdquo; as the Great Depression swept across the country.<A title="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</A>  In the span of two months during 1931, the   Japanese American community in Seattle saw two of its banks close their doors,   taking with them the savings of many residents.    Sakamoto later recounted &ldquo;being penniless but for the 35 cents my wife   had in her purse&rdquo; and seeing his &ldquo;parents savings swept away with the bank.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The <em>Courier</em> was more than a newspaper. Sakamoto formed and supported Courier Leagues&rsquo; for   the youth in the greater Seattle area.    The Leagues provided Japanese-American young people the opportunity to   participate in organized sports such as baseball, softball and football.  In the University of Washington&rsquo;s Special   Collections, dozens of letters from loyal subscribers to the <em>Courier</em> and participants in the Leagues   can be found in James Sakamoto&rsquo;s Papers expressing gratitude and admiration for   the efforts of Sakamoto and his newspaper. This correspondence is an example of   the positive reception Sakamoto received during the pre-war years. </p>
	  <p align="center" class="arial10"><strong>World War II </strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">At the same time Sakamoto was building up his reputation   as &ldquo;an indefatigable fighter for the rights of the Nisei&rdquo; on one side of the Pacific, tensions were rising across the water.<A title="" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</A>  Japan&rsquo;s invasion and occupation of Manchuria   in 1931 and later invasion of China severely strained relations with the United   States.  Negative perceptions of Japanese   people living in America were heightened by these events.  Questions again arose concerning   loyalty.   While James Sakamoto was strongly   pro-American, he had been consistently hesitant to openly condemn Japan&rsquo;s   political tactics.  That changed when   Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor. With the opening line of the <em>Japanese-American Courier&rsquo;s </em>first   edition following the attack on December 7, 1941, Sakamoto completely changed   course:</p>
	  <p class="indent">&ldquo;The dastardly and treacherous attack on the United   States by air and naval forces of Japan last Sunday absolutely absolves the   resident Japanese in this country and their American-born children from any   consideration they may ever have owed to the Japanese Empire&hellip;We are confident we   can say without fear of successful contradiction that this is the sentiment,   almost 100 per cent [of the Japanese-American people].&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</A></span>
	    </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Sakamoto would go on to explain how the people of   Japanese descent in the U.S. had become increasingly less sympathetic towards   the Japanese government over the past few years as their actions became   increasingly militaristic and expansionist.    He also assured that &ldquo;Tokio can count on the open, active, and all-out   opposition&rdquo; of Nisei and Issei, announcing that &ldquo;the die has been cast and the   game will be played to the bitter end until the inevitable result is obtained   and the present Japanese government is beaten to its knees.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</A> Fiery and resolute, Sakamoto&rsquo;s editorial was widely praised by   Japanese-Americans as &ldquo;wonderfully making known our stand in this emergency.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">But the editorial did little to calm the mounting   hysteria among whites on the West Coast as mainstream newspapers fanned fears of   Japanese spies and saboteurs.  As rumors   spread that the government was preparing to round up all persons of Japanese   descent, James Sakamoto worked frantically to prove the loyalty of his   people.  He compiled a massive amount of   documentation illustrating the economic value that the Japanese-American   community of Seattle people had to their city.<A title="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</A> He also travelled with a number of other JACL   leaders to San Francisco to discuss the organization&rsquo;s stance should the   government order evacuation. Sakamoto would later recount to Bill Hosokawa that   &ldquo;while there was sadness in the hearts of everyone there, not a dissenting voice   was raised to fight the [potential] evacuation.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</A> In an odd, twisted way, the JACL   members at this conference agreed that participating without complaint in their   own incarceration would be the ultimate show of loyalty to the American people   and government.  James Sakamoto was in   full agreement with this sentiment and proudly wrote that this &ldquo;was the first   test of their Americanism and we came thru with &lsquo;flying colors&rsquo;.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Two months after Pearl Harbor President Roosevelt issued   Executive Order 9066. By June more   than 110,000 Japanese (more than 70% of them American citizens) had been forced   from their homes into internment camps.<A title="" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</A> In mid-May of 1942, James and Misao Sakamoto,   along with their three daughters Marie, Marcia and Denise were transported to   Puyallup&rsquo;s Camp Harmony with about 7,000 other Japanese-American from Seattle   and Tacoma.<A title="" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44">[44]</A> Much to the dismay of loyal subscribers, The <em>Japanese-American Courier</em> published   its last issue earlier that month.   Many   sent in small donations and messages expressing their gratitude for all that the   Sakamotos had done for their community.    James Sakamoto always replied in the same humble fashion, stating that he   was unsure if he merited the thankfulness of the writer, and that &ldquo;your support   at times like this shames me into feeling for not having done more for the   people at large during normal times.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45">[45]</A> He would also echo the sentiment of the JACL   meeting in San Francisco, insisting that going peacefully to the camps would be   the best way to aid the American war effort.</p>
	  <p class="arial10">In Camp Harmony, James Sakamoto and several other   leading members of the JACL were chosen to be part of a governing board for the   inmates.  This board, named the Evacuee   Administration Headquarters (EAH), served as the middlemen between the Japanese   inmates and the Wartime Civilian Control Administration   (WCCA) and the center manager, J.J. McGovern.<A title="" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46">[46]</A> The EAH also acted as a police force,   enforcing curfews and issuing various rules and strict regulations for the   camps.  While Sakamoto deemed this   relationship with Army camp officials as the best way to show loyalty and   support of the American government, other inmates were not convinced. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Soon, some of these   disgruntled evacuees began to voice their unhappiness with the leadership of   Camp Harmony.  These criticisms led to a   camp-wide vote to determine the confidence in Sakamoto and the other JACL   leaders of the camp.  Although an   overwhelming majority apparently voted in favor of retaining the current   leadership (4,064 out of 5,545 voting)<A title="" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47">[47]</A>,   a substantial number were opposed to the Evacuation Administrative Headquarters   and challenged the validity of the plebiscite.  Kenji Okuda, a young   man incarcerated in Camp Harmony, wrote Norio Higano claiming that the &ldquo;manner   of holding the election was so undemocratic,&rdquo; saying that it was essentially a   &ldquo;Hitler plebiscite in a Japanese Socialist camp set up by a democracy to be run   as a dictatorship.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48">[48]</A> Anger and resentment toward their situation   bubbled up throughout the camp. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">As a camp official and   collaborator with the government, James Sakamoto was the target of much of this   ill will, in stark contrast to the community veneration that he had enjoyed   prior to incarceration.  For Mr. Sakamoto, &ldquo;it was a period of   disillusion.&rdquo; When the residents of Camp Harmony were ordered to move once again   in Fall to Minidoka Relocation   Center in Idaho, Sakamoto decided to get himself out of the awkward position. In   Minidoka he &ldquo;quietly bowed out of camp politics&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49">[49]</A> and slipped into background for   the duration of the incarceration period. Records of his doings at Camp Minidoka   are sparse in comparison to his well-documented days in Camp Harmony. </p>
	  <p align="center" class="arial10"><strong>Quiet Life </strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Nor did he resume   political activism when the internees were released and the Sakamotos returned   to Seattle. Although friends contacted him and Misao and urged the couple to   restart the <em>Courier</em>, they declined.   Jimmie later explained that &ldquo;we never made   any profit out of the Courier, only a bare existence,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowing what capital   it takes and looking over the second generation field, it would have been a   foolhardy attempt to revive the paper.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50">[50]</A> Additionally, Sakamoto removed himself from   active duty in the JACL.  In   correspondence with Bill Hosokawa, Sakamoto claimed he was still in touch with   acquaintances from the days prior the war, and that &ldquo;in past, publicity   was fine for The Courier and the JACL, but now I am just an ordinary individual   or less, and I am enjoying it immensely.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51">[51]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Where once he had occupied the front lines of the   Nisei&rsquo;s fight for acceptance and inclusion, now Sakamoto was content to let   others carry the burden of activism.  He   took a job with St. Vincent   de Paul Salvage Bureau&rsquo;s telephone solicitation campaign after his priest and   close friend Father L.H. Tibesar convinced him in 1955 to accept the   position.  Under Sakamoto&rsquo;s direction the   Salvage Bureau expanded into a successful organization and Sakamoto&rsquo;s superior   was quoted saying &ldquo;I was doubtful as to what a blind man could do in this 3 &frac12;   acre madhouse&hellip;but Jimmie&rsquo;s coming raised the standards of personnel performance   and office practice.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52">[52]</A> This was no surprise to anyone who knew James   Sakamoto.  With three young daughters in   school and a steady income, Sakamoto admitted he was satisfied with the   normalness of his life and did not miss the intensity of being the standard   bearer of the Nisei cause.</p>
	  <p class="arial10">Then in mid-1955, Bill Hosokawa, writer for the <em>Pacific Citizen</em> and longtime friend of   Sakamoto, came calling, hoping to interview the second National President of the   JACL for the 25th Anniversary edition of the organization&rsquo;s   newspaper.   The two exchanged multiple   letters concerning Sakamoto&rsquo;s life which went into great detail about Sakamoto&rsquo;s   many hopes and visions for the Nisei.    The general amicability of the correspondence and Sakamoto&rsquo;s lengthy   answers put on display the kind of good-natured and passionate person that James   Sakamoto still was at this stage in his life. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Mere weeks before the release of Hosokawa&rsquo;s article   however, Jimmie Sakamoto was dead, struck down by an automobile early in the   morning of December 3rd, 1955.    The 25th &ldquo;Silver Jubilee Edition&rdquo; of <em>The Pacific Citizen</em> was turned into a   memorial to Sakamoto, featuring Hosokawa&rsquo;s biographical article and other   remembrances of the famous boxer-turned-editor and his many contributions to the   Japanese-American community. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Despite the criticisms of a later generation of Asian   American activists, who for good reasons had trouble identifying with the   accomodationist tactics that Sakamoto urged, it is impossible not to admire the   courage and dedication of the blind boxer who returned to Seattle in 1927 and   fought quietly and effectively so that Nisei might be recognized as true   American citizens.  &ldquo;A dedicated fighter   for the rights of the underdog, the under-privileged, the unchampioned,&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53">[53]</A> his friend Bob Okasaki eulogized in 1955. It is the   right way to remember Jimmie Sakamoto.</p>
