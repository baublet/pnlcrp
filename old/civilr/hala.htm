	<p class="arial10">Seattle&nbsp;Mayor Ed Murray's <a href="http://murray.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HALA_Report_2015.pdf">Housing  Affordability and Livability Agenda report</a> cites the Seattle Civil Rights  &amp; Labor History Project's research on racially restrictive covenants as the  basis for its claim that &quot;Seattle&rsquo;s zoning has roots in racial and class  exclusion and remains among the largest obstacles to realizing the City's goals  for equity and affordability.&quot; This one sentence has in turn sparked a  public debate in Seattle about whether single family zoning&nbsp;is inherently  racist.<br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>Here is the statement of the Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor  History Project on this matter:</strong><br>
	  <br>
	  First, we applaud the attention to Seattle&rsquo;s history of  segregation and the continuing problem of racial discrimination. Tragically, racism  continues to shape housing opportunities and the composition of neighborhoods  today. By linking the issues of racism and affordability, the report highlights  two of the city&rsquo;s most important challenges.</p>
	<p class="arial10">	  But it would be inappropriate for the Seattle Civil Rights  &amp; Labor History Project to speak for or against the specifics of the HALA  proposals. We are a history project, not policy advocates. We were alarmed to  see a July 21, 2015 article in the <em>Seattle  Times</em> appear under the headline <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/uw-project-reacts-to-mayor-ed-murrays-single-family-zoning-segregation-comments/">&rdquo;UW reacts to mayor&rsquo;s single-family zoning,  segregation comments.&rdquo;</a> We would never pretend to represent the views of  University of Washington. Moreover, we had carefully stayed out of the media  controversy surrounding HALA, with the exception of a short clarifying <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152891801027035&id=126908547034">statement  posted on our Facebook page</a>. The reporter used one sentence of that  statement and used it in a misleading way that seemed to suggest that we  opposed the HALA report. That is incorrect.</p>
	<p class="arial10">	  Secondly, in the interest of historical accuracy we offer a  couple of clarifying points.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="arial10">While the report was technically wrong in  referring to &ldquo;zoning based on race,&rdquo; the distinction is pretty academic.&nbsp; Unlike some cities, Seattle never enacted segregation  zoning ordinances. This was probably a matter of timing. Racial zoning was  disallowed by the US Supreme Court in 1917, just a few years after cities began  experimenting with any kind of zoning laws. Segregationists then turned to deed  restrictions, restrictive covenants, and campaigns of intimidation to keep African  Americans, Asian Americans, and other designated populations out of &ldquo;white  neighborhoods.&rdquo; These were the tactics that became common in Seattle and as we  document with our <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants.htm">database  of 416 restrictive covenants</a>, they shaped patterns of segregation that  lasted through much of the 20th century. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="arial10">Homeownership is not the issue. Rental markets  have been and continue to be twisted by racism. In days past, racially  restrictive covenants placed in property deeds applied to rentals and home  ownership alike. So did realtors' racist practices. So did bankers' redlining  practices. They were not specific to single family zoned spaces&mdash; they covered  nearly all residential housing in the region. Moreover, as the <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/13-rental-properties-in-seattle-accused-of-discrimination/">Seattle  Office of Civil Rights has demonstrated</a> in repeated investigations, racial  discrimination remains a serious problem in the rental market. Many apartment  building managers have been caught violating federal and local  anti-discrimination laws, turning away or overcharging Black, Latino, Asian  (and LGBTQ) prospective tenants.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li class="arial10">Finally, it is instructive that even at the  height of segregation, much of the Central District was zoned for single family  residences. While denied access to other neighborhoods by the rigid rules of  segregation, some African Americans and Asian Americans were able to purchase  homes, albeit at artificially inflated prices. According to Quintard Taylor's classic  study,&nbsp; <em>The Forging of a Black Community</em>, Seattle's Central District had higher  African American homeownership rates than most cities before the 1980s. And the  dream of homeownership fueled campaigns for &ldquo;Fair Housing,&rdquo; the decades-long  struggle to ban housing discrimination and open all neighborhoods to all  peoples. </li>
