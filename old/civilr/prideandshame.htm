	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the summer of 1970, the Seattle chapter of the Japanese 
	American Citizens League (JACL) organized a revolutionary museum exhibit and 
	showcased it at Seattle’s&nbsp; Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) for a 
	three month period.&nbsp; The exhibit was titled “Pride and Shame,” and 
	chronicled the history of the Japanese and Japanese Americans in the Pacific 
	Northwest from the late 1800s to the present, 1970.&nbsp; Though museum staff 
	expected the exhibit to be a community celebration, a significant part of 
	the exhibit focused instead on the Japanese internment experience during 
	World War Two.&nbsp; “Pride and Shame” helped the public and younger Japanese 
	Americans learn what internment was like and witness the full extent of its 
	effects after years of silence.&nbsp; The exhibit had lasting effects on those 
	who saw it, and millions of others who did not see it.&nbsp; This essay tells the 
	story of how “Pride and Shame” helped change public opinion about the 
	Japanese American experience in World War Two.&nbsp; The exhibit was displayed at 
	a pivotal time in American history, following on the heels of major gains by 
	the civil rights movement.&nbsp; The resulting community into which “Pride and 
	Shame” was showcased provided for a receptive and thoughtful reaction. By 
	questioning internment, the exhibit prompted scholars and non-scholars alike 
	to revisit the issue and take seriously the need for reparations.&nbsp; The 
	ensuing Japanese American redress movement of the 1970s traces its roots to 
	the “Pride and Shame” exhibit. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigating “Pride and Shame” was a complicated, yet 
	fulfilling undertaking.&nbsp; Information about the museum exhibit is scant, 
	difficult to interpret, and, at times, incomplete.&nbsp; The main points of 
	reference about “Pride and Shame” come from two sets of papers at the 
	University of Washington Libraries Special Collections: The&nbsp; Donald Kazama 
	Papers and the Seattle JACL Papers.&nbsp; Wading through the stacks of artifacts, 
	notes, and miscellaneous papers was tedious but informative and rewarding. 
	Robert Shimabukuro’s book, <i>Born in Seattle: The Campaign for American 
	Redress</i>, proved to be a valuable secondary source of information about 
	Seattle’s Japanese community and its influential role in the movement for 
	redress.&nbsp; Shimabukuro considers the “Pride and Shame” exhibit, and argues 
	that it was a vital factor in getting Japanese Americans to seek political 
	and economic redress for internment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Pride and Shame 
	exhibit did not emerge out of thin air.&nbsp; It came out of years of pent up 
	emotion in the Japanese American community.&nbsp; It came from a real event that 
	affected thousands of Japanese and non-Japanese people in very different 
	ways.&nbsp; Before the particulars of the exhibit are discussed, it is important 
	to set up the need from which the exhibit originated and the context within 
	which it was created.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">History:&nbsp; The Japanese 
	American Internment Experience</span></u></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">When Pearl Harbor was 
	bombed by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, Japanese citizens and aliens 
	within the United States were just as shocked as the non-Japanese. Many 
	Japanese-Americans living in the United States were American citizens. The 
	bombing was just as much an attack on Japanese living in the United States 
	as it was on the general public.&nbsp; Even though those of Japanese descent were 
	equally attacked in the bombing, they endured a much different fate than the 
	general public.&nbsp; In the atmosphere of wartime hysteria, President Franklin 
	Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942.&nbsp; This 
	presidential decree announced that those of Japanese descent presented a 
	severe threat to the security of the United States. This threat was 
	considered so great that the decision was made to relocate Japanese and 
	Japanese Americans to the interior of the United States to internment 
	camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite protection of the writ of habeas corpus and the pursuit of 
	life, liberty, and property under the Constitution, both of these safeguards 
	were denied by the Executive Order 9066.<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Over 110,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans were uprooted from their homes 
	along the West coast and forced to move into the interment camps.&nbsp; Because 
	the Japanese were not given much notice about their evacuation, many lost 
	their homes, businesses, and possessions.&nbsp; The Commission on Wartime 
	Relocation and Internment of Civilians estimates that the total property 
	lost was $1.3 billion, and net income lost was $2.7 billion (calculated in 
	1983 dollars).<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	More damaging to the Japanese community was the loss of personal liberty and 
	dignity.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Ten interment camps were 
	established in remote areas of the United States.&nbsp; They included:&nbsp; Heart 
	Mountain in Wyoming, Tule Lake and Manzanar in California, Topaz in Utah, 
	Poston and Gila River in Arizona, Granada in Colorado, Minidoka in Idaho, 
	and Jerome and Rowher in Arkansas.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	These places were to house Japanese and Japanese Americans for more than 
	four years, but they never were to become home.&nbsp; Families were crammed into 
	small barracks, surrounded by barbed-wire fences and armed guard towers.&nbsp;	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The internment camps 
	were cleared of their prisoners in early 1945 and many Japanese and Japanese 
	Americans returned to their homes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was not much to 
	return to;&nbsp; the Japanese communities that had once thrived in the United 
	States had been destroyed by four years in internment camps.&nbsp; They set to 
	work to regain what had been lost during internment, but the path to success 
	and acceptance was rough for all and unattainable for some.&nbsp; The distrust 
	and betrayal of the United States had a lasting effect on the Japanese 
	community.&nbsp; Feelings of shame, resentment, sadness, and confusion plagued 
	many Japanese and Japanese Americans.&nbsp; These feelings were dealt with in 
	varying ways:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people tried to forget what had happened to them, many 
	lived in shame and bitterness, and some even thought that internment had 
	been for their best and perhaps was deserved.&nbsp; As Larry Matsuda, an educator 
	and activist born in Minidoka internment camp, recently pondered: </span>	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">What can you do if the 
	government—your government—turns against you?&nbsp; You are a citizen and they 
	put you in jail overnight and you are then an outlaw.&nbsp; Would you want to 
	talk about that afterwards?&nbsp; No, it’s something you want to forget, move on 
	past.<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">And 
	yet, not everyone was willing to forget and move on from their internment 
	experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Japanese Americans fought for acknowledgment and justice 
	for what had happened to the Japanese in the United States.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although over 110,000 
	people had been removed from their homes, many among the general public were 
	unaware of the extent to which the Japanese and Japanese American suffered 
	during World War Two.&nbsp; The ignorance and prejudice of most Americans 
	regarding the internment insulted and alarmed those who were victimized by 
	it.&nbsp; Furthermore, many of the younger Japanese Americans were not fully 
	aware of what their elders had endured.&nbsp; The desire to inform these two 
	unknowledgeable groups coincided with a growing but understated desire to 
	seek retribution from the government for the injustices inflicted upon the 
	Japanese.&nbsp; As that need became more strongly felt in the Japanese American 
	community, it was clear that awareness about the internment experience would 
	have to be raised among the public.&nbsp; The Asian youth movement of the late 
	1960s was part of this awareness raising.<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	So was the national campaign, from 1967 to 1971, to repeal Title II of the 
	McCarran Act on the grounds that it could be used to rationalize another 
	round of internment of American “subversives.”<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In Seattle, the first major attempt to revisit the issue of Japanese 
	internment occurred in the summer of 1970 through the creation of the “Pride 
	and Shame” exhibit.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Planning for 
	Story-Telling:&nbsp; Creating a Museum Exhibit</span></u></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The planning and 
	implementation of “Pride and Shame” resulted from the Japanese American 
	Citizens League (JACL) efforts in Seattle.&nbsp; This national civil rights group 
	had been created in 1929 in California to promote Japanese Americans’ 
	rights, taking its inspiration in part from the Seattle Progressive Citizens 
	League.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	After World War Two, the group actively sought aid from the government for 
	”resettlement” after internment, a form of redress.&nbsp; Although these efforts 
	were met with some action by the government, it was not considered adequate 
	by JACL activists. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In early 1970, Seattle’s 
	Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) asked the Seattle JACL to put 
	together an exhibit to coincide with the 1970 Expo in Osaka.<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	MOHAI asked that the exhibit display the history of Japanese Americans in 
	the Pacific Northwest, with a focus on the JACL.&nbsp; The JACL accepted the 
	offer, but ended up bringing a different agenda to the exhibit than MOHAI 
	had expected.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.75in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Tomio Moriguchi, owner 
	of Seattle’s prominent Uwajimaya grocery store, was the President of the 
	Seattle JACL chapter at the time.&nbsp; He helped turn the exhibit space provided 
	to the JACL by MOHAI into an opportunity to do more than display cultural 
	aspects of the Japanese and Japanese Americans in the Northwest.&nbsp; When he 
	created and co-chaired the JACL’s exhibit Committee, he inadvertently put 
	together a Committee that included community activists who wanted to put 
	particular emphasis on the incarceration of the Japanese during World War 
	Two. Minoru Masuda co-chaired the Committee with Moriguchi, and Committee 
	members included Harold Kawaguchi, Donald Kazama, Larry Matsuda, James 
	Morishima, Elaine Nakai, June Shimokawa, Calvin Tokagi, Ben Yorito, Barbara 
	Yoshida, and Fran Wada.<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Quickly, then, the MOHAI 
	exhibit expanded to incorporate booths from community groups throughout the 
	city, and shifted its focus to include political as well as social topics.&nbsp; 
	Initial support for the shift was gauged by a letter dated April 3, 1970, in 
	which the Seattle JACL described the possible museum exhibit and called for 
	support from within the Japanese community.&nbsp; “The topic for consideration 
	will be Japanese culture, art and history as it relates to the third 
	generation citizens….Your comments and ideas as well as assistance will be 
	needed to make a worthy display.”<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Japanese organizations that responded and aided in the creation of the 
	exhibit included multiple Japanese churches; the Nisei Veteran’s Committee; 
	the Japanese Consulate General of Seattle; Asian Coalition for Equality 
	(ACE); the Japanese Cultural Festival, Inc.; the Rokka Ski Club; and Boy 
	Scout Troop #53.<a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a> 
	&nbsp;Moriguchi described the positive response as an event taking place at a 
	fitting moment.&nbsp; “Maybe the timing was right.&nbsp; It gave people an opportunity 
	to release some pent-up emotions, feelings that were bottled up.”<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	With a budget of $600, such backing was essential.<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The JACL received support from these organizations through the donation of 
	photographs, personal testimonies, help in organizing the display, and 
	advertisement of the exhibit.&nbsp; Work on the exhibit brought people of various 
	organizations and of widely varying ages together to work towards a common 
	goal for the first time.&nbsp; This overwhelming show of support and fraternity 
	encouraged all involved, and allowed the JACL to move along in the planning 
	stages excitedly.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Less than one month 
	later, on May 1, 1970, the JACL sent out invitations for the exhibit.<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The invitation provided the exhibit’s specifics and informed readers about 
	its objective.&nbsp; The invitation said the exhibit’s purpose was “To show the 
	general public, and particularly the younger Japanese people, the history to 
	date of the Japanese people in the United States.”&nbsp; The invitation further 
	described the exhibit’s purpose as displaying “the history of the Japanese 
	relocation camps and anti-Japanese agitation, biographies of well-known 
	local Japanese, the history of established Japanese organizations, and the 
	history of early Japanese occupations.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">
	[15]</span></a></span></span>&nbsp; While the invitation described the 
	educational goals of the exhibit, the Seattle JACL hoped that much more 
	would be learned from the display.&nbsp; In an informational book about the 
	exhibit, the JACL wrote, “this public program is submitted with the hope 
	that it will bring unity to a divided society, understanding of the nature 
	of diversity in a pluralistic culture, and the recognition of the dignity of 
	all groups.”<a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Approaching the presentation of the exhibit with high expectations for 
	public revelation and approval, the JACL continued to collect archives and 
	refine the exhibit layout.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><u>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">What’s In A Name?</span></u></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">An important aspect to 
	the exhibit was the creation of a strong and compelling title.&nbsp; Larry 
	Matsuda, the first teacher to introduce Asian American history into 
	Washington State’s schools, and the youngest member of the Pride and Shame 
	Committee, came up with the name “Pride and Shame” at one of the Committee 
	meetings.&nbsp; Taken from a Walter Cronkite special called “The Nisei: The Pride 
	and the Shame,” Matsuda adapted it to “Pride and Shame.”&nbsp; He went on to 
	explain to the committee members the suitability of the title, relating the 
	pride in the achievements of the Japanese Americans and the shame from the 
	injustice of being interned.<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	A report written after the exhibit was shown described the two opposing 
	words of the title:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">‘Pride’ refers to the 
	proudness and spirit of an immigrant race who came to these alien shores to 
	seek its fortunes.&nbsp; ‘Pride’ refers to their accomplishments as pioneers in a 
	young and growing west….‘Pride’ means their families and their children, the 
	second generation Nisei, marginal, trying to bridge the gap with one foot in 
	the Japanese community and the other in an unfriendly, dominant society, 
	striving to fulfill the dreams of achievement.&nbsp; ‘Pride’ means the Sansei, 
	the third generation, seeking to establish their identity, working to 
	redress the inequities of society in their own different way.<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;To 
	complete the Japanese American story, however, it was essential to include 
	and acknowledge the shame of being discriminated against, interned, and 
	betrayed by the American government.&nbsp; The report further described:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">‘Shame’ means the 
	history of prejudice and discrimination that white society has long 
	inflicted on minorities…’shame’ means the explosion of fear, hysteria, and 
	racism that resulted in the forced wartime evacuation of over 110,000 
	Japanese, two thirds of them American citizens, from their homes on the west 
	coast to 10 concentration camps in the interior.&nbsp; As the Nikkei people now 
	seek to eradicate inequities that exist in all fields of endeavor for all 
	minorities, it is the ‘shame’ of American society that such inequities 
	exist.’<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;The title “Pride and Shame” reflected approximately 100 years of Japanese 
	history in the United States, supporting the exhibit’s wide range of 
	topics.&nbsp; The committee accepted the title for the exhibit and continued 
	advertising the exhibit. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><b><u>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The subjects for the 
	exhibit were given much consideration by the JACL committee and Japanese 
	American contributors.&nbsp; After deliberating on multiple topics and methods of 
	presentation, the committee decided on seven issues within the Japanese 
	American community’s past and present:&nbsp; the Issei Pioneer, The Japanese 
	American Community, World War Two and Evacuation, Concentration Camps—USA, 
	Proof In Blood, Sansei Looks at Today, and The Challenge.&nbsp; Included within 
	the framework of these overarching themes were details of early occupations 
	of the Japanese, Japanese American organizations and activities, well-known, 
	local Japanese American personalities, and the Japanese American World War 
	Two experience.&nbsp; These subjects were displayed through the use of 
	photographic essays, scale models, and cultural objects along multiple 
	panels.<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The style in which the subjects were displayed created a mood of sharing—and 
	rightfully so, since the goal of the exhibit was to share the Japanese

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The internment 
	experience did not dominate the exhibit, even if it is what the Pride and 
	Shame would be most remembered for.&nbsp; The pride of the Japanese for their 
	community, heritage, and perseverance was well documented in the exhibit.&nbsp; 
	Numerous pictures featured Japanese from different eras engaging in cultural 
	and American activities.&nbsp; A female mannequin displayed the traditional dress 
	of a Japanese woman, while pictures on the panel behind her showed Japanese 
	men and women in American attire.&nbsp; Other panels showed the various Japanese 
	religious institutions.&nbsp; The Buddhist Church received three panels and 
	exhibited pictures of the church, a picture collage of Japanese youth, and 
	information about Buddhism.&nbsp; Another three panels were dedicated to the 
	Blaine Memorial United Methodist and the Japanese Congregational Church. 
	Photographs were the main medium used to convey information, showing people, 
	the church structures, and portraits of various pastors.&nbsp; Multiple panels 
	chronicled the early occupations of Japanese settlers through pictures, 
	including railroading, lumbering, fisheries and canneries, farming, and 
	hotel work.&nbsp; A scale model on display portrayed Japanese men working on the 
	construction of railroad tracks.&nbsp; Finally, several panels spoke to the 
	Sansei, the third generation of Japanese in the United States, describing 
	current events and activities within the community.<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	All of these subjects highlighted the positive history of the present 
	situation of the Japanese American community and individuals.&nbsp; The 
	accomplishments of the Japanese Americans on display depicted and kindled 
	pride within the community.&nbsp; The inclusion of these positive aspects of the 
	Japanese American experience was vital to the exhibit. Because the “Pride 
	and Shame” exhibit was the first of its kind to display the injustices 
	inflicted upon the Japanese Americans during World War Two, it was sure to 
	meet unreceptive and unwilling audiences.&nbsp; The pleasant feelings evoked from 
	the “pride” displays would be beneficial to viewers when observing those 
	parts of the exhibit dedicated to the “shame” of America’s wartime policies.	</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Three panels were 
	dedicated to the incarceration experience of the Japanese and Japanese 
	Americans;&nbsp; the title was made of newspaper headlines and spelled out “JAPS.”&nbsp; 
	One panel presented the notices and public proclamations of the Japanese 
	evacuation.&nbsp; It also showed examples of yellow peril propaganda.&nbsp; In bold 
	letters and in the middle of this panel, a quote from Supreme Court Justice 
	Murphy describing the injustice of internment was placed:&nbsp; “One of the most 
	sweeping and complete deprivations of constitutional rights in the history 
	of this nation in the absence of martial law.”&nbsp; One of the fears about 
	displaying the internment history was a revival of Japanese discrimination.<a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This quote reminded viewers that what had happened was indeed an injustice.&nbsp; 
	A second panel showed pictures of the evacuation process.&nbsp; The photographs 
	displayed groups of Japanese leaving their homes, boarding trains to the 
	internment camps, waiting with luggage, and other images of relocation.&nbsp; 
	Other pictures portrayed the barracks and the camps, highlighting the 
	desolate and inadequate living conditions in which the Japanese were forced 
	to subsist.&nbsp; The third panel in the series showed more images of camp life.&nbsp; 
	A map of the United States illustrated where the ten internment camps were 
	located, and an aerial shot of one camp provided viewers with an idea of the 
	camp structure.&nbsp; A picture of a guard tower reminded viewers that the 
	Japanese had not been relocated into normal housing conditions, but rather 
	to heavily secured barracks.&nbsp; The photo of a lonely, dusty, and ugly street 
	displayed a typical camp scene.<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	These panels displayed the shame that the Japanese community felt towards 
	their experience and also showed the shame of the government for forcing the 
	evacuation of thousands of innocent people.&nbsp; The internment experience was 
	further depicted through a full-scale model of the interior of a barrack.&nbsp; 
	The set showed the cramped living quarters and the lack of privacy that a 
	barrack provided.&nbsp; Included in the model were a twin bed, a table and three 
	chairs, a dresser, a desk, and a wood-burning stove.&nbsp; The “room” appeared 
	clean and attempted a homey atmosphere, but was obviously extremely small 
	and inappropriate for a family.&nbsp; This life-size model gave many viewers 
	their first glimpse at the living conditions in which Japanese lived during 
	World War Two.&nbsp; These panels and displays depicting “shame” evoked various 
	emotions and responses from the viewers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not all of the 
	reactions were sensitive to the Japanese experience.</span></p>

	The public also became informed of the exhibit through media coverage, 
	albeit scant.&nbsp; Both <i>The Seattle Times</i> and <i>The Seattle

	Although targeted to Japanese Americans, the newspaper did not significantly 
	highlight the profound museum exhibit or relate its importance to its 
	readers.&nbsp; Given the large number of people who viewed the “Pride and Shame” 
	exhibit, it is surprising that so little attention was paid to it by the

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Many of those who viewed 
	the “Pride and Shame” were of Japanese descent.&nbsp; It is hard to know how the 
	Japanese American community as a whole felt about the exhibit.&nbsp; Many had 
	spoken openly about internment while others had long been silent, and 
	reactions to the exhibit likely varied.&nbsp; An interview with Matsuda in 
	November 2005 provides some insight into the complicated reactions of 
	Japanese Americans to internment.&nbsp; On the one hand, Matsuda noted that his 
	parents spoke openly about internment, and actually participated in reunions 
	with people they met while interned.&nbsp; But on the other hand, Matsuda noted, 
	“Japanese are not like Italians…there’s a lot of keeping it inside, not 
	expressing things…you don’t say anything, you don’t complain, you don’t make 
	waves.”<a name="_ednref32" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[32]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

	The exhibit caused enough Japanese Americans to evaluate their feelings

	may not have attracted the attention of the media, it did get the attention 
	of several other museums and Japanese communities in other parts of the 
	Northwest.&nbsp; Kenneth Hopkins, director of the Washington State Capitol Museum 
	asked Tomio Moriguchi if he would be interested in creating a “joint 
	museum-community project” out of&nbsp; “Pride and Shame.”<a name="_ednref34" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[34]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Moriguchi and the Seattle JACL decided to continue the “Pride and Shame” 
	project and take the display on the road.&nbsp; Moriguchi turned things over to 
	Dr. Minoru Masuda, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington 
	and co-Chair of the Pride and Shame Committee, because of his knowledge of 
	attaining grants.<a name="_ednref35" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[35]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In mid-October, Minoru sent a hefty report to the National Endowment for the 
	Humanities in request of a grant totaling $8571.00, to be used from July 1st 
	1971 to December 31st 1973.<a name="_ednref36" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[36]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The application provided a brief history of the Japanese American community 
	and emphasized the need to tell the story of internment to more people.&nbsp; The 
	application further explained the breakdown of the traveling exhibit, 
	listing how it would travel, where to, and what would be included in the 
	exhibit.&nbsp; The grant application was reviewed and in late March 1971 earned the JACL just over $6500.00 to put “Pride and Shame” on the road.<a name="_ednref37" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></span></a>&nbsp;	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A new committee was

	Much of the same material and information was included in the traveling 
	exhibit, but showcased in a new way.&nbsp; Members worked to revise the display;&nbsp;

	put up and taken down.&nbsp; Furthermore, the committee decided to enhance the

	Japanese community would share stories, lead discussions, and answer 
	questions. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Like the naming of the 
	original exhibit, the quest for the exhibit logo produced an informative, 
	artistic, and crucial graphic design.&nbsp; Frank Fujii designed what is still

	and Mercer Island high schools.&nbsp; The Seattle JACL and Japanese American 
	communities throughout the Pacific Northwest felt that the “Pride and Shame” 
	exhibit was so important that they applied for and were granted an extension 
	of funding for additional years of travel.&nbsp; This extension allowed even more 
	people to view the Japanese American history and culture. The last showing 
	of the exhibit was in 1975 at Western Washington University.&nbsp; Despite the

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The traveling exhibit 
	was largely successful.&nbsp; Once again, however, media attention was scarce, 
	and few reactions to the exhibit were recorded.&nbsp; Why was there so little 
	reporting on the “Pride and the Shame” exhibit?&nbsp; It is difficult to 
	determine all of the factors that went into the reception of the exhibit by 
	the public and the media.&nbsp; The fact that there is little information about 
	the “Pride and Shame” exhibit and its response by the public does not leave 
	us empty-handed.&nbsp; Rather, the lack of information is in itself information.&nbsp; 
	Perhaps the public was not prepared to openly acknowledge a crime committed 
	against some of its inhabitants under the watch of everyone. Another factor 
	that played into how the exhibit was received was the relative novelty at 
	the time of a political museum exhibit that questioned the American 
	government’s handling of World War II.&nbsp; Especially at MOHAI, exhibits mostly 
	displayed “pretty” history and cultural artifacts.&nbsp; For example, exhibits 
	showcased at MOHAI between its founding in 1952 and “Pride and Shame” 
	include:&nbsp; “Christmas Around the World,” “Boeing History,” “Early Day 
	Outdoors,” and “Towboating.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:

	[44]</span></a></span></span>&nbsp; The lack of provocative exhibits provided for 
	a mismatched atmosphere in which “Pride and Shame” entered.&nbsp; As one of the 
	first museum displays to feature injustices at MOHAI, “Pride and Shame” 
	might have taken some by surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although media coverage 
	is rapid and has far-reaching powers, there are other benchmarks from which 
	we can measure the success of “Pride and Shame.”&nbsp; One such point of 
	reference is literature.&nbsp; From scholarly articles to personal testimonies, 
	literature concerning the Japanese internment began to be published in huge 
	numbers.&nbsp; A search through various databases proves that before 1970, the 
	year in which “Pride and Shame” was exhibited, journalism about Japanese 
	internment was scarce.&nbsp; According the University of Washington Libraries 
	Database, a total of about 19 books about Japanese internment was published 
	between 1940 and 1969.<a name="_ednref45" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn45"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[45]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The search returned ten books published from 1940 to 1949, six books from 
	1950 to 1959, and three books from 1960 to 1969.&nbsp; The growing demand for 
	redress during the 1970s and 80s was met with the publication of countless 
	books, articles, and journals, as well as the production of videos and sound 
	recordings.&nbsp; The new texts focused more specifically on the injustice of the 
	internment experience, effects of internment on the Japanese American 
	population, and the need for reparations.&nbsp; From 1970 to 1980, 19 books were 
	published, and from 1980 to 1990, 43 books about internment were published.&nbsp; 
	A search of the OCLC WorldCat database, an international literature search 
	engine, reports that 54 books hit the shelves between 1980 and 1990, while 
	20 sound recordings were created.<a name="_ednref46" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[46]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The titles sported by the new literature spoke of the changing attitude 
	among Japanese Americans and the public.&nbsp; No longer were titles simple and 
	nice;&nbsp; instead, many of the titles aggressively called out to readers.&nbsp; <i>
	Behind Barbed Wire</i>, <i>In Search of Justice</i>, <i>Concentration Camps 
	USA</i>, and <i>Personal Justice Denied</i> are just a few examples of the 
	hard-hitting and compelling titles displayed on literature after 1970.&nbsp;	</span></p>

	American World War Two experience.&nbsp; The exhibit successfully reached over 
	100,000 people and acted as a turning point for many who viewed it.&nbsp; It 
	presented internment in the voice of Japanese Americans, and indicated that 
	they were ready for action to seek redress.&nbsp; The exhibit was also seen by 
	non-Japanese.&nbsp; The revelation to whites and other groups about what had 
	happened to the Japanese created an audience more receptive to the campaign 
	for redress. &nbsp;The exhibit created a yearning for more knowledge about

	credited with having provided an important spark to the movement for redress 
	in the Japanese American community. In <i>Born in Seattle</i>, author 
	Shimabukuro reports that within the traveling dates of “Pride and Shame” the 
	initial plans for redress were presented by Henry Miyatake at a Seattle JACL 
	meeting.<a name="_ednref47" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[47]</span></span></a> 
	The issue had a galvanizing effect in Seattle, and a ripple effect 
	throughout the nation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite increased action 
	towards redress and publicity about Japanese internment, justice was a long 
	time coming.&nbsp; Not until 18 years after the showcasing of “Pride and Shame” 
	did the Japanese American community receive a belated apology.&nbsp; On August 
	10, 1988, President Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act into law.&nbsp; This 
	act awarded those interned a “national apology and monetary compensation to 
	the surviving Japanese Americans” affected by internment.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">
	<a name="_ednref48" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn48">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">
	[48]</span></a></span></span>&nbsp; Each interned person was to receive a check 
	for $20,000 from the federal government as restitution for their suffering 
	and property losses.&nbsp; These reparations paid to thousands of surviving 
	individuals would not have been possible without the determination and hard 
	work of the Seattle JACL, including one of its first attempts at&nbsp; “Pride and 
	Shame.”&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As reported in <i>Born 
	in Seattle</i>, the Seattle JACL pushed the national JACL to take up the 
	issue.&nbsp; Seattle Representative Mike Lowry introduced the first redress 
	legislation to the U.S. House on November 28, 1979.&nbsp; As Lowry later noted, 
	“If you had to say what’s the one reason of the redress legislation passing, 
	it was because of the Seattle Chapter JACL.”<a name="_ednref49" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[49]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The “Pride and Shame” exhibit appeared to have subtle effects, but they were 
	far-reaching and powerful on levels from personal suffering to national 
	history.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In today’s fast-paced, 
	high-tech world, information and education about internment is readily 
	available and commonly known.&nbsp; This has not always been the case, however.&nbsp; 
	Not until after the “Pride and Shame” exhibit in 1970 did literature about 
	Japanese relocation and internment become widely available.&nbsp; The increasing 
	production of internment and redress concerned literature reflected the 
	growing support and publicity of the redress movement.&nbsp; Because of “Pride 
	and Shame” a community that had repressed its feelings and its history was 
	better able to talk about their experiences and emotions.&nbsp; Because of “Pride 
	and Shame” many people unfamiliar with the injustice imposed upon the 
	Japanese became informed.&nbsp; Because of “Pride and Shame” a community finally 
	became outraged at what had been done to them and fought for redress.&nbsp; 
	Because of “Pride and Shame” the priceless histories of an aging population 
	were captured before they were lost forever.</span></p>
