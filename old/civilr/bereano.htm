           <p class="arial10">Phil Bereano is Professor Emeritus in the field of Technology and Public Policy at the University of Washington. He also held Adjunct Professor appointments in Women Studies and American  Ethnic Studies. He joined the UW on faculty in 1975, and  taught previously at Cornell University where he earned two degrees, a Bachelor  of Chemical Engineering and a Master of Regional Planning. He also holds a law  degree from Columbia Law School. </p>
          <p class="arial10">Phil  is a recognized expert on the ethical and social considerations of  technologies, especially genetic engineering (having begun working on genetics  policy issues in 1977), including helping to define the notions of genetic  discrimination and genetic privacy.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="arial10"> Phil is an activist.&nbsp; Along with his scholarly articles, he &nbsp;has written popular pieces that  demystify many of the issues surrounding modern technological developments, consistent  with his commitment to public participation in social and governmental  decision-making.</p>
          <p class="arial10">He  has been an outspoken defender of civil liberties, especially with regard to  issues regarding LGBT/AIDS, and information technologies/-computer databases,  as well as genetics. &nbsp;&nbsp;For almost 20  years he has been a member of the National Board of the American Civil  Liberties Union and he chaired its Committee on Databases and Civil Liberties.  In 2009 he received the William O Douglas award from the ACLU&rsquo;s Washington  State affiliate for &ldquo;sustained contributions to the cause of civil liberties.&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="arial10">He was  a founding member of a number of international, national and community  organizations, including the Washington Rainbow Coalition and ACT/UP Seattle.  The latter established the first US large-city on-the-street AIDS prevention  needle exchange and also broke the obstruction of local developers to the  construction of the Bailey-Boushey AIDS hospice/adult day center&mdash;two  significant achievements in the struggles, which were widely emulated  elsewhere. </p>
          <p class="arial10">Among other honors, in 1994 Bereano received the  University of Washington's Outstanding Public Service Award and also a  Recognition Award from the King County Council, for &ldquo;warn[ing] against the  threat to democracy due to limiting public participation in decisions about  science and technology; and urg[ing] experts and scientists to do more to help  community groups understand technological phenomena which could improve their  lives as a means to re-empower our citizenry&hellip;. His involvement in the community  and the scientific world has set a standard of service for others to recognize  and follow.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="arial10">Phil Bereano shared  this interview  with Kevin McKenna on August 6, 2014. To the right are video excerpts from the interview. The full interview is preserved in Special Collections Library, University of Washington. </p>
