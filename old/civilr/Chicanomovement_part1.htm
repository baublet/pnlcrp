	Civil rights<b> </b>activism in Washington’s Mexican-American community has 
	its roots in two locales, the rural agricultural communities of the Yakima 
	Valley and the Seattle urban area. This dualistic geography is reflected in 
	the movement's activities, which by the late 1960s united the farm workers' 
	struggle in the eastern portion of the state with campaigns targeting 
	community and educational objectives in western Washington.</span></p>

	</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;Much of this 
	activism was generated by Chicano youth, and in particular students at the 
	University of Washington and other campuses throughout the state. Students 
	formed local chapters of the United Mexican American Students, the Brown 
	Berets, and Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlan, among other 
	organizations, and spearheaded initiatives both on and off-campus like the 
	United Farm Workers Cooperative and the UFW grape boycott, El Centro de La 
	Raza, SEAMAR and Consejo community health centers, and the Chicano Studies 
	program at the UW. </span></p>

	The Chicano movement was a cultural as well as a 
	political movement, helping to construct new, transnational cultural 
	identities and fueling a renaissance in politically charged visual, 
	literary, and performance art. Active through the 1970s, the movement 
	fragmented and lost momentum in the 1980s but has reemerged in recent years 
	as a new generation of Chicano activists, building on the legacy of their 
	predecessors, have mobilized around the issues of affirmative action, 
	globalization, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and, most recently, 
	immigrant rights.&nbsp; </span><b>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though there is much 
	debate over when the Chicano Movement as a whole began in the state of 
	Washington, there is general agreement on the initiation of the student 
	movement. In the late 1960s, Mexican-American youth, inspired by the farm 
	workers’ strike in California, the African American freedom struggle, and 
	the youth revolts of the time, began using the label ‘Chicano’ to denote 
	their cultural heritage and assert their youthful energy and militancy. In 
	appropriating a word that previously had a negative connotation, 
	Mexican-American youth turned ‘Chicano’ into a politically charged term used 
	for self-identification. Though there was activism at the individual level 
	at Yakima Valley College and the University of Washington, the establishment 
	of a movement organization did not take place until the fall of 1968, when 
	the first large group of Chicano students arrived at the University of 
	Washington in Seattle. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Chicano presence at the UW owed a great deal to the 
	Black Student Union's (BSU) militant efforts to promote campus diversity. On 
	May 20th 1968, BSU members occupied the offices of University of Washington 
	President Charles Odegaard.<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[1]</span></span></a> 
	The group organized a four hour sit-in where they voiced their demands for 
	making the University more relevant to people of color by improving the 
	recruitment of minority students, doubling black enrollment, increasing 
	funding for minority student programming, and creating black studies 
	courses. The BSU would lay the foundation for the recruitment of students 
	from throughout the state, including Mexican-Americans. According to Jeremy 
	Simer, &quot;this connection between the BSU and Chicano students would later be 
	strengthened by collaborative efforts on campus.”<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[2]</span></span></a> 
	Of the thirty-five students that were recruited in 1968, most were from the 
	Yakima Valley, the area that had the largest concentration of Latinos in 
	Washington State. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At this time, the Yakima 
	Valley had already seen the emergence of Chicano activism. Inspired by the 
	United Farm Workers Organizing Committee’s (UFWOC) grape boycott, two 
	students from Yakima Valley College, Guadalupe Gamboa and Tomas Villanueva, 
	traveled down to Delano, California in 1967 and met with UFWOC leader Cesar 
	Chavez. Upon returning, Gamboa and Villanueva co-founded the United Farm 
	Worker’s Co-operative (UFWC) in Toppenish, Washington.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[3]</span></span></a> 
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The UFWC is credited as being the first activist Chicano organization in the 
	state of Washington. Founded amid several War on Poverty efforts in the 
	Valley, Tomas Villanueva recalled that the UFWC was &quot;completely 
	non-governmental.&quot; &quot;I convinced people to give $5 into their shares and I 
	got very successful. I got enough that would build a little store. It was 
	very small to start with and we started running a sort of service defending 
	people when growers did not pay their wages or when people got injured. We 
	got people to get food stamps and those things. Then we found a bigger 
	building for the co-op.”<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[4]</span></span></a> 
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the summer of 1968, the UFWC solicited the assistance of the Washington 
	American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in a project that provided legal aid 
	to people of farm working background. The report that emerged from the 
	project underlined the conditions present in the Valley that forced Chicanos 
	into a state of political and economic subjugation. As a result of various 
	lawsuits filed through the ACLU, Yakima County was forced to take measures 
	to ensure that Chicanos were afforded voting rights and bilingual ballots, 
	as well as other considerations given to all people under the law.<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
	Though the UFWC organized workers during the wildcat strikes in the hop 
	fields of Yakima County in 1970, the organization would not receive official 
	recognition until the mid 1980s when it became the United Farm Workers of 
	Washington State. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to the UFW 
	Co-op, there were other forms of activism in the Yakima Valley. The Cursillo 
	Movement was organized through the Catholic Church. Though politically 
	moderate, its purpose was to engage people in social action and encourage 
	participation in church life. Another group formed in 1967, the Mexican 
	American Federation (MAF), pointed toward a new direction in&nbsp; 
	Mexican-American community organizing. In previous decades, most 
	associations were social and cultural in nature. MAF was one of the first 
	groups to advocate for community development and political empowerment in 
	the Yakima Valley. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The fall of 1968 was 
	characterized by social upheaval throughout the nation and the world. 
	Universities at this time were hubs for political activity and discourse. 
	Chicano students at the UW, few as they were, were inspired by this 
	activity. They already possessed an understanding of the plight of farm 
	workers as well as of the repressive, race-prejudiced system of power. Soon 
	after setting foot on the UW Campus, the thirty-five Chicano students, led 
	by Jose Correa, Antonio Salazar, Eron Maltos, Jesus Lemos, Erasmo Gamboa, 
	and Eloy Apodaca, among many others, formed the first chapter of the United 
	Mexican American Students (UMAS) in the Northwest. Modeled after the group 
	that was founded at the University of Southern California in 1967, UW UMAS 
	worked to establish a Mexican-American Studies class through the College of 
	Arts &amp; Sciences. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	UMAS also engaged in a campaign to halt the sale of non-union table grapes 
	at the University of Washington. Working alongside other activist 
	organizations such as the BSU, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and 
	members of the Associated Students of the University of Washington Board of 
	Control and the Young Socialist Alliance, the group first petitioned the 
	dormitories to stop selling grapes in their eating facilities, and quickly 
	secured an agreement. But efforts to persuade the Husky Union Building (HUB) 
	to cooperate proved more difficult.<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[6]</span></span></a> 
	Nevertheless, on February 17, 1969 the UW Grape Boycott Committee was 
	victorious as the HUB officially halted the sale of grapes.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
	The victory made the University of Washington the first campus in the United 
	States to remove grapes entirely from its eating facilities.&nbsp;Even more 
	notable was the organization’s skill at building coalitions among other 
	undergraduate groups, as evidenced by the diverse array of student groups on 
	the boycott committee.<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
	At the national level, the grape boycott organized by the UFWOC achieved 
	success in 1970 when the union won a contract. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to the 
	boycott, UMAS also called a conference in Toppenish to generate support for 
	the creation of Chicano youth groups at the high school and college levels. 
	With the assistance of UW faculty, UMAS created ‘La Escuelita’<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[9]</span></span></a> 
	in Granger in 1969, which in turn led to the creation of the <i>calmecac</i> 
	project (school in Nahuatl), a program that taught history and culture to 
	Chicano youth in Eastern Washington. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The student movement was 
	also spreading to other campuses. Following the lead of UW UMAS, Chicano 
	students organized at Yakima Valley College to form a chapter of the Mexican 
	American Student Association (MASA) in 1969.&nbsp;MASA, like UMAS, had its roots 
	in southern California, originating out of East Los Angeles College. Later 
	in 1969, Chicano students who had made their way to Washington State 
	University in 1967 via the High School Equivalency Program organized another 
	MASA chapter in Pullman. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1969 was a watershed year in activism at the 
	national level as well. The Chicano Youth Liberation Conference, hosted by 
	Corky Gonzalez’s Crusade for Justice in Denver, Colorado, laid the framework 
	for a youth-initiated Chicano Power Movement. The conference produced one of 
	the key documents of the period, “El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan,” which 
	rejected the earlier stance of most Mexican-American organizations and 
	instead advocated a separate, third political space, away from both the 
	political mainstream and the white-dominated student Left, which initially 
	marginalized people of color. The conference also urged cultural 
	regeneration, the negation of assimilation into the dominant society, and 
	Chicano self-determination. This emphasis on cultural nationalism would 
	persist well into the late seventies before the concept of activism ‘<i>sin 
	fronteras</i>’ (without borders) and Marxist critiques of empire transformed 
	the Chicano Left&nbsp; and laid the foundation for the Zapatista National 
	Liberation Army’s (EZLN) revolution against neo-liberal economic doctrine in 
	Chiapas, Mexico on New Year’s Day 1994.<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[10]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chicano Movement focused considerable attention on 
	educational issues, especially access to higher education. Conscription and 
	the Viet Nam war raised the stakes for young Chicanos. Because of the 
	availability of student deferments, access to higher education often times 
	had literal life or death implications for Chicano youth who were at risk of 
	being conscripted. As a result of many of the concerns associated with 
	higher education, the Chicano Council on Higher Education, formed after the 
	Massive East Los Angeles High School Walkouts of 1968, 
	organized a conference at the University of California at Santa Barbara<a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[11]</span></span></a>.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;The 
	resulting document, &quot;El Plan de Santa Barbara,&quot; laid the framework for a 
	master plan related to curriculum, services, and access to higher education. 
	It became a blueprint for the implementation of Chicano Studies and EOP 
	programs throughout the West Coast, including the University of Washington, 
	and also outlined the role of the University in the community and in issues 
	of social justice. The conference also transformed the way Chicano students 
	organized themselves. The delegates decided to merge the many activist 
	organizations – UMAS, MASA, MASO, MASC, MAYO, among others – under the 
	umbrella of <i>El Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan</i> (The Chicano 
	Student Movement of Aztlan). MEChA soon became the primary vehicle for 
	student activism on campuses throughout the United States.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
	the fall of 1969, UW UMAS officially adopted the name MEChA. This reflected 
	a shift in consciousness as well as a generational change as members 
	rejected the term ‘Mexican-American’ in favor of the label ‘Chicano.’ Over 
	the next two years, Yakima Valley College and Washington State University 
	would follow suit. Throughout the 1970s, numerous MEChA chapters emerged in 
	Washington State, including groups in the Columbia Basin, at Seattle Central 
	Community College, Central Washington University, A.C. Davis High School in 
	Yakima, and various other communities.&nbsp; In April of 1972, students organized 
	the first statewide MEChA Conference at Yakima Valley College. The 
	conference resulted in the creation of a statewide board authorized to 
	facilitate communication between all MEChA chapters in Washington about 
	activities at the state level. Chicanos near the Spokane area waited until 
	1977 to organize at Eastern Washington University, and it wasn’t until 1978 
	that the organization affiliated with MEChA.<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[12]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">According to Jesus Rodriguez, in the few years after the organization was 
	established, “MEChA became more diversified and developed subgroups to deal 
	with specific problems in health, women’s issues, community concerns, 
	graduate students and so forth.”<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[13]</span></span></a> 
	In effect, MEChA became an umbrella organization that housed such groups as 
	Las Chicanas, the Brown Berets, the National Chicano Health Association, and 
	the Chicano Graduate and Professional Student Association. In fact, many 
	students were involved in multiple groups at one time, as there was 
	participation across the several entities presided over by MEChA.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	The Brown Berets</span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Throughout the period, 
	activism on campuses was accompanied by activism in the community, and the 
	Brown Berets emerged as a key organization linking students to communities 
	and to young people who were not enrolled in college. Brown Beret chapters 
	formed in both Yakima and Seattle and by 1970 had attracted over 200 
	members. Originally founded in California, the Brown Berets gave a new and 
	tougher look to the movement in the late 1960s.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;What would become the 
	Brown Berets originated when six young Chicanos formed the core of the Young 
	Citizens for Community Action (YCCA) in May of 1966 in Los Angeles. Far from 
	radical, the group participated with the Community Service Organization 
	(CSO), where they met with political leaders who, according to Ernesto 
	Chavez, &quot;schooled them in the ways of practical politics and community 
	organizing and who also introduced them to the now famed Cesar Chavez.”<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[14]</span></span></a> 
	With financial help from Father John B. Luce, rector of the Episcopal Church 
	of the Epiphany in Lincoln Heights, the group opened ‘La Piranya,’ a 
	coffeehouse that doubled as an office and meeting place where prominent 
	civil rights speakers spoke to increasing numbers of Chicano youth.<a name="_ednref15" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[15]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This activity attracted 
	police who began harassing young people at the coffeehouse. YCCA responded 
	by organizing protest demonstrations at nearby sheriff stations. Young 
	leaders such as David Sanchez viewed harassment at the coffeehouse as 
	symptomatic of the larger problem of police abuse in the Chicano community 
	and advocated a more militant stance. In January of 1968, the YCCA adopted a 
	new image and uniform, becoming the Brown Berets. As Chavez writes, “Law 
	enforcement abuses had transformed them from moderate reformers into 
	visually distinctive and combative crusaders on behalf of justice for 
	Chicanos.”<a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[16]</span></span></a> 
	By 1969, <i>La Causa</i>, the Berets newspaper, reported that the Brown 
	Berets had approximately twenty-eight chapters throughout the West Coast and 
	Midwest. Two of these chapters were in the state of Washington.<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[17]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The UW Brown Berets most 
	likely originated in Granger, Washington. The group was then transplanted to 
	Seattle as students from the Yakima Valley were recruited to the University 
	of Washington in the late sixties and early seventies. According to former 
	student activist Pedro Acevez, it was Carlos Trevin&#61469;o, Trevino's brother, 
	and Luis Gamboa who first &quot;came up with this Brown Beret thing.”<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[18]</span></span></a> 
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The organization was comprised mostly of motivated, militant university 
	students and youth from Seattle’s Chicano community. Rogelio Riojas recalls 
	that the Seattle chapter was a “group of men and women that wanted to work 
	at the community level.”<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[19]</span></span></a> 
	Much like the groups in Southern California, the UW Brown Berets donned 
	their distinctive headgear and military fatigues as a symbolic statement 
	that they were willing to fight for their communities, bringing attention to 
	the war at home in the <i>barrios</i> against racial discrimination, 
	poverty, and police brutality. The Brown Berets uncompromising stance on 
	these issues attracted Chicano youth to the organization. Referring to 
	instances when the Brown Berets acted in defense of students being harassed 
	or intimidated by others, Pedro Acevez recalls, “I perceived them as a 
	positive. [Sometimes] the muscle of the brown berets came in handy.”<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[20]</span></span></a> 
	On the other hand, older members of the community were more reluctant to 
	support the confrontational tactics of the Brown Berets, reflecting the 
	generational differences in the Chicano community.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Brown Berets 
	initiated or participated in a number of programs targeted at the specific 
	needs of the local community. According to Jesus Lemos, “in the winter of 
	1970, the Seattle chapter organized a ‘Food for Peace’ drive to gather food, 
	clothing and money in order to make and distribute Christmas baskets to the 
	Chicanos in the Yakima Valley who were in the most need.”<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
	The UW chapter also engaged in other activities such as the creation of a 
	legal defense fund for Chicano activists and active involvement in support 
	of UFW activities such as the grape boycott. As Riojas recalls, “we were 
	raising money for UFW, going to Olympia, and helping [in the] community.”<a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[22]</span></span></a> 
	The Brown Berets financed most activity through collection drives and 
	requesting funds from sympathetic staff and faculty at the University.<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[23]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The chapter in the 
	Yakima Valley also emerged as a strong force agitating for an end to Chicano 
	oppression in Central Washington. According to Lemos, “In the early part of 
	1970 they organized a five-mile march to the welfare office in Yakima to 
	protest the abuse of the Chicanos who were often ridiculed and treated with 
	great disrespect and insensitivity by the welfare authorities.”<a name="_ednref24" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[24]</span></span></a> 
	Along with this activity, the Yakima Valley Brown Berets also played a 
	supportive role in “La Escuelita” in Granger and were involved with other 
	groups in &quot;El An&#61469;o del Mexicano,” which sought an increased political role 
	for Chicanos in the Yakima Valley. However, the Yakima Valley chapter had 
	trouble maintaining consistent membership. It became inactive a few weeks 
	after the march on the welfare office in Yakima.<a name="_ednref25" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[25]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As time progressed, the 
	Seattle Brown Berets&nbsp; served more in the capacity of a subgroup under UW 
	MEChA.<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[26]</span></span></a> 
	For the remainder of the group’s “official” existence, it was the wing of 
	the Chicano student movement most closely rooted in the community.<a name="_ednref27" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[27]</span></span></a> 
	The Brown Berets also tried to launch the La Raza Unida Party in the state 
	of Washington.<a name="_ednref28" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[28]</span></span></a> 
	The party was an effort to unite Chicanos on both sides of the Cascade 
	Mountains. Despite this effort, La Raza Unida Party in Washington never grew 
	past its embryonic stage and folded before really taking off. In Seattle, 
	the Brown Berets acted as the ‘muscle’ during many of the demonstrations 
	that MEChA undertook on the UW campus and, much like the Black Panthers, 
	raised a red flag in conservative sectors of the white community. Along with 
	another subgroup, Las Chicanas, the Brown Berets were also an integral part 
	of the contingent that occupied the old Beacon Hill elementary school in 
	October of 1972 and demanded the creation of El Centro de La Raza. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	El Centro de La Raza</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The site of what is now 
	El Centro de La Raza lay abandoned by the Seattle school district for some 
	time before the occupation of the building on October 12, 1972. At the time, 
	many of the services provided for Seattle’s Chicano/Latino community were 
	scattered throughout the city. This decentralization made it difficult for 
	many who sought after services to obtain them. The economic crunch of the 
	early seventies saw many programs sent to the chopping block, as was the 
	case with one English as a Second Language program in the south end of 
	Seattle that had a social justice component. The takeover of the Beacon Hill 
	school was a response to the cancellation of the ESL program for the Chicano 
	community at South Seattle Community College. Students and community members 
	affected by the sudden closing of the program were instrumental in planning 
	the takeover. Juan Jose Bocanegra remembers, “we brought in Chicanos from 
	the University of Washington. Everyone just popped out of the cars and 
	started walking toward the door. The press started showing at around 9:00.”<a name="_ednref29" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[29]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The effort was 
	orchestrated with three main contingents that allowed for occupation while 
	keeping lines of communication open to the community and the city. “We would 
	have a team that would bring food and support, another group dealing with 
	the cops, and another to deal with the city, recalls Bocanegra.”<a name="_ednref30" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[30]</span></span></a> 
	The takeover lasted into 1973 as negotiations took place with the Seattle 
	City Council and the Seattle school district, all while demonstrators 
	occupied the old Beacon Hill school and made due without water or 
	electricity throughout the duration of the standoff. Ricardo Martinez, one 
	of the UW students involved in the takeover, recalls his experience: “I 
	remember the first few nights we were there. It was cold! It was really 
	cold, there was no heat, there was no power. ... The eventual takeover 
	lasted months. ... We would come and go, and spell each other.”<a name="_ednref31" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[31]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The struggle for El 
	Centro proved difficult. Although the campaign was spearheaded by the Latino 
	community, alliances across racial and ethnic lines were instrumental in 
	keeping up the fight with the Seattle City Council. At one point, activists 
	occupied the City Council chambers in an effort to force city leaders to 
	turn over the building. After much debate, the city of Seattle finally 
	conceded and allowed the use of the property for the creation of El Centro 
	de La Raza in 1973. As former Brown Beret Rogelio Riojas put it, “someone 
	opened the door and we went in and never left.”<a name="_ednref32" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[32]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At a time when there was 
	no distinct Chicano “barrio” in Seattle, the creation of a center that 
	housed many of the services that Chicanos lacked was a necessity. El Centro 
	became not only a community center, but also a civil rights organization 
	that developed progressive coalitions with activist groups rooted in other 
	ethnic communities, especially Native Americans. According to Ricardo 
	Martinez, “The genesis&quot; of the Beacon Hill takeover &quot;was that the Native 
	Americans had taken over the Daybreak center” at Fort Lawton.<a name="_ednref33" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[33]</span></span></a> 
	These alliances would continue throughout the 1970s and to the present day.&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Much of the social 
	justice work done by El Centro is outlined in its mission statement, which 
	includes &quot;ensuring access to services and advocating on behalf of people 
	regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, gender, level of income, 
	age, ability and sexual orientation.”<a name="_ednref34" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; vertical-align:baseline">[34]</span></span></a> 
	In later years, the organization was also involved in issues of labor, 
	including farm worker organizing in the state of Washington and supporting 
	much of the work done in California by Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and the 
	United Farm Workers Union. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">El Centro also worked in 
	solidarity with international struggles, most notably in Central and South 
	America. Roberto Maestas recalls an event El Centro hosted on behalf of 
	earthquake victims in Managua that attracted numerous Nicaraguan exiles 
	living in Seattle, many of whom had escaped the U.S.-backed Somoza family 
	dictatorship.<a name="_ednref35" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[35]</span></span></a> 
	This solidarity with the Central American community continued throughout the 
	1970s as El Centro helped maintain communication with the Sandinista 
	government, which ultimately overthrew the Somoza dictatorship in 1979. In 
	1983 El Centro de La Raza sent a delegation and a crew from Seattle's 
	KING-TV on a fact-finding mission to Nicaragua. The Sandinista government 
	hosted the delegation for a week as the group talked to people in the towns 
	affected by attacks by counterrevolutionary groups.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The creation of El 
	Centro de La Raza was the result of a community coming together to forge 
	space for furthering the cause social justice for Latinos and Chicanos in 
	Seattle.<a name="_ednref36" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[36]</span></span></a> 
	El Centro represented one of the first major attempts in the Seattle area to 
	create community institutions to better conditions for the people. When 
	recalling the creation of the center, Ricardo Martinez remembers “how fun it 
	was being together with a bunch of people doing something that [we] thought 
	was the right thing to do for all the right reasons. [We] were hoping the 
	end results would justify what [we] were doing.”<a name="_ednref37" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[37]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The acute isolation for 
	many Chicanos from other cultural urban centers in the Southwest made the 
	interaction between students at the UW and the Chicano community of Seattle 
	even more noteworthy. In fact, the Chicano student movement at the 
	University of Washington provided the impetus for new community institutions 
	and a new era in the development of the arts and literature in Seattle and 
	throughout the region. This energy would emerge through the efforts of staff 
	and faculty, as well as UW MEChA, the oldest student-initiated Chicano 
	activist organization in the Northwest.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At the community level, 
	former student activists sparked the creation of SEAMAR<a name="_ednref38" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[38]</span></span></a> 
	and Consejo<a name="_ednref39" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[39]</span></span></a> 
	community health centers in 1978. The two centers initially served the 
	Western Washington Latino community, expanding over time to other low-income 
	communities as well. SEMAR emulated the farm worker’s clinic in the Yakima 
	Valley by offering holistic medical services, while Consejo focused 
	primarily on mental health and chemical dependency. These institutions 
	remain vital in providing access to health care for the Chicano and Latino 
	immigrant communities. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In Seattle, the late 
	1970s witnessed the establishment of a chapter of the Center for Autonomous 
	Social Action (CASA).<a name="_ednref40" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[40]</span></span></a> 
	CASA, which was originally founded in Los Angeles in 1968, was a group that 
	blended cultural nationalism with Marxist-Leninist thought, becoming the 
	first Chicano Marxist organization organized by poor and working-class 
	Chicanos. The organization started as a mutual aid association that then 
	organized around ridding the local barrios of illegal drugs. As the group 
	developed, it began organizing workers regardless of legal status and forged 
	coalitions with Mexican socialists and the Puerto Rican Socialist Party. 
	This turn toward a more internationalist ideology was a reflection of the 
	changing demographics of the 1970s and was a response to a renewed 
	anti-immigrant backlash. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At the national level, the harsh anti-immigrant 
	policies brought forth by the Carter administration, as well as the 
	patrolling of the southern border by the Ku Klux Klan, prompted many Chicano 
	activists to take action by organizing opposition to the nativist sentiment 
	echoed by the right wing in the late 1970s. In the Yakima Valley the 
	contributions of community activists resulted in the creation of Radio KDNA 
	in 1979.<a name="_ednref41" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn41"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align:baseline">[41]</span></span></a> 
	KDNA was the first radio station to dedicate its entire programming to the 
	Spanish-speaking population of Eastern Washington. To this day, the station 
	is nationally recognized for progressive programming that serves to educate 
	people on various issues concerning health, labor, and culture. Much like 
	the organizations that were created in Seattle during the late 1970s, Radio 
	KDNA has been instrumental in advocating for the rights of workers 
	regardless of legal status. </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

			In 1968 Soledad Alatorre and Bert Corona set up the Center for 
			Autonomous Social Action-General Brotherhood of Workers (CASA-HGT). 
			The group is one of the first to spearhead a move toward organizing 
			both legal and undocumented workers under the banner of 'sin 
			fronteras' or 'without borders.' In 1973 CASA's ideology takes a 
			turn farther toward the left, making it the first Marxist-Leninist 
			Organization based inside the Chicano Community. The student element 
			comprised of a group of students from Los Angeles and Orange County 
			form El Comite Estudiantil del Pueblo. The group, made up primarily 
			of Chicano Marxists, sought &quot;anti-imperialist solidarity with 
			national and international student struggles, university reform, 
			self-determination against the 'imperial system,' and student-worker 
			unity.&quot; The group would later merge with CASA. The organization 
			would reach all throughout the west coast, with chapters as far away 
			as Chicago, Illinois, and as far north as Seattle, Washington(Also
