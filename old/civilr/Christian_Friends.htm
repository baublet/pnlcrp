	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	for Racial Equality (CFRE) was a unique and pioneering organization in 
	Seattle's civil rights history. Founded in 1942, the Christian Friends was a 
	product of the reaction of Christian social activism to Seattle's intergroup<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a> 
	tensions of the late nineteen&#8209;thirties and World War II. CFRE used education 
	as a way of combating prejudice and discrimination. However, the group's 
	main focus was on positive social interaction across race and religious 
	boundaries. This approach to race and religious relations set CFRE apart 
	from other civil rights groups and fostered the niche in which the Christian 
	Friends would flourish for the next thirty years. The Christian Friends 
	realized that improving race and religious relations in Seattle also 
	involved fighting discrimination through actions such as meeting with 
	businesses, writing letters to legislators, and supporting other civil 
	rights groups, but for the most part, CFRE left the legal and direct action 
	battles to other organizations. Though rarely involved in legal campaigns, 
	CFRE pioneered in race and religious relations and laid the groundwork, in 
	terms of community attitudes, that allowed political and legal campaigns to 
	be successful in the Seattle area.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Much of the success of 
	the Christian Friends can be credited to the work of its dedicated 
	volunteers. With their help, CFRE staffed an office, published the monthly
	<a href="news-racialequality.htm" ><strong><em>Racial Equality Bulletin</em></strong></a>, organized educational meetings and social 
	gatherings, and performed community outreach. The unique membership profile 
	of CFRE indicates why the organization enjoyed this volunteer base. 
	Approximately two&#8209;thirds of the organization was female and senior citizens 
	also composed much of the group. During the years CFRE was active 
	(1942&#8209;1970), many women were housewives and could volunteer time to support 
	CFRE. Most retired senior citizens had the opportunity to volunteer their 
	time and their expertise in certain fields.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Prior to World War II, 
	Seattle had acquired a reputation as a racially liberal city. Compared to 
	the regimented and confrontational race relations of the Southern and 
	Eastern parts of the United States, Seattle's racial climate was much more 
	benign. However, people of color were rarely given the same opportunities 
	and privileges of Seattle's white population. People of color were limited 
	to menial occupations, their housing was restricted to limited areas of the 
	city and they were excluded from certain recreational activities. However, 
	they were seldom denied service at restaurants and businesses. The 
	relatively small population of color in Seattle before the war was 
	responsible for keeping race relations from reaching the point of 
	confrontation. In the face of &quot;polite&quot; discrimination, African Americans, 
	Asian Americans and other groups of color forged their own cultural 
	communities that gave participants a purpose and a place. Small businesses, 
	newspapers, theatre groups, mutual aid organizations, nightclubs, sports 
	teams and churches were part of the cultural community that sustained 
	populations of color.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">World War Two changed 
	the Seattle scene dramatically. One of the most significant and lasting 
	changes was in the population. Military bases and industrial production 
	attracted young men and women from all over the nation. Seattle's pre&#8209;war 
	1940 population of 368,302 increased 44 percent during WWII to reach 530,000 
	in 1944.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a> 
	Seattle's population decreased to 467,591 by 1950, but proportionately more 
	people of color continued to reside in Seattle after the war, substantially 
	raising the percent population of colored people relative to the total 
	population between 1940 and 1950. Most notably, Seattle's African American 
	population grew by 400% between 1940 and 1950.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The large influx of 
	people of color during the WWll years affected both the white and the 
	pre&#8209;existing population of color. LeEtta Sanders King (for many years an 
	active CFRE member), described the feelings of Seattle's established black 
	community regarding the newly arrived blacks:</span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
	<p class="OmniPage5" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;line-height:
normal"><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I was quite 
	ashamed of them. They looked so bad... I tried not to see them... We felt 
	that they don't need to come up here in our wonderful country and spoil 
	things. There was a feeling of the people that were here of resentment 
	against them, the ones that were coming in. Because they were messing things 
	up.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></b></span></span></a></span></i></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The local black 
	newspaper, <i>Northwest Enterprise, </i>expressed similar concern when it 
	said &quot;as long as one member of our race compels criticism from other races 
	for being uncouth, ignorant, and dirty, so does our entire race receive a 
	full share of that criticism.”<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
	Despite the resentment towards the newcomers, the migrants would soon become 
	integrated into Seattle's black community and assume leadership roles. 
	Reverend Fountain W. Penick arrived in 1942 and the attorney Charles Stokes 
	in 1944. These men, both of whom became prominent CFRE members, were leaders 
	of Seattle's black community; Penick, through the church, and Stokes as 
	Seattle's first black legislator.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a> 
	Organizations such as the Association for Tolerance (1943) and the 
	Fellowship Committee of black churches (1944) were created to help the 
	integration process.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Segments of the white 
	population of Seattle responded to the influx of people of color in various 
	ways. Some refused service to people of color, hanging signs reading &quot;We 
	Cater to Whites Only.&quot;<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
	Restrictive covenants prohibited people of color from moving out of the 
	Central District and into white neighborhoods. In many cases, if a family of 
	color were able to move into a previously all&#8209;white neighborhood, the white 
	neighbors would circulate petitions, harass and threaten the family of color 
	in an effort to force the family to leave.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a> 
	The signs and the petitions are evidence that Seattle's once discreet and 
	&quot;benign&quot; racism was becoming more overt as larger numbers of people of color 
	moved into the area.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:36.5pt;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The more outright racism 
	led to a confrontational atmosphere that began to affect community relations 
	negatively. In response, groups and organizations such as the American 
	Friends' Service Committee, the Race Relations Department of the Seattle 
	Council of Churches, the Anti&#8209;Defamation League and the Christian Friends 
	for Racial Equality were formed to foster better race relations in Seattle. 
	Other organizations, like the NAACP, the Japanese American Citizens League 
	and the Seattle Urban League, experienced an increase in membership. At the 
	request of private race relations groups, Seattle's Mayor Devin created the 
	Seattle Civic Unity Committee in February of 1944. This committee, like the 
	others springing up across the nation at that time, responded to complaints 
	of discrimination, exerted influence over race&#8209;relations public opinion in 
	Seattle, and was a leader and coordinator of positive race relations efforts 
	throughout the city.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It was this scene that 
	Victor Carreon entered. He had been a student of the American Baptist 
	missionary Edith Steinmetz in the Philippines. Her teachings on democracy, 
	drawn from the Bible and the United States Constitution, inspired Carreon to 
	&quot;LIVE the Christian life.&quot;<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a> 
	After teaching in the Philippines for several years, Carreon came to Seattle 
	to earn a college education. But when he arrived in the U. S., the 
	democratic conditions described by Steinmetz were sorely lacking for people 
	of color. Excluded from housing, employment and recreation, Carreon's 
	greatest disappointment was the ill treatment he received in Seattle 
	churches.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Steinmetz's first 
	meeting with Carreon since in the United States was in a Filipino Christian 
	Fellowship in 1939. He told her of his troubles and the similar plight of 
	people of color in Seattle. He asked Steinmetz for her help to bring 
	together Christians of various races and denominations to meet to discuss 
	their problems and work towards their solutions.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[13]</span></a></span></p>

	twenty&#8209;five persons gathered together for the first of the monthly luncheon 
	programs at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). Those twenty&#8209;five 
	included African Americans, Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, Filipino 
	Americans, whites and a Native American. The monthly luncheons featured 
	speakers describing the conditions and problems of local racial groups. 
	Attendance varied from a dozen to over thirty. In addition to informing 
	those present about local racial conditions, the small luncheons gave a much 
	valued opportunity for friendships to form regardless of racial lines.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[14]</span></a></span></p>

	Seven Christian denominations and the Jewish faith were represented as well 
	as the previously mentioned people of color from the luncheon except for 
	Japanese Americans who were interned during WWII. It was the friendships

	necessarily active in the local group. Steinmetz noted in her &quot;Twenty Years 
	History of the Christian Friends for Racial Equality,&quot; that a number of WWII 
	servicemen were among those who signed membership cards. She hoped that the 
	servicemen would spread the CFRE message around the world.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[23]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another factor that 
	helped increase membership was the prestige value of the Christian Friends. 
	CFRE sought to extend influence over the local community by enlisting the 
	support of popular community leaders as allies. These allies were listed as 
	&quot;sponsors&quot; on CFRE letterhead (there were about thirty at a time). The role 
	of sponsor did not include duties, except to promote and support the 
	Christian Friends; thus sponsorship was different from serving on the 
	Executive Board (which was later listed on CFRE letterhead when the system 
	of sponsorship was dissolved). A December 20, 1946 letter to Stimson Bullitt 
	from CFRE thanked him for &quot;the use of [his] name as Sponsor, and for the 
	added strength [that this gave the CFRE] effort.”<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The sponsors of CFRE 
	were both male and female and represented many races, religions and social 
	backgrounds; all were active in improving race relations in Seattle. Arthur 
	G. Barnett was president of the Seattle Civic Unity Committee and the trial 
	lawyer for Gordon Hirabayashi in the losing Supreme Court Case that 
	challenged the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a> 
	Stimson Bullitt was a member of the wealthy and prominent Bullitt family. 
	His mother, Dorothy Bullitt, had founded KING broadcasting and the family 
	was well known for their community service and charitable activities. Bertha 
	Campbell, a charter member of the Christian Friends, was also an early board 
	member of the Seattle Urban League and a founding member of Delta Sigma 
	Theta, one of the largest African American sororities in the nation.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a> 
	Dr. Felix B. Cooper was one of the founders of the Seattle Urban League.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a> 
	Dean E. Hart served as the executive secretary for the Seattle Urban League.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a> 
	Letcher Yarbrough was the president of the Seattle and Washington state 
	chapters of the NAACP, appointed to the Civic Unity Committee and active in 
	the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Urban League and CFRE.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">With the support of so 
	many prominent civil leaders in Seattle, the membership and activities of 
	the Christian Friends soared. By its fourteenth year (1956), CFRE had become 
	the largest interracial civil rights organization in Seattle's history.<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[30]</span></span></a> 
	CFRE had a membership advantage because it included people who were excluded 
	from other civil rights groups. Whites felt comfortable in CFRE because it 
	was interracial and not focused on a single race. Women were not 
	marginalized in CFRE; they composed much of the membership and frequently 
	served in high leadership positions.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:35.25pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Many of the members 
	of the Christian Friends were active in other civil rights and community 
	betterment organizations. This indicates several things about CFRE and its 
	members. Firstly, it shows that in addition to official coordination with 
	like&#8209;minded groups, cross&#8209;membership expanded cooperation between the 
	organizations. Secondly, cross&#8209;membership indicates that CFRE performed a 
	function that was not served by the other organizations. Thus, CFRE occupied 
	a niche in the Seattle community. The social focus of the Christian Friends 
	was its rare and appealing function. The Christian Friends aimed to create 
	an enjoyable social environment in which interracial and interfaith 
	exchanges could take place. CFRE organized theater outings, small teas and 
	luncheons, picnics, nature walks, folk dances and art classes. These 
	interracial social activities supplemented the educational and political 
	work of the Christian Friends and other civil rights organizations, making 
	CFRE attractive to members of other groups.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:35.25pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Women were 
	particularly active in CFRE and composed approximately two-thirds (67%) of 
	its membership and 72% of its officers.<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[31]</span></a> 
	The Christian Friends appealed to women not only because of its commitment 
	to civil rights and Christian Brotherhood, but also for the social 
	activities and the leadership and volunteer possibilities that were not 
	available to them in many other organizations at that time.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:35.25pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Women may have had 
	an advantage over men with regards to participation in CFRE. During the 
	nineteen&#8209;forties, fifties and early sixties, many women were housewives. 
	These women had much more unallocated time than a person who was working a 
	full&#8209;time job (typically males). Flexible schedules allowed these women to 
	perform volunteer work and to be more active in the organization than many 
	men (retirees are one large exception). CFRE did not have dues and thus did 
	not receive much money beyond the minimum to keep the organization running. 
	In CFRE, volunteer work was essential to maintain the organization. Though 
	the Christian Friends were occasionally able to hire a part&#8209;time secretary, 
	volunteers performed much of the office work. Not only did volunteers staff 
	the downtown office five days a week, but they also mimeographed, hand 
	addressed and postmarked the <u>Racial Equality Bulletin n </u>(REB).&nbsp; CFRE 
	volunteers in committees coordinated speakers for meetings, planned music 
	and entertainment, organized social events, researched racial conditions in 
	Seattle, compiled the <u>Racial Equality Bulletin</u>, publicized CFRE's 
	work and encouraged new membership. The volunteer base allowed the Christian 
	Friends to accomplish as much as it did.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Retirees helped to meet 
	this demand for volunteer support. A large number of CFRE members were 
	senior citizens. The <u>REB</u> carried obituaries of its members, noted 
	when members were ill and occasionally listed members' ages. The large 
	number of illnesses and deaths in the membership suggests that there were 
	numerous senior citizens in the group. Additionally, a newspaper article 
	about CFRE described many of its members as belonging to &quot;an older 
	generation.&quot;<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[32]</span></a> 
	Many men who were active in CFRE almost certainly had to be retired in order 
	to donate so much of their time to the organization. This was the case of 
	charter member Dr. Fred Ring, CFRE member and civic leader Dr. Felix B. 
	Cooper and CFRE president (1957&#8209;1959) P. Allen Rickles.<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[33]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The large presence of 
	retirees supports the idea that CFRE, while it was a liberal organization, 
	used conservative methods in its approach to better interracial and 
	interfaith relations. The Christian Friends did not organize sit&#8209;ins, 
	rallies or demonstrations to further its agenda. Rather, CFRE held lectures 
	and distributed pamphlets to educate the community.<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[34]</span></a> 
	Through this method, the Christian Friends garnered more widespread support 
	than if the organization had chosen a more radical method.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Middle and upper social 
	classes were drawn to CFRE because of its more conservative methods. The 
	role of sponsors in CFRE also attracted persons who aspired to the same 
	commercial and civic prominence as the sponsors. Many of the African 
	Americans involved in CFRE were those who had been living in Seattle prior 
	to WWII. These people saw themselves as members of the upper class of 
	Seattle's African American community; most of them were not confrontational 
	in their approach to race relations. Interracial organizations such as CFRE 
	appealed to these people.<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[35]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There is not much data 
	as to the social class of members, except that one can infer that primarily 
	membership came from the middle and upper classes. The members written about 
	in the <u>REB</u> include doctors, professors, lawyers, ministers and other 
	professionals. Judging from the education program of CFRE, the lectures, the 
	panel discussions, suggested reading lists and the news items in the <u>REB</u>, 
	the content of CFRE was geared for a well&#8209;educated membership. Finally, CFRE 
	chose traditionally upper-middle class social activities such as theater 
	outings, spring teas and folk dancing.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The racial composition 
	of CFRE is hard to determine. Members were never listed as R. Johnson 
	(black) and C. Johnson (white) when described in the <u>REB</u>. However, 
	other associations that members belonged to, like NAACP and Jack and Jill, 
	were written about in the <u>Bulletin</u> and pictures of members were 
	sometimes published in obituaries. According to this data, there seems to 
	have been a fairly even number of whites and African Americans in CFRE 
	followed by a small number of Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans, Native 
	Americans and Mexican Americans. For the most part, it seems that the 
	elected officers reflected the composition of CFRE. One exception is that, 
	though they served as officers, no African American held the position of 
	president until Mrs. Albert Chaney was elected in 1961 (the group's 
	nineteenth year).<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[36]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though named the 
	Christian Friends for Racial Equality, the organization had a number of 
	Jewish members.<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[37]</span></a> 
	One of the charter members of CFRE was Jewish (unnamed) as was executive 
	board member Rabbi Joseph Wagner (1955&#8209;1957) and one of CFRE's most beloved 
	presidents, P. Allen Rickles (1957&#8209;1959).<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[38]</span></a> 
	Jewish participation in racial and religious equality groups had 
	historically been strong in the Seattle area. In addition to founding their 
	own civil rights organizations, like the Jewish Federation of Greater 
	Seattle, the Jewish community of Seattle was also active in the Seattle 
	NAACP. The Jewish community was subject to many restrictions because of its 
	faith and was among the first to benefit from civil rights legislation. The 
	Christian Friends welcomed its Jewish members as equals, they held meetings 
	in Jewish temples and even changed their name in 1967 to Christians <i>and
	</i>Friends for Racial Equality to allow &quot;Buddhists, Unitarians, Jews and 
	others [to] feel free to join.”<a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[39]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE's membership 
	profile was distinct from other civil rights groups: two&#8209;thirds of the group 
	was female and there were many senior citizens active in CFRE. The group was 
	primarily white and African American with a small number of members from 
	other races. The Christian Friends was geared toward the middle and upper 
	social classes in terms of content, activities and methods. In comparison, 
	Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a national, interracial organization 
	spanning the same dates as CFRE had a different membership profile. Seattle 
	CORE members tended to be between 20 and 40 years old, had low levels of 
	religious affiliation, were of middle and upper class levels and 
	well&#8209;educated; approximately half were white and the group was equally mixed 
	male and female.<a name="_ednref40" title href="#_edn40"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[40]</span></a> 
	Most of the membership of the Seattle Branch of the NAACP was African 
	American. Judging from membership lists, a range of classes were 
	represented, from attorneys and ministers to cosmetologists and mail 
	carriers, however among the leadership positions, there was a much greater 
	concentration of professionals. Officers of the Seattle NAACP were almost 
	equally mixed male and female, but the Executive Board was predominately 
	male (over several years, the board averaged 85% male representation). 
	However, the general membership was more equal, 65% male and 35% female and 
	the volunteers were actually 70% female.<a name="_ednref41" title href="#_edn41"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[41]</span></a> 
	Comparing the membership of CFRE to other civil rights groups like the NAACP 
	and CORE helps to illustrate the niche filled by the Christian Friends.<a name="_ednref42" title href="#_edn42"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[42]</span></a> 
	CFRE differed from traditional organizations governed by men, from the 
	student civil rights groups, from purely political organizations and from 
	groups catering to a single race. In CFRE's inclusive niche, many came to 
	participate.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	for Racial Equality had an extremely close relationship with Seattle 
	churches. Victor Carreon came to Edith Steinmetz in 1939 because he felt 
	left out of Seattle's Christian community.<a name="_ednref43" title href="#_edn43"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[43]</span></a> 
	One of the major reasons CFRE was formed was to address the issue of 
	discrimination in Christian churches. Christian Friends believed that the 
	church should be a community leader in ending discrimination and in 
	emphasizing the idea of brotherhood regardless of race or creed.<a name="_ednref44" title href="#_edn44"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[44]</span></a> 
	Thus CFRE took on the role of educating and encouraging the church to be a 
	leader in promoting positive race and religious relations in Seattle.<a name="_ednref45" title href="#_edn45"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[45]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">To facilitate a close 
	working relationship with Seattle churches and to foster the inter&#8209;faith 
	atmosphere, CFRE decided to hold its monthly meetings in different churches 
	throughout the city.<a name="_ednref46" title href="#_edn46"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[46]</span></a> 
	Usually members of the church congregation (though not necessarily involved 
	with CFRE) attended these monthly meetings and helped organize the social 
	hour. This allowed those outside of CFRE to become familiar with CFRE's 
	purpose and activities.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE created the Church 
	Relations Committee in 1952 to determine how best to coordinate the 
	interests of the churches with CFRE's work in the race relations field. This 
	committee was composed of representatives from various denominations and 
	churches.<a name="_ednref47" title href="#_edn47"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[47]</span></a> 
	One of the projects of the Church Relations Committee was to mail out 250 
	letters to ministers and to chairs of churchwomen's associations that 
	expressed a desire for a closer relationship between CFRE and the churches, 
	especially in the field of human rights.<a name="_ednref48" title href="#_edn48"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[48]</span></a> 
	The committee encouraged the idea that ministers envision their church 
	community as including not only the members of the congregation but also 
	those living in the nearby area. The church should minister, through 
	out&#8209;reach programs, to its whole community.<a name="_ednref49" title href="#_edn49"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[49]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The discussion panel at 
	CFRE's March 1955 meeting pondered the question &quot;What Should the Church do 
	in Answer to Seattle's Intergroup Problems?&quot; Three main points emerged from 
	the discussion: the church should strive to make newcomers, regardless of 
	background, welcome; churches with homogenous backgrounds should strive to 
	understand other people and groups; and churches should lead, in word and 
	deed, the process of breaking down exclusive, all&#8209;white communities.<a name="_ednref50" title href="#_edn50"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[50]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another method of 
	maintaining close contact with the church leadership was to appoint six 
	ministers to the Executive Board of CFRE.<a name="_ednref51" title href="#_edn51"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[51]</span></a> 
	This ensured that the Christian Friends and<b> </b>the ministers were 
	keeping in contact with each other's activities and were aware of each 
	other's concerns. In several cases, CFRE would introduce a concern to the 
	ministers and ask for their help in taking action. Ministers were asked to 
	take the concern to their congregations and enlist the congregation's 
	support. For example, ministers had their congregations sign petitions 
	asking Seattle City Council to legislate against racial restrictions in 
	cemetery policies. The Puget Sound Association of Congregational Christian 
	Ministers went on record against racial restrictions and also resolved that 
	its name could be used by CFRE to protest discrimination.<a name="_ednref52" title href="#_edn52"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[52]</span></a> 
	The help of ministers was also asked for in the case of housing. CFRE asked 
	ministers of white congregations to &quot;encourage the property owners in their 
	churches to signify their willingness to sell or rent to persons in minority 
	groups&quot; and asked ministers of congregations of color to &quot;make available a 
	list of their members who wish to buy or rent.&quot;<a name="_ednref53" title href="#_edn53"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[53]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Ministers played an 
	active role in CFRE leadership. Not only were ministers members of the 
	executive board, but also they were frequently asked to speak on racial and 
	religious topics at CFRE monthly meetings. Examples of their meeting topics 
	included: Rev. Aron Gilmartin, &quot;Controversial Aspects of the New Bible;&quot; 
	Rabbi Martin Douglas, &quot;Customs and Ceremonials in Jewish Religious Life;&quot; 
	and Rev. Robert N. Peters, &quot;The March from Selma to Montgomery Alabama.”<a name="_ednref54" title href="#_edn54"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[54]</span></a> 
	Specific church concerns were also CFRE meeting topics; examples were: &quot;The 
	Church Seeks the Answer to Seattle's Intergroup Relations&quot; and &quot;What Should 
	the Churches do in Answer to Seattle's Intergroup Problems?&quot;<a name="_ednref55" title href="#_edn55"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[55]</span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Using the meeting 
	announcements from the <u>Racial Equality Bulletin </u>(1949 1968), the 
	churches in which CFRE held meetings could be determined.<a name="_ednref56" title href="#_edn56"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[56]</span></a> 
	These were the denominations that supported CFRE and that CFRE favored. (The 
	number of churches was limited because CFRE tried to choose churches with a 
	central location and bus access.) Baptist churches were clearly favored for 
	meetings, followed by Congregational, Episcopal, and Methodist. These 
	primary denominations had in common a history of social activism and several 
	were active in missionary work that led to the incorporation of members from 
	various races.<a name="_ednref57" title href="#_edn57"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[57]</span></a> 
	The Congregational church was known for its commitment to the abolition of 
	slavery and for civil rights. The Episcopal and Methodist churches were 
	fairly liberal protestant denominations, active in both civil rights and 
	humanitarian efforts. However, in keeping with their purpose of ending 
	religious discrimination through social acquaintance, the Christian Friends 
	also held meetings in churches of other faiths, though less frequently.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to working 
	with local churches on racial and religious issues, the Christian Friends 
	collaborated with well&#8209;known civil rights groups such as the Seattle branch 
	of the NAACP, the Seattle Urban League and CORE, as well as with lesser 
	known but locally active groups like the Jewish Federation of Greater 
	Seattle and the Washington State Anti&#8209;Discrimination League. CFRE members 
	who belonged to these and other organizations aided CFRE coordination with 
	these other groups. The relationship became especially close when these 
	&quot;cross&#8209;over&quot; members served in active positions in each group. </span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In much the same way

	board.<a name="_ednref58" title href="#_edn58"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[58]</span></a> 
	This allowed the groups to keep in contact and to help each other with

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Mayor William F. Devin 
	appointed the Seattle Civic Unity Committee in February 1944. CFRE noted in 
	its records that its letters to the mayor urging him to create a &quot;City 
	Interracial Committee&quot; contributed to the formation of the CUC.<a name="_ednref59" title href="#_edn59"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[59]</span></a> 
	Other contributing factors included the racial tension in the city and the 
	wave of civic unity committees forming all over the country. The CUC 
	recommended policies on racial matters to the mayor and city council, sought 
	to combat racial tension through information and education, dealt with 
	discrimination complaints and helped to coordinate the efforts of 
	organizations working to eliminate intergroup tensions in Seattle.<a name="_ednref60" title href="#_edn60"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[60]</span></a> 
	They organized these like&#8209;minded groups through the Coordinating Council. 
	Member groups included: the Urban League, Jackson Street Committee, NAACP, 
	Race Relations Committee of the American Veterans' Committee, Council of 
	Social Agencies, CFRE, Council of Churches, Young Women's Christian 
	Association and the Student Adjustment Committee of the University of 
	Washington.<a name="_ednref61" title href="#_edn61"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[61]</span></a> 
	The CUC also put together conferences on race relations and organized 
	speaking engagements.<a name="_ednref62" title href="#_edn62"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[62]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to formal 
	coordination, more intimate cooperation existed between CFRE and CUC. When 
	CFRE's office secretary was on vacation, CUC mimeographed hundreds of copies 
	of the <u>Racial Equality Bulletin </u>for distribution and when CFRE's 
	typewriter was broken, the CUC loaned one to CFRE.<a name="_ednref63" title href="#_edn63"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[63]</span></a> 
	When CUC was in a bind, CFRE office volunteers helped to address and post 
	letters for their annual meeting.<a name="_ednref64" title href="#_edn64"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[64]</span></a> 
	The support of each organization for the other is evidence of concern for 
	one another and the belief that they were allies working toward the common 
	cause of eliminating racial and religious discrimination and prejudice.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Mutual support between 
	the NAACP and CFRE included the Christian Friends printing notices of NAACP 
	meetings and membership drives in its publication, the <u>Racial Equality 
	Bulletin</u>. Over the years, the relationship grew stronger. In 1964, CFRE 
	was a contributing financial member of the NAACP and encouraged all of CFRE 
	members to become members of the NAACP.<a name="_ednref65" title href="#_edn65"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[65]</span></a> 
	When CFRE membership was in a state of decline and the group could no longer 
	keep its office, the president of the Seattle NAACP, June Smith, offered to 
	rent out space to CFRE in the NAACP office, an offer that the CFRE accepted 
	in March of 1966.<a name="_ednref66" title href="#_edn66"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[66]</span></a> 
	Collaboration included a picketing demonstration in front of the Woolworth 
	and Kress stores, organized by the NAACP and supported by individual CFRE 
	marchers. The demonstrators used the CFRE office as a resting place.<a name="_ednref67" title href="#_edn67"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[67]</span></a> 
	Several of CFRE's monthly meetings, like that of June 1960, &quot;Work of the 
	NAACP at the Present Time,&quot; specifically concerned the NAACP.<a name="_ednref68" title href="#_edn68"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[68]</span></a> 
	There was much cross-membership between the two organizations. Early CFRE 
	sponsor Letcher Yarbrough was also the president of the Seattle NAACP and 
	long&#8209;time CFRE music committee chair, LeEtta S. King, was a representative 
	of the Seattle NAACP to a national NAACP conference, an experience recorded 
	in CFRE's <u>Racial Equality Bulletin</u>.<a name="_ednref69" title href="#_edn69"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[69]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though they publicized 
	each other's meetings and publications, CFRE did not have an extensive 
	working relationship with the Seattle Urban League. Much of their 
	relationship came through Lewis Watts who served for some time as the 
	director and executive secretary of the Seattle Urban League and was a CFRE 
	member. Watts spoke at several of CFRE's monthly meetings, including that of 
	March 1953 on the subject of how race relations had changed in Seattle over 
	the previous decade.<a name="_ednref70" title href="#_edn70"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[70]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though differing in 
	method and membership profiles, the Congress of Racial Equality was 
	nevertheless the organization most similar to CFRE. Both developed from a 
	tradition of Christian social activism, both were founded in 1942 and 
	focused on interracial concerns.<a name="_ednref71" title href="#_edn71"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[71]</span></a> 
	In fact, the purposes of these groups were so similar that CFRE considered 
	becoming an affiliate of CORE in 1945. However, the majority of CFRE members 
	felt that they could not live up to the ideals of passive resistance upon 
	which CORE was based.<a name="_ednref72" title href="#_edn72"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[72]</span></a> 
	Though CFRE did not become a CORE affiliate, it did continue a strong 
	relationship with CORE, especially after the Seattle chapter of CORE was 
	established in July 1961. In addition to publicizing CORE's meetings in the
	<u>REB</u>, CFRE worked with the national CORE to bring Rev. George Houser, 
	national CORE chair, to Seattle in 1955.<a name="_ednref73" title href="#_edn73"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[73]</span></a> 
	Members of CORE spoke at several CFRE meetings, among them was Ray Cooper, 
	of the Seattle CORE chapter who described his participation in the Freedom 
	Rides.<a name="_ednref74" title href="#_edn74"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[74]</span></a> 
	In the nineteen&#8209;sixties, CFRE and CORE cooperated in a number of boycotts 
	that forced businesses to end their policy of hiring whites only.<a name="_ednref75" title href="#_edn75"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[75]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE coordinated with 
	other civil rights groups, though not as much as with the CUC, NAACP, CORE 
	and the Urban League. These groups were promoted in the <u>Racial Equality 
	Bulletin</u>, but did not share a close working relationships with CFRE. The 
	Christian Friends maintained contact with the other groups through the 
	Intergroup Agency Association facilitated by the Civic Unity Committee. 
	Groups represented included the American Jewish Committee, the 
	Anti&#8209;Defamation League, CFRE, CUC, the Urban League, and the State Board 
	Against Discrimination in Employment.<a name="_ednref76" title href="#_edn76"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[76]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another form of contact 
	was through the representatives of groups that were appointed to the CFRE 
	executive board. Organizations that were represented on this board include 
	the CUC, East Madison YMCA, Eastside YMCA, Family Life of Seattle Public 
	Schools, the University of Washington Sociology Department and the Council 
	of Churches.<a name="_ednref77" title href="#_edn77"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[77]</span></a> 
	Glen Mansfield and Lonnie Shields served as liaisons for CFRE to the 
	Washington State Anti-Discrimination League, the organization to which CFRE 
	referred discrimination complaints.<a name="_ednref78" title href="#_edn78"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[78]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	for Racial Equality was an active organization in Seattle throughout the 
	nineteen&#8209;forties, fifties and sixties. University of Washington sociologists 
	Ernest A. T. Barth and Baha Abu&#8209;Laban conducted a study in 1959 of the 
	African American community of Seattle. When participants were asked to list 
	the most influential local organizations, the Christian Friends was ranked 
	third behind the Seattle Urban League and the Seattle NAACP, respectively.<a name="_ednref79" title href="#_edn79"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[79]</span></a> 
	Each sub&#8209;community in Seattle would have ranked influential organizations 
	differently, but with 1,000 members, in a city of 550,000 people, CFRE was 
	an influential force in Seattle race relations.<a name="_ednref80" title href="#_edn80"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[80]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though ending prejudice 
	through social acquaintance was its primary objective, CFRE knew that it 
	also had to combat discriminatory acts and policies of the government, 
	businesses, property owners and even churches. CFRE attacked discrimination 
	in several ways. One of these was through the CFRE letter club. Members 
	wrote at least one letter a week to legislators, city council members and 
	businesses.<a name="_ednref81" title href="#_edn81"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[81]</span></a> 
	Some of the letters condemned discriminatory practices while trying to 
	further the principle of a single humanity. Other letters congratulated 
	businesses, churches and other organizations on their efforts to integrate, 
	hire people of color and serve people of color. Additionally, letters were 
	written in protest of the <i>Amos and Andy </i>television show, images of 
	blacks as butlers in magazine ads and stereotyped roles in movies.<a name="_ednref82" title href="#_edn82"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[82]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another approach used by 
	CFRE to fight discrimination was to visit stores and restaurants and speak 
	directly to the management about their practices. If CFRE investigated a 
	claim of discrimination, in a restaurant, several members would be sent 
	there in an interracial group. As charter member Bertha Pitts Campbell 
	explained, &quot;[that way we could] see if they discriminated and if they did, 
	we had the white person as a witness.<a name="_ednref83" title href="#_edn83"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[83]</span></a> 
	When approached in this manner, most restaurants offered equal service to 
	both patrons, regardless of race. This method was also used to persuade 
	businesses not to discriminate against Japanese Americans when they returned 
	from internment camps in 1944.<a name="_ednref84" title href="#_edn84"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[84]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	CFRE also used the tactic of personal interviews with doctors and hospital 
	administration to urge them and the King County Medical Association to 
	accept a policy of non&#8209;discrimination.<a name="_ednref85" title href="#_edn85"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[85]</span></a>&nbsp;	</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	took very seriously their role as community educators in regards to 
	interracial and interfaith concerns. One facet of this was the speakers' 
	bureau of CFRE. Composed of a dozen dedicated and knowledgeable CFRE 
	members, the speakers went to churches, youth groups, schools and other 
	organizations to talk about interracial and interfaith matters and to 
	facilitate discussions around those topics. In a typical two&#8209;week span in 
	February of 1952, bureau members spoke at eight engagements.<a name="_ednref86" title href="#_edn86"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[86]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The distribution of 
	pamphlets also served to educate the community. Most pamphlets were not 
	written by CFRE, but by authors and by organizations that were leaders in 
	the field of race relations. However, CFRE did produce a pamphlet called &quot;Do 
	You Know&quot; about the restrictions based on race in local cemeteries.<a name="_ednref87" title href="#_edn87"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[87]</span></a> 
	CFRE distributed pamphlets across the city, putting them in offices of 
	doctors and dentists, in schools and in church lobbies.<a name="_ednref88" title href="#_edn88"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[88]</span></a> 
	CFRE held a booth at Seafair and at the Evergreen State Fair to reach out to 
	the community with educational pamphlets and with information from the 
	volunteer staff.<a name="_ednref89" title href="#_edn89"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[89]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <u>Racial Equality 
	Bulletin</u>, published monthly by CFRE from May 1946 through the middle of 
	1968,<b> </b>was another great educational effort. In 1959, the <u>REB</u> 
	was being mailed to sixteen states and Canada.<a name="_ednref90" title href="#_edn90"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[90]</span></a> 
	The <u>Bulletin</u> was composed of meeting announcements for CFRE and other 
	similar groups, national and international news items relating to race and 
	religious relations that were taken from other sources and local news items 
	from newspapers and CFRE's own coverage. It was also partly a newsletter for 
	the Christian Friends and thus it contained news of members, updates of the 
	organization's board meetings, descriptions of CFRE meetings, suggested 
	reading lists and inspirational passages having to do with Christian faith, 
	brotherhood and carrying out CFRE's goals.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Each month the <u>
	Bulletin</u> was constructed by a five person Editorial Committee, who 
	mimeographed (later copied), hand&#8209;addressed and posted it to around 500 
	subscribers. Readers were asked to submit comments, suggestions and articles 
	for publication in the <u>Bulletin</u>.<a name="_ednref91" title href="#_edn91"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[91]</span></a> 
	In addition to individual subscribers, the University of Washington, Seattle 
	Public Schools and the Seattle Public Libraries subscribed to the <u>Racial 
	Equality Bulletin</u>. CFRE traded subscriptions with like&#8209;minded groups 
	such as the Friendship House in Chicago who printed the newsletter <u>
	Community</u> and the Community Relations Conference of Southern California 
	who printed <u>The Community Reporter</u>.<a name="_ednref92" title href="#_edn92"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[92]</span></a> 
	It is easy to see how the <u>Racial Equality Bulletin </u>reached so many 
	readers and was able to serve as both a news source and a vehicle of 
	exchange for CFRE ideas and information.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The meetings of the 
	Christian Friends were another important form of community education. 
	Notices were sent to local newspapers announcing the meetings and 
	cooperating churches also announced the meetings and their topics.<a name="_ednref93" title href="#_edn93"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[93]</span></a> 
	Members of the host church usually attended the meetings even if they were 
	not CFRE members and CFRE members were encouraged to bring friends to the 
	meetings to expose them to the CFRE mission. In this way, CFRE sought to 
	inform people outside of the CFRE network about interracial and interfaith 
	concerns. These meetings involved dynamic speakers and community leaders; 
	some were CFRE members. Notable speakers included: Glen Mansfield, Executive 
	Secretary of the Washington State Board Against Discrimination; Lewis Watts, 
	Director of the Seattle Urban League; George Houser, Executive Director of 
	the national CORE; Mark A. Smith, Administrator of Fair Employment Practices 
	Division (Oregon), and President of Portland Urban League; Robert Brooks, 
	Executive Secretary of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU); and Wing 
	Luke, Seattle City Councilman.<a name="_ednref94" title href="#_edn94"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[94]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The final form of 
	community education was performed through the individual acts of CFRE 
	members. This was the social acquaintance emphasis of the Christian Friends. 
	CFRE believed that social acquaintance and interaction by members of 
	different races and faiths would lead to human understanding and was the 
	only way to eliminate prejudice. The Christian Friends looked upon groups 
	like the NAACP as trying to legislate against discrimination, but CFRE 
	wanted to stop discrimination at its source: individual prejudice. Because 
	of this belief, CFRE engaged in relatively few legal and coercive means to 
	end discrimination.<a name="_ednref95" title href="#_edn95"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[95]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE practiced positive 
	social interaction in two ways: one was during the social hour of CFRE 
	meetings and the other was through members' daily interactions with people. 
	Articles in the <u>Racial Equality Bulletin </u>taught members how to 
	respond to prejudiced remarks and how to demonstrate the principle of 
	brotherhood.<a name="_ednref96" title href="#_edn96"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[96]</span></a> 
	CFRE meetings were even devoted to this topic and role&#8209;play helped members 
	feel confident in handling the situation.<a name="_ednref97" title href="#_edn97"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[97]</span></a> 
	When engaged in conversations with someone who had made a prejudiced 
	statement, CFRE members were taught never to be on the defensive and always 
	to be polite in explaining the errors of prejudice. In the forties, several 
	clauses were added to CFRE's Statement of Purpose to emphasize the 
	importance of social contact. This form of community outreach was 
	responsible for touching many Seattleites who may have otherwise never been 
	concerned with interracial and interfaith concerns.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Admittedly, the 
	Christian Friends' forum for social acquaintance was &quot;artificial.&quot; 
	Nevertheless, CFRE believed that despite the artificial organization of 
	potlucks, picnics, plays, teas, parties, square dances and luncheons, that 
	the fellowship that developed was real.<a name="_ednref98" title href="#_edn98"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[98]</span></a> 
	Though at first glance the Christian Friends appear to be affected, the 
	sincerity and care for race relations and each other in their circle of 
	“friends” comes through in their writings and in their volunteer work.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">An organized form of 
	education and social acquaintance was the interracial, interfaith home visit 
	program that originated in Cleveland and Chicago in the early sixties and 
	was adopted by the Christian Friends in 1964. Another Seattle group, the New 
	Year Callers had an annual activity similar to the interracial, interfaith 
	home visit day and many CFRE members had participated in the New Year 
	Callers events.<a name="_ednref99" title href="#_edn99"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[99]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	In the interracial, interfaith home visit program, families volunteered to 
	be callers or hosts. They were then paired with a family of a different race 
	or religion for a visit that usually involved light refreshments and a 
	discussion, sometimes with a topic and other times with no prescribed 
	subject.<a name="_ednref100" title href="#_edn100"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[100]</span></a> 
	The program was adopted by CFRE because, as CFRE president Reverend Robert 
	B. Shaw said, &quot;it [took] the surest method of combating prejudice personal 
	encounter with members of another race or faith.”<a name="_ednref101" title href="#_edn101"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[101]</span></a> 
	The home visit program grew from 75 participants in February of 1964 to 500 
	participants in the April 1965 Home Visit Day.<a name="_ednref102" title href="#_edn102"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[102]</span></a> 
	By April 1965, the Catholic Interracial Council, Temple De Hirsch and the 
	Christian Family Movement had joined CFRE in co&#8209;sponsoring the event.<a name="_ednref103" title href="#_edn103"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[103]</span></a> 
	Yet after these three home visit days in Seattle, the program was assessed 
	as being ineffectual. This was because home visit participants were those 
	who were already unprejudiced; the program couldn't influence the prejudiced 
	to rethink their attitudes because it could never induce prejudiced people 
	to participate.<a name="_ednref104" title href="#_edn104"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[104]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE was involved in 
	many projects to end discrimination in Seattle but there are two key 
	undertakings that highlight Christian Friends activism: ending racial and 
	religious cemetery restrictions and working for fair housing and 
	neighborhood integration. These two projects spanned many years and involved 
	massive amounts of research and community education. It was for these 
	projects that CFRE had to enlist the cooperation of other civil rights 
	organizations in order to mobilize the community to support these issues. 
	After much hard work and some disappointment, racial restrictions were 
	removed from Seattle cemeteries, restrictive covenants were deemed legally 
	unenforceable and the process of neighborhood integration was started.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE's interest in 
	cemetery discrimination began in 1945 after it had learned the disheartening 
	stories of an African American woman who was not allowed to purchase a plot 
	in the same cemetery as her white mother and of a Japanese American friend 
	of CFRE who was prohibited from purchasing a burial plot for his father 
	because of his race.<a name="_ednref105" title href="#_edn105"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[105]</span></a> 
	That year the Christian Friends conducted a survey to determine which 
	cemeteries had restrictions based on race. For several years, CFRE continued 
	to alert the community to the discriminatory restrictions of cemeteries 
	while it tried to organize support for the ending of these restrictive 
	policies. By 1948, churches supporting CFRE had circulated petitions signed 
	by 1100 people who favored ending the restrictive policies of cemeteries.<a name="_ednref106" title href="#_edn106"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[106]</span></a> 
	Several ministerial associations also spoke against the policies and wrote 
	letters to cemeteries stating their positions. The Puget Sound Ministers' 
	Association went on record denouncing restrictive covenants and segregation 
	in cemeteries as &quot;unchristian, uncivilized and unintelligent.”<a name="_ednref107" title href="#_edn107"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[107]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	The <i>Shelley vs. Kramer</i> Supreme Court decision in 1948 deemed 
	restrictive covenants legally unenforceable; CFRE argued this decision 
	applied to cemetery policies.<a name="_ednref108" title href="#_edn108"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[108]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After the Supreme Court 
	decision, CFRE mobilized to enlist the support of other organizations 
	against restrictions in cemetery policies. Groups and churches that allied 
	with CFRE included the Puget Sound Association of Congregational Ministers, 
	the Seattle Baptist Ministers and Missionaries, University Unitarian Church, 
	Green Lake Congregational Church, Methodist State Federation for Social 
	Action, Church of the People, Methodist Ministerial Association, Social 
	Action Committee of the University Congregational Church, First Baptist 
	Church and Seattle Presbyterian Church.<a name="_ednref109" title href="#_edn109"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[109]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	also worked to garner community support for ending cemetery restrictions. By 
	1949 CFRE had printed and distributed pamphlets, written by CFRE member 
	Ethelyn Hartwich, which stated the policies of local cemeteries.<a name="_ednref110" title href="#_edn110"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[110]</span></a> 
	The Civic Unity Committee had now joined the movement to end the restrictive 
	policies and held private meetings with the cemetery owners to discuss their 
	policies.<a name="_ednref111" title href="#_edn111"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[111]</span></a> 
	Community support to end the policies continued to grow and by 1951 the 
	issue became highly visible when the <u>Seattle Times</u> carried four 
	articles about cemetery policies written by Byron Fish. Despite CFRE's 
	intention to stay away from legal battles, it had scheduled meetings with 
	the Assistant to the State Attorney General to discuss cemetery policies.<a name="_ednref112" title href="#_edn112"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[112]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In February of 1953, the 
	Washington State Legislature passed a set of laws that regulated cemetery 
	operation. Among the regulations was the statement: &quot;It shall be unlawful 
	for any cemetery under this act to refuse burial to any person because such 
	person may not be of the Caucasian race.”<a name="_ednref113" title href="#_edn113"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[113]</span></a> 
	The passage of this statute concluded the work of the Christian Friends to 
	end racial cemetery restrictions. Knowing that this was a small victory, 
	CFRE vowed that there was more work to be done to wipe out discrimination 
	and to end prejudice.<a name="_ednref114" title href="#_edn114"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[114]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">One of the very first 
	civil rights groups to bring attention to housing, the Christian Friends' 
	work to end restrictive covenants began in early 1944. CFRE volunteers went 
	to the county&#8209;city building to collect deeds bearing restrictive covenants. 
	By late spring of 1944, CFRE had sent a letter, endorsed by civic and church 
	leaders, to pastors quoting the Broadmoor Covenant and asking for their 
	support towards ending restrictive covenants.<a name="_ednref115" title href="#_edn115"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[115]</span></a> 
	This restrictive covenant of a 23rd Avenue house, written into the contract 
	in 1938, was a typical example of a restrictive covenant:</span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:.5in;line-height:normal"><i>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The purchaser must be of 
	the white or Caucasian race and... the property is not to be sold, 
	encumbered, conveyed, leased or rented to any person who is not of the white 
	or Caucasian race. In the event of the violation of this covenant the title 
	to the property shall revert to the [name deleted] estate. This is also 
	binding on the heirs, administration, successors and assigns of the 
	purchaser.<a name="_ednref116" title href="#_edn116"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[116]</span></b></a></span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Over the next several 
	years, CFRE collected sixty&#8209;four covenants (a fraction of the total number 
	of restrictive covenants) and compiled them into an educational leaflet for 
	community distribution. CFRE wrote to the Seattle Realtors' Association to 
	express its &quot;uncompromising disapproval of racial and religious restrictions 
	in property deeds.”<a name="_ednref117" title href="#_edn117"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[117]</span></a> 
	Letters were also sent to legislators urging them to end segregation and 
	racial restrictions in federal housing.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Locally, CFRE had been 
	successful in raising awareness of restrictive covenants. In the spring of 
	1946, an African American attempted to buy a house in the Rainier District. 
	The residents of the district tried to create a restrictive covenant barring 
	the sale of homes in their neighborhood to people of color. When CFRE heard 
	of this, it alerted the community to the planned covenant. Enough community 
	members were against the covenant that it failed and the African American 
	was able to purchase the home.<a name="_ednref118" title href="#_edn118"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[118]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Letters continued to be

	By 1947 the leaflet containing the sixty&#8209;four covenants was finished. 
	Two&#8209;hundred&#8209;and&#8209;fifty copies of the fourteen page brochure were mimeographed 
	and distributed.<a name="_ednref120" title href="#_edn120"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[120]</span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">With the <i>Shelley vs. 
	Kramer </i>Supreme Court decision of 1948 declaring restrictive covenants 
	unenforceable, CFRE now turned its attention to neighborhood integration, 
	believing that church and school integration would result from integrated 
	neighborhoods. CFRE also believed that Christians, being a large portion of 
	Seattle's population had the power to determine community attitudes; their 
	cooperation towards integrated housing would lead to integrated 
	neighborhoods.<a name="_ednref121" title href="#_edn121"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[121]</span></a> 
	CFRE tried to create a listing service for buyers of color that matched them 
	with sellers who were from predominantly white neighborhoods. Pastors were 
	asked to enlist willing members of their congregation to participate in this 
	matching service and to create a church environment that was favorable to 
	integration.<a name="_ednref122" title href="#_edn122"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[122]</span></a>

	Despite good intentions and a fair amount of listings, this service did not 
	achieve much success.<a name="_ednref124" title href="#_edn124"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[124]</span></a> 
	Of four listed houses in white neighborhoods that were open for sale to

	CFRE did not try to determine why no people of color volunteered to buy 
	these houses.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE recognized that 
	much of the resistance by homeowners and their neighbors to sell to people 
	of color was due to the fear of lowered property values resulting from a 
	person of color moved into the neighborhood. Consequently, CFRE sought to 
	educate homeowners to dispel this myth. The educational effort went 
	hand&#8209;in&#8209;hand with their push to integrate neighborhoods.<a name="_ednref126" title href="#_edn126"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[126]</span></a> 
	Another part of this plan was to encourage supporters of open housing who 
	saw &quot;for sale&quot; signs in their neighborhood to talk with the seller and let 
	the seller know that new neighbors were welcomed regardless of race, creed 
	or national origin.<a name="_ednref127" title href="#_edn127"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[127]</span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In June of 1965, the 
	Seattle Real Estate Board announced, on its own, a policy of 
	non&#8209;discrimination. This policy followed the Washington State Board of 
	Realtors voluntary code.<a name="_ednref139" title href="#_edn139"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[139]</span></a> 
	At last, in 1968, the Seattle City Council passed an open housing policy.<a name="_ednref140" title href="#_edn140"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[140]</span></a> 
	The unanimous passage of this policy was remarkable given the rocky history 
	of open housing in Seattle but the decision came twenty years after 
	restrictive covenants had been declared legally unenforceable. In this case, 
	Seattle had lost its status as a civil rights leader. The measure came after 
	voluntary integration had already made in&#8209;roads against segregation.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE's work to end 
	cemetery restrictions seems somewhat unimportant in the larger scheme of 
	civil rights work and CFRE's methods for creating neighborhood integration 
	seem to lose effectiveness over time. True, CFRE's efforts helped to end 
	racial restrictions in cemeteries and housing, but what about all of the 
	other issues at hand like achieving equality in employment, education and 
	personal treatment? Did CFRE shy away from these larger issues because they 
	were not up to the fight or did they believe that other groups could work 
	more effectively on these issues because of their legal and direct action 
	methods? The work of the Christian Friends towards integrating Seattle's 
	neighborhoods shows that CFRE was not wholly removed from the larger civil 
	rights picture, but CFRE's drive to end segregation could only go as far as 
	their social methods would allow. Over time, the radical methods CFRE 
	employed in 1942 became less and less radical and gradually lost 
	effectiveness until by the sixties when legal and direct action strategies 
	were crucial to ending discrimination, CFRE was practically impotent. 
	Nevertheless, CFRE continued to see its educational, social and religious 
	approach as a special part of the larger civil rights picture, which was 
	&quot;linked at the fringes&quot; with the other civil rights groups' specific 
	objectives.<a name="_ednref141" title href="#_edn141"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[141]</span></a> 
	Because it was different, CFRE reasoned that its approach was necessary to 
	the civil rights movement.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The legislative tactics 
	CFRE chose to try to end cemetery and housing restrictions and to foster 
	neighborhood integration are at odds with its stated belief that &quot;though you 
	can legislate against discrimination, you can cure prejudice only by social 
	acquaintance.”<a name="_ednref142" title href="#_edn142"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[142]</span></a> 
	However, this belief did not deny the effectiveness of legislative 
	techniques or their necessity in certain areas. CFRE's increased focus on 
	legislative issues as time progressed shows that the Christian Friends tried 
	to respond to the new civil rights climate that emerged during the late 
	fifties and throughout the sixties, a climate that was increasingly 
	concerned with legal and direct action techniques. CFRE was not more active 
	in lobbying earlier because that is not what the civil rights climate called 
	for; there were few civil rights bills to lobby for until the mid&#8209;fifties. 
	The legislation of the fifties and sixties was the product of the education 
	and community activism of groups like CFRE during the forties. As this 
	legislation arose, CFRE had to adapt its group to a more legislative tone if 
	it was to have any place in the changing civil rights climate.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though the Christian 
	Friends tried to adapt and find its role in the new civil rights climate of 
	the sixties, this was extremely difficult for the group. By early spring 
	1966, the Christian Friends was in a state of crisis. The treasury was 
	drained, the board was faced with being &quot;almost entirely unable to persuade 
	members to accept responsibilities such as running committees or even being 
	on them&quot; and the organization was functioning without a president because no 
	one was willing to serve.<a name="_ednref143" title href="#_edn143"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[143]</span></a> 
	A meeting was held at Mt. Zion Baptist Church to determine if CFRE should 
	continue and if so, in what capacity. How had such a prominent and 
	successful organization become so weak? This change had not happened 
	suddenly; CFRE had been dealing with funding concerns and identity issues 
	for nearly fifteen years.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the spring of 1953, 
	Christian Friends for Racial Equality members began to question the 
	appropriateness of &quot;racial equality&quot; in the CFRE name. One argument against 
	&quot;racial equality&quot; was that the Christian Friends work for more than just 
	racial equality. Others felt that CFRE's long name was cumbersome and 
	limited their publicity in newspapers. However, after reviewing the issues, 
	the committee examining the issue decided that Christian Friends for Racial 
	Equality, though lengthy, was a name recognized by the public for its good 
	works and though the purpose of the group may have shifted since its 
	formation in 1942, the name should remain unchanged.<a name="_ednref144" title href="#_edn144"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[144]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It was during this same 
	time period (1952&#8209;1953), that CFRE started to notice a decline in social 
	gatherings, though attendance at meetings was high.<a name="_ednref145" title href="#_edn145"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[145]</span></a> 
	This phenomenon is part of a shift in the function of CFRE away from small 
	social acquaintance activities and towards more educational pursuits and 
	community activism work. Evidence of the shift included the new endeavors of 
	CFRE to hold booths at the Evergreen State Fair and at Seafair, to lobby for 
	civil rights legislation in Olympia and to educate the public on the civil 
	rights legislation after it had been passed. Though small social gatherings 
	virtually ended during this period, the large social events, like the CFRE 
	Annual Fun Fest, Annual Dinner Meeting and the Annual Picnic continued to 
	increase in attendance.<a name="_ednref146" title href="#_edn146"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[146]</span></a> 
	The shift is the product of an increasing membership that could not sustain 
	an intimate atmosphere. CFRE had to shift its endeavors to match its 
	membership. However, because the original niche of CFRE had been social 
	acquaintance and friendship, this shift would ultimately return to trouble 
	the organization in the form of identity and purpose confusion.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the April 1959 <u>
	Racial Equality Bulletin</u>, the article entitled, &quot;Look! I Haven't Seen 
	You for a Couple of Years!,&quot; remarked, &quot;we used to stand around the coffee 
	table and talk... you could hear delighted laughter and the making of dates 
	for lunch, or a sing in somebody's home, or maybe a leisurely evening with a 
	game.”<a name="_ednref147" title href="#_edn147"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[147]</span></a> 
	The article urged members to stop being &quot;too busy and important&quot; to attend 
	the meetings. This plea for the good old days when the Christian Friends 
	used to be pals and attend meetings because of the pleasure, not the duty, 
	signifies that CFRE was losing appeal. People weren't coming for either the 
	educational meetings or the social aspects; this article was a call to 
	recapture the original attraction of the Christian Friends. The article 
	continued, &quot;Those were the days when no one ever thought of the Christian 
	Friends' treasury being without money!”<a name="_ednref148" title href="#_edn148"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[148]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	Hand in hand with a drop in membership and attendance was the loss of funds, 
	a problem that would later reach desperate proportions.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">By 1962, CFRE was 
	re&#8209;examining its purpose in board meetings. Questions posed at the February 
	1962 board meeting included: &quot;Where is the CFRE going? What exactly are our 
	goals? Can we do our best work through the churches?&quot;<a name="_ednref149" title href="#_edn149"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[149]</span></a> 
	These questions illustrate that CFRE was no longer confidant in its basic 
	purpose, direction and work in Seattle churches. In order to reach a point 
	where such deep introspection takes place, CFRE must have felt that its

	Unfortunately, the direction that was chosen for CFRE's future was not 
	published in the <u>Bulletin</u>, but the subsequent actions of CFRE 
	indicate that the group progressed much like it had before.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Decreased contributions

	volunteers.<a name="_ednref151" title href="#_edn151"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[151]</span></a> 
	CFRE's financial trouble had become so great that at the January 1964 CFRE 
	meeting, members voted unanimously that henceforth membership would be on a 
	dues&#8209;paying basis. There were several levels of membership to fit different 
	budgets, but the original inclusive purpose of a non&#8209;dues organization,

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE president Reverend 
	Robert B. Shaw wrote &quot;An Urgent Call to Action by the New CFRE President,&quot; 
	for the January 1964 <u>Racial Equality Bulletin</u>. In this piece, he 
	noted that what was once bold action taken by CFRE in the early forties was 
	now taken for granted. He wanted the Christian Friends to once again adopt 
	an innovative an bold race relations program. At the same time, he still 
	believed that CFRE’s best work was through the social acquaintance method. 
	Thus, he proposed the interracial, interfaith home visitation project as a 
	way to “produce more interest in [CFRE] meetings and enlarge the number 
	attending.” He envisioned that home visits could revitalize CFRE and 
	possibly lead to “a whole range of new activities in the general field of 
	bringing people together, whether for serious or recreational purposes.”<a name="_ednref153" title href="#_edn153"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[153]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though three successful 
	home visit days were organized, it was not enough to restore CFRE membership 
	and revitalize the organization. In the President’s Report of 1965, Shaw 
	reported that the future of home visits was uncertain and CFRE would 
	probably not sponsor any more. He noted that attendance was meager at 
	meetings and “small gatherings resulted in a loss of interracial character 
	[that] detracted from the purpose” (though he did not state in what manner). 
	He also cited problems in finding volunteers for committee work, which was a 
	large problem because the goal of CFRE was to have all members be “crew 
	members and not just passengers.” Finally, he emphasized the difficult task 
	of the CFRE board to re-examine its role in Seattle race relations, noting 
	that it is possible that “the racial equality struggle here has gone beyond 
	the present [CFRE] Statement of Purpose.”<a name="_ednref154" title href="#_edn154"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[154]</span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At the January 1966 
	board meeting, it was decided to put the continuation of CFRE up to a vote 
	at the March 16 meeting.<a name="_ednref155" title href="#_edn155"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[155]</span></a> 
	A February potluck let members meet to discuss both sides of the issue. Many 
	felt that CFRE had been a pioneer in Seattle race relations for almost 25 
	years, but that now other organizations were doing the same work Edith 
	Steinmetz, CFRE founder, announced that she would accept either decision 
	equally.<a name="_ednref156" title href="#_edn156"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[156]</span></a> 
	The March 7th letter mailed by Alice B. Nugent, on behalf of the CFRE board, 
	stated the arguments for both the dissolution of CFRE and for the 
	continuation of CFRE in a modified form.<a name="_ednref157" title href="#_edn157"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[157]</span></a> 
	Both sides were presented at the March 13, 1966 meeting that had a 
	surprisingly small number of attendees. It was unanimously decided to give 
	up the CFRE office. Twelve members voted to disband the Christian Friends 
	and fourteen voted to continue CFRE and to accept the offer of NAACP 
	president June Smith to provide CFRE with desk space at the NAACP office. 
	After the decision was made to continue CFRE, Joan Hiltner and Ross Burks 
	signed up to coordinate the organization while fourteen others signed up for 
	committee work.<a name="_ednref158" title href="#_edn158"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[158]</span></a> 
	In May, the new CFRE program coordinators and several board members met and 
	agreed to continue to operate CFRE under the original constitution and 
	by&#8209;laws; membership dues were eliminated. Eight members of the board agreed 
	to continue to serve and five declined.<a name="_ednref159" title href="#_edn159"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[159]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	had chosen to continue with their original principles of education and 
	social interaction despite a completely different civil rights climate in 
	1966 than in 1942. Once again a small group of about thirty members, CFRE 
	was free to engage in the social acquaintance environment of old. Small 
	gatherings and picnics were the norm. Educational meetings were organized in 
	conjunction with other civil rights groups and events were supported by 
	CFRE, but organized by other groups. CFRE did continue the Annual Picnic, 
	Annual Membership Dinner and the Annual February Potluck Dinner. The <u>
	Racial Equality Bulletin </u>was retired sometime in late 1968 and replaced 
	by a small newsletter.<a name="_ednref160" title href="#_edn160"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[160]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">During the years after 
	CFRE's re&#8209;birth, the Christian Friends sought to regain a place in the new 
	civil rights struggle. CFRE envisioned the revival of home visits, they 
	wanted to increase scholarship money for African American students and 
	wanted to assist with finding homes for infants of color by supporting the 
	Medina Children's Service that had the backing of Edith Steinmetz.<a name="_ednref161" title href="#_edn161"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[161]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CFRE also dealt with the 
	changing civil rights climate by holding meetings that addressed the issue 
	of a new black militancy. At CFRE's twenty&#8209;fourth annual dinner meeting in 
	May 1966, the primary speaker was Carl Miller, the president of the Seattle 
	Chapter of the Student Non&#8209;Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). His speech 
	was entitled, &quot;Black Militancy, One Side of the Coin.&quot; In the December 1966
	<u>Racial Equality Bulletin </u>CFRE again tried to formulate its assessment 
	of Black Power.<a name="_ednref162" title href="#_edn162"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[162]</span></a> 
	The <u>REB </u>carried the <u>Southern Patriot</u> article &quot;Anatomy of a 
	Black Panther: What They're Saying in Loundes County, Alabama.&quot; In this 
	article, the black panther was portrayed as a symbol fighting, &quot;not with 
	fists, but... for power&quot; and Black Power was defined as &quot;not to take over, 
	but to share.&quot; This article presented CFRE members with a positive, mostly 
	non&#8209;threatening image of Black Power ideology and the new direction of civil 
	rights. By this time, the civil rights struggle and ideology was very much 
	beyond simple social acquaintance and integration Therefore, in order for 
	CFRE to be effective in the civil rights climate of the late sixties and 
	early seventies, it would have had to practice direct action, not just 
	accept it as legitimate for others.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Throughout 1970, the 
	last year of CFRE records, the group had planned social and educational 
	meetings as well as the annual potluck and the annual dinner meeting.<a name="_ednref163" title href="#_edn163"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[163]</span></a> 
	It is most probably the case that CFRE records disappeared because the 
	person whose sources were used discontinued membership and not because CFRE 
	disbanded. In any case, the exact end of the Christian Friends is unknown.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Charting the identity 
	crisis of CFRE from 1952 through 1966 and even into 1970, it can be seen 
	that the Christian Friends was trying to find its place amidst an 
	ever-changing civil rights climate. When the civil rights struggle began to 
	be more publicized in the mid&#8209;fifties, CFRE noted a decline in the 
	attendance of social gatherings, but an increase in attendance at 
	educational sessions. Though it had earlier sworn off legal methods, by the 
	mid&#8209;fifties, CFRE advocated legal action to end cemetery discrimination and 
	housing restrictions, CFRE's legal action coincides with the time when legal 
	means towards ending discrimination began to be increasingly successful and 
	necessary in the Civil Rights Movement. Nevertheless, CFRE could not adjust 
	itself to the direct action methods demanded by the civil rights struggle in 
	the late&#8209;fifties and sixties, even though this method was recognized by CFRE 
	as being the only way that &quot;prejudices and practices obstructing racial 
	equality [could] be effectively brought to the attention of those engaging 
	in, or responsible for, segregation and discrimination.”<a name="_ednref164" title href="#_edn164"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[164]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite the fact that 
	CFRE methods remained largely the same throughout its lifespan, its place in 
	the civil rights struggle changed because CFRE did not evolve its practices 
	in accordance to the evolving struggle. The once pioneering social 
	interaction and educational plan of CFRE that first brought attention to the 
	housing concerns of the colored people of Seattle had become ineffectual as 
	the civil rights struggle moved towards ending legal and de&#8209;facto 
	segregation through direct action demonstrations and legal challenges. In 
	1964, CFRE President Rev. Robert B. Shaw wrote that CFRE was once a pioneer 
	in Seattle race relations because a program of &quot;interracial communication... 
	was quite remarkable.&quot; However, he continued, &quot;today [interracial 
	communication] is taken for granted. What was bold twenty years ago is 
	widely accepted today.&quot; He urged CFRE to again be a pioneer in race 
	relations by adopting a demonstrative strategy, but CFRE membership was not 
	ready to change its methods.<a name="_ednref165" title href="#_edn165"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[165]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:36.75pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Though CFRE found it 
	difficult to adjust to the changing civil rights climate, it did impact 
	Seattle race relations, especially during the earlier part of its 
	organization. The exact nature of this impact is difficult to judge because 
	CFRE rarely left evaluative records of its programs and because other civil 
	rights groups were also working on many of the same issues as the Christian 
	Friends. Much of CFRE work during the latter half of its organization seemed 
	to create more of an ameliorative effect rather than that leading to a 
	direct social change.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:36.75pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It is possible to 
	estimate CFRE's impact by examining the movements started by the group and 
	the people who the group influenced. The Christian Friends was among the 
	very first to begin to work for fair housing in Seattle, bringing this issue 
	to the attention of the general public as early as 1944, twenty&#8209;four years 
	before fair&#8209;housing legislation was passed in Washington. The work of CFRE 
	on housing influenced and encouraged many other groups to join them in the 
	effort. CFRE was also a pioneer in ending cemetery restrictions, beginning 
	this work in 1945. CFRE foresight and motivation contributed to the creation 
	of Seattle's Civic Unity Committee, a very effective public organ that 
	worked to improve civil rights.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:36.75pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In another manner, 
	CFRE impacted the community through the actions of its members. CFRE members 
	strove to create a positive environment for interracial and inter&#8209;religious 
	exchange by talking with their neighbors and co&#8209;workers. Many CFRE members 
	also held positions of community influence. These members could have 
	integrated the CFRE philosophy into their own influential statements and 
	thus extended CFRE influence further.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:36.75pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Ironically, one area 
	that the Christian Friends was most likely unable to be influential in was 
	the ending of prejudice in individuals. Though this was the primary 
	objective of CFRE, to be accomplished through social interaction, most of 
	the people who came to CFRE meetings and participated in CFRE educational 
	programs were already convinced that all people were created equal and 
	should be treated as such. CFRE could not directly influence prejudiced 
	minds because these people tended to stay away from the Christian Friends. 
	This was the major problem associated with the interracial home visit 
	program. Reverend Robert B. Shaw notes the limitations of the program as 
	being: &quot;many participants were already unprejudiced and too few new people 
	participated.”<a name="_ednref166" title href="#_edn166"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:normal; font-family: Arial">[166]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	This dilemma seemed to be the case with many CFRE programs.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:36.75pt;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian Friends 
	for Racial Equality is an interesting organization to study because of its 
	membership and because of its pioneering work in Seattle race and religious 
	relations. Civil rights groups composed of two&#8209;thirds women are very rare. 
	Though women have been active in many social welfare causes throughout the 
	civil rights movement, they have seldom enjoyed the leadership positions and 
	credit that should accompany their dedication. In the Christian Friends, 
	women served in 72% of the leadership positions and represented CFRE to the 
	community. Seattle's acceptance of the predominately female civil rights 
	group helped to create an environment for female participation in Seattle's 
	social justice groups of the seventies and on into the future.</span></p>
	<p class="OmniPage1" style="text-indent:36.75pt;line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Founded in 1942, the 
	group enjoyed ten years as a pioneer in Seattle race relations, introducing 
	the concern of restrictive covenants to Seattle's civil rights struggle and 
	motivating Seattle's churches to become community leaders fighting for 
	integration and equality. Though CFRE adopted some legal means of fighting 
	discrimination, the groups' insistence to continue to focus on social 
	interaction as the primary method to ending prejudice limited their impact 
	and influence as the Civil Rights Movement shifted towards direct action and 
	legal challenges. As a result of their resistance to change, the Christian 
	Friends went from being Seattle's largest interracial organization in the 
	mid-fifties to a group of fourteen members who voted to continue the 
	organization in March 1966. Despite the ineffectiveness that encompassed the 
	organization during its latter years, the Christian Friends must be 
	remembered and recognized for its early contributions to Seattle race and 
	religious relations, primarily in the area of housing, but also in community 
	education. Groups such as the Christian Friends should be acknowledged as 
	the necessary forerunners to the legal and direct action organizations of 
	the late&#8209;fifties and sixties. The Christian Friends helped to lay the 
	foundation for later change through their work in community education and by 
	working with the local government, churches and the business community to 
	make positive race and religious relations a community priority.</span></p>

			CFRE did not believe the argument of cemetery owners who said that 
			they must maintain the restrictions or else they would be sued for 
			breech of contract. The supposed grounds for the suit would be that 
			the cemeteries had made contracts with the buyers of the burial 
			plots that stated that the cemetery was for “Caucasians only.” If 
			the cemeteries allowed other races in, they argued that they would 
			be breaking the contracts. CFRE believed that if the Supreme Court 
			deemed restrictive covenants unenforceable, then the ruling should 
			apply to cemeteries as well. Chester Kingsbury papers, University of
