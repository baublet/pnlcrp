      <p class="arial10 ">Seattle has a long history of racial discrimination and segregation. Until the late 1960s, 
African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans were shut out of most neighborhoods, schools, many occupations, and sometimes stores and restaurants. This slide show explores Seattle segregation using maps, documents, photographs, and video oral history excerpts. It clarifies the distinction between segregation as practiced in southern states and Seattle's version. And it reveals  shocking facts about hospitals that would not treat patients of color, stores that would not serve African Americans or Asian Americans, and real estate firms that organized neighborhoods to keep them segregated. </FONT></p>

      <p class="arial10">The Black Panther Party made a major impact on Seattle. With their black berets, leather jackets, and commitment to armed self defense, the Panthers became role models to some, scared others. Either way, the organization showed Seattle that struggles for racial justice had moved beyond persuasion and nonviolent protest. This slide show introduces the special section on Seattle's Black Panther Party. In videotaped oral history segments, former Panthers talk about their reasons for joining the Party and their experiences in the organization. Former mayor Wes Uhlman tells of FBI plans to raid Panther headquarters and his reasons for intervening to prevent bloodshed. The slide show begins by establishing the background of segregation facing African Americans in Seattle. Also included are key Panther documents and riveting photographs.</FONT></p>

      <p class="arial10"> Seattle&rsquo;s female civil rights activists have unique stories. As people of color, they battled racial discrimination. As women, they battled sex discrimination. The intersection of these two fights sometimes pitted women of color against those who should have been allies. This slide show explores female activists&rsquo; particular experiences in Seattle&rsquo;s civil rights movements. It features video oral history excerpts from interviews with female activists from different civil rights movements.</p>
