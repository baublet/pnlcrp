	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don’t shop downtown now! Return your charge card now! Shop in 
	other areas now!” urged leaflets distributed by the Seattle chapter of the 
	Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), in regards to a boycott fighting

	Numerous stores in Seattle such as Nordstrom, Bon Marche, Safeway, and J.C. 
	Penny refused to hire black workers in the early 1960s. The situation in 
	Seattle was a microcosm of the widespread job discrimination against African 
	Americans throughout the entire United States.&nbsp; The civil rights movement 
	saw the formation of various civil rights groups that held demonstrations 
	and carried out campaigns protesting the lack of equal rights for African 
	Americans.&nbsp; While some operations were extremely successful and others had a 
	limited impact, the actions taken by civil rights activists exposed the 
	blatant discrimination by whites against minority groups.&nbsp; This essay looks 
	at one of the campaigns undertaken by the Seattle chapter of CORE in an 
	effort to gain more jobs for African Americans in the downtown retail core 
	of the city.&nbsp; The project, called the Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown 
	Seattle (DEEDS), was one of the most extensive and challenging campaigns 
	ever taken on by CORE, and while the results fell short of expectations, 
	DEEDS opened the eyes of many Seattleites to the crucial issue of employment 
	discrimination. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">In 
	the spring of 1942, CORE, a civil rights organization dedicated to gaining 
	equality for African Americans through the use of nonviolent means, was 
	established in Chicago.&nbsp; Of the six founding members of CORE, four were 
	divinity students and two were liberal arts students; all had been engaged 
	in the Christian-pacifist movement of the 1930s.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	According to historians August Meier and Elliot Rudwick, members of CORE 
	“were required to be well versed in the principles of nonviolent philosophy, 
	to be active in some phase of CORE’s work, and to accept the ‘Action 
	Discipline’ which set forth the modified Gandhian methods by which CORE 
	operated.&nbsp; Commitment and dedication were deemed more important than size.”<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	A focus on democracy, one of the main tenets of CORE’s philosophy, played an 
	important role in the operation of the organization, as elections took place 
	every two or three months. The leaders of CORE strongly emphasized 
	nonviolence, and the Action Discipline stated that a peaceful approach 
	“confronts justice without fear, without compromise, and without hate … it 
	is suicidal for a minority group to use violence, since to use it would 
	simply result in complete control and subjugation by the majority group.”<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Interracialism was another important aspect of CORE's ideology. The group 
	saw discrimination against African Americans not as a racial problem but as 
	“a human problem which could be eliminated only through the joint efforts of 
	all believers in the brotherhood of man.”<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Using this philosophy, in its first year of operation, Chicago CORE 
	successfully fought discrimination at a roller-skating rink, a barbershop, 
	the University of Chicago, and at restaurants throughout the city.&nbsp; Other 
	CORE chapters throughout the country began to form, and by 1947 thirteen 
	branches, located primarily in the Midwest, had been established.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The majority of CORE members, both blacks and whites, were young, educated 
	men and women from middle-class families.&nbsp; In the 1940s, CORE chapters 
	achieved modest successes in restaurants and areas of recreation, but 
	negotiations in the school and housing sectors generally failed.&nbsp; Despite 
	these early disappointments, CORE continued to increase in members and 
	chapters throughout the country and many campaigns fighting discrimination 
	gained momentum. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">The 
	1960s saw significant improvements in the tactics used by CORE as well as 
	their members’ level of participation and influence within the civil rights 
	movement.&nbsp; The largest and most successful campaign undertaken by CORE was 
	the Freedom Rides of 1961 in which men and women challenged segregation on 
	interstate buses, bus terminals, and in all-white dining rooms throughout 
	the South. The impact of the Freedom Rides was felt throughout the United 
	States. As Meier and Rudwick argue, it “not only had a momentous impact on 
	the patterns of southern segregation; it also exerted an influence 
	impossible to exaggerate upon the civil rights movement itself.”<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Following this major CORE campaign, many of the smaller chapters were 
	inspired to take on further non-violent action against discrimination in 
	housing, education, and employment.&nbsp; The national office offered chapter 
	leaders training and workshops in order to provide experience and knowledge 
	in how to organize local campaigns.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	More CORE chapters continued to form, and as of 1961 there were 53 active 
	chapters—one of which was located in Seattle, Washington. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	Despite not being established until twenty years after CORE was founded, the 
	Seattle CORE chapter quickly gained high levels of participation and 
	undertook many significant and influential projects in the 1960s.&nbsp; Joan and 
	Ed Singler, two of the founding members of the Seattle CORE branch, saw the 
	CORE Freedom Rides on television and were inspired to join the movement 
	against&nbsp; segregation.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Formed in July of 1961 with approximately thirty active members, Seattle 
	CORE was evenly integrated, with about half African Americans and half 
	whites. In order to be an official member, individuals had to attend an 
	orientation, commit to non-violence, and participate in role-playing 
	sessions as well as actual demonstrations.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
	<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[10]</span></a></span>&nbsp; 
	Seattle CORE’s first major operation in 1961 involved “selective buying 
	campaigns,” which targeted employment discrimination in businesses such the 
	Bon Marche, J.C. Penny, Nordstrom, Frederick and Nelson, and the A&amp;P Grocery 
	chain.&nbsp; CORE's tactics involved picketing and “shop-ins,” in which 
	protestors filled shopping carts with merchandise and once the cashier had 
	rung up the items, left the store without paying.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	These protests resulted in the hiring of a small number of African Americans 
	at local department stores and supermarkets by the end of 1963.&nbsp; Seattle 
	CORE launched a second campaign in 1963 focused on housing discrimination, 
	as members tried to expose the racism in the Seattle housing market.&nbsp; One 
	tactic involved over 200 people picketing at the Washington Real Estate 
	Board during a three-day period.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	For many members of CORE, the organization was a way of life in the early 
	1960s. As Joan Singler recalled, “every part of our life was totally 
	committed to doing CORE activities.”<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	CORE members spent endless hours together planning protests and 
	demonstrations, researching, fundraising, training, and even cooking.&nbsp; The 
	enormous amount of time and dedication put in by the activists was reflected 
	in the continual growth of the Seattle chapter as well as in the increased 
	number of campaigns targeted at ending racial discrimination. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">As of 
	May 1964, the Seattle CORE branch had 139 active members in addition to a 
	variety of elected leaders.&nbsp; Walt Hundley, one of the chairmen of the 
	chapter, held a master’s degree in social work from the University of 
	Washington.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[14]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Born in Philadelphia, Hundley moved to Seattle in 1954 to work as a minister 
	at the Church of the People and after several years became involved in 
	social work.&nbsp; Not only did Hundley preside as chair of Seattle CORE 
	beginning in November of 1964; he was also a member of the Central Area 
	Civil Rights Committee and organized numerous demonstrations throughout 
	Seattle.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[15]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Charles and Bettylou Valentine were also extremely active members of Seattle 
	CORE and helped promote and research various projects undertaken by the 
	organization.&nbsp; Charles, a professor of anthropology at the University of 
	Washington, wrote two extensive studies regarding the segregation of African 
	Americans in Seattle.&nbsp; His wife, Bettylou, a graduate student at UW, 
	volunteered as the secretary for Seattle CORE and recorded the minutes for 
	weekly meetings.&nbsp; While she wanted to eventually become the chair, women 
	were discouraged from running for president and instead headed smaller 
	committees; Joan Singler chaired the housing committee, and Jean Adams ran 
	the negotiating committee.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[16]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">In 
	the summer of 1964, Seattle CORE undertook a major campaign in downtown 
	Seattle with the goal of attaining over a thousand well-paying jobs for 
	African Americans.&nbsp; Over the years, despite numerous negotiations with 
	various businesses attempting to put an end to employment discrimination, 
	only a small number of blacks had been hired for white-collar jobs.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	While they had made modest gains, members of CORE wanted to see a more 
	notable change in the hiring practices of retail stores, restaurants, and 
	offices throughout downtown Seattle.&nbsp; On a national level, Congress had 
	passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned employment discrimination 
	in the United States. Specifically, Title VII made it unlawful for an 
	employer “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual … because 
	of such an individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[18]</span></span></a> 
	Therefore, in theory, companies and organizations in Seattle should have 
	been hiring an increased number of African Americans; however, in reality, 
	the Civil Rights Act did not generate many immediate changes.&nbsp; At a weekend 
	seminar held by CORE in May of 1964, members addressed the difficulties in 
	achieving success in the realm of employment discrimination and made various 
	suggestions about how to overcome these obstacles.&nbsp; In past campaigns CORE 
	had usually dealt with one employer at a time instead of approaching a large 
	number of companies at once, which members recognized as a significant 
	problem.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	During a CORE membership meeting on June 9, 1964, Walt Hundley announced a 
	proposal to create a campaign against employment discrimination that 
	involved a widespread boycott of the entire downtown area.&nbsp; Following a 
	great deal of discussion, Hundley made a motion that CORE establish “a 
	project committee to investigate the idea of a downtown boycott with no 
	action to be taken without a definite mandate from the membership and that 
	the investigation include at least surveying of Central Area interest, a 
	survey of downtown businesses, and mobilization of Negro, white and other 
	organizational support.”<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[20]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Hundley’s motion passed with thirty-six votes in support, none opposed, and 
	two abstentions, and a team was established to perform surveys and research 
	regarding demographics and employment practices in downtown Seattle. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">A 
	committee of approximately thirty CORE members completed a substantial 
	amount of research in June and July of 1964 in order to generate a solid 
	basis of information on which a boycott of downtown Seattle could be 
	enacted.&nbsp; The volunteer study team – made up of social scientists, 
	university students, high school students, housewives and skilled downtown 
	employees – and led by Charles Valentine, included both African American and 
	white members.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[21]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The primary purpose of the study was to learn about the role of African 
	Americans as downtown consumers, the availability of jobs in the downtown 
	area, and the feasibility of increasing the number of African Americans in 
	the work force without the displacement of any current employees.&nbsp; As there 
	was no existing data regarding employment practices in the 1960s in Seattle, 
	CORE had to directly collect most of its information.&nbsp; The CORE committee 
	primarily approached the study by conducting extensive surveys in the 
	downtown area. Twenty-four individuals conducted the surveys in four phases 
	during the summer months of 1964.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
	<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[22]</span></a></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The first phase was the retail employment survey, which involved recording 
	the ethnicity of all observable employees in the twenty square blocks of the 
	most intensive retail core of the downtown area.&nbsp; Over 200 businesses with 
	1,300 employees were surveyed, with the majority being department stores, 
	apparel shops, drug stores, hardware stores, restaurants, and hotels.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[23]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The second phase involved a survey of private offices in eight major office 
	buildings located between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Avenues and Pike 
	and Jefferson Streets; information on a total of 9,000 employees was 
	recorded.<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The third phase was a survey of all downtown government workers, including 
	those in the federal, state, county and municipal offices.&nbsp; Surveys in the 
	Federal Courthouse, Federal Office Building, King County Courthouse, 
	Municipal and Public Safety Buildings, and City Light counted 3,650 
	government employees.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[25]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Finally, the fourth phase included a customer survey of all retail stores, 
	which involved observing customer entrances and recording the ethnicity of 
	each shopper as &quot;white,&quot; &quot;Negro,&quot; or &quot;nonwhite.&quot;&nbsp; The members of the CORE 
	team performed the surveys in one to three hour time blocks, usually during 
	heavy shopping periods. In all, 6,650 customers were observed and recorded.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	While the committee was unable to survey every business or office in the 
	downtown area, they were able to cover between 25 and 50 percent of all 
	employees.&nbsp; The study team consulted various professional statisticians, 
	demographers, and economists at the University of Washington in order to 
	make more productive use of the information they obtained.&nbsp; One major 
	problem the members of the CORE team noticed during the downtown surveys was 
	that a majority of African American workers were employed in menial 
	positions hidden from the public eye, such as night janitors or 
	dishwashers.&nbsp; Consequently, the surveyors found it difficult to accurately 
	determine the number of African Americans employed in downtown Seattle.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[27]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Despite this setback, the Seattle CORE committee was able to collect a 
	significant amount of data that proved to be extremely useful in 
	understanding the widespread employment discrimination problem in the 
	downtown area. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">The 
	statistics and information compiled by the CORE study team revealed a 
	significant under-representation of African Americans employed in downtown 
	Seattle in comparison with the number of African Americans living in the 
	city.&nbsp; At the time of the study, 28,000 African Americans lived in Seattle, 
	which accounted for 5 percent of the total population; 75 percent of 
	Seattle’s blacks lived in nine census tracts in the Central Area.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[28]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The CORE surveys revealed that while African Americans were 5 percent of the 
	city’s population and made up 5 percent of downtown retail consumers, they 
	held less than 3.5 percent of downtown jobs.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[29]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Of the 55,000 jobs provided by private employers downtown, African Americans 
	held only 1,600 (less than 3 percent). What is more, a majority of the 
	positions African Americans did hold were as janitors, hotel maids, kitchen 
	workers, night maintenance employees, and other less desirable, unskilled, 
	and poorly paid occupations.<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[30]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In the downtown retail sector, less than 2 percent of all jobs were held by 
	African Americans and, of those positions, less than a third were sales jobs 
	and only 10 percent were in an office.<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[31]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The statistics in the clerical and general office sector in downtown Seattle 
	exposed even greater employment discrimination: of the 9,000 jobs in 
	ordinary office buildings, only 18 African Americans were observed, which is 
	0.2 percent of the total positions.<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[32]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	When the CORE team surveyed 2,000 restaurant workers in 65 establishments, 
	they did not find a single African American working as a manager, hostess, 
	cashier, or even waitress, but they observed that every restaurant had an 
	African American janitor.<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[33]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The under representation continued: only 1 percent of jobs at banks and real 
	estate offices and less than 1 percent of jobs in municipal government were 
	held by African Americans. Only three African Americans were observed among 
	the 550 employees at the King County Courthouse.<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[34]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In terms of customers, the committee found that African Americans made up 12 
	percent of shoppers in retail stores, which they determined was most likely 
	due to the close proximity of the Central Area to downtown Seattle along 
	with the lack of stores in the Central Area.<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[35]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The study also estimated that African Americans controlled 4 percent of the 
	total purchasing power and spent between $12 and $26 million per year in 
	downtown Seattle.<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[36]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In addition, CORE found that in the month of June 1964, the turnover rate of 
	jobs was 0.7 percent of the total work force, which included 251 new hires 
	in the retail and financial business sectors.<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[37]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	When these numbers were applied to the entire downtown area, the CORE team 
	determined that downtown employers would make a minimum of 5,350 new hires 
	over the next year, which averaged out to about 450 people added to the 
	payrolls each month.<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[38]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	With all these statistics exposing the significant employment discrimination 
	problems faced by African Americans in downtown Seattle amid the continual 
	opening of new jobs, the Seattle CORE branch decided to charge ahead with 
	the planned boycott of the entire downtown area. </span></p>

	these goals were not intended as strict demands to fill racial quotas, they 
	provided CORE members with an overall objective to strive towards in the 
	latter half of 1964. The DEEDS program was broadcast at various times and 
	locations in letters, posters, and leaflets throughout the city of Seattle, 
	laying the groundwork for one of the most ambitious employment campaigns 
	ever carried out by a CORE chapter.<a name="_ednref41" title href="#_edn41"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[41]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">In 
	August of 1964 the first major step of the DEEDS campaign began, which 
	involved negotiations between representatives of downtown employers and 
	members of&nbsp; CORE.&nbsp; Both public and private employers, representing a large 
	area of downtown Seattle, attended the negotiations.&nbsp; The first meeting took 
	place on August 3, 1964, at which representatives of DEEDS requested that 
	employers take a census of present and prospective job openings and asked 
	for suggestions on how to effectively reach their employment goals.<a name="_ednref42" title href="#_edn42"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[42]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Tim Martin, the current chairman, and Charles Valentine spoke on behalf of 
	CORE, John Adams represented the Central Area Coordinating Committee on 
	Civil Rights, and Charles Johnson spoke for the NAACP.&nbsp; During the 
	negotiations, only the spokesmen for the federal government and Seattle 
	Mayor J.D. Braman expressed a willingness to hire more African American 
	workers; no other employer agreed to discuss the goals of DEEDS.<a name="_ednref43" title href="#_edn43"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[43]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Following the first meeting, Seattle CORE mailed another letter to downtown 
	businesses threatening direct action if no workable plan was implemented by 
	the first of September.&nbsp; The letter stated that no real conclusions were 
	reached in the first round of negotiations and requested that 
	representatives of downtown employers come to the next meeting on August 17<sup>th</sup> 
	with “a concrete proposal describing how the existing plan can be 
	implemented in his branch of government or sector of industry.”<a name="_ednref44" title href="#_edn44"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[44]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	A list of cooperating organizations was contained in the letter, which 
	included CORE, the Central Area Coordinating Committee for Civil Rights, the 
	Seattle NAACP, the Baptists Ministers Alliance, the Federation of Negro 
	Women’s Clubs, the Central Area Community Council, and the Greater Seattle 
	Council of Churches.&nbsp; Several weeks of negotiations followed without any 
	significant proposals by downtown employers to hire more African Americans; 
	thus, the second phase, that of appealing to broad public support and 
	implementing direct action, began. </span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DEEDS campaign was not Seattle CORE’s only project as of 
	August 1964, and in fact CORE was working on a variety of other activities 
	throughout the duration of DEEDS.&nbsp; In the latter half of 1964, CORE 
	prioritized four main issues: employment, education, housing, and 
	fundraising.&nbsp; In the employment sector, not only did CORE members put a 
	tremendous amount of effort into the DEEDS project, but they also continued 
	employment negotiations with a wide variety of companies, unrelated to DEEDS 
	activities.&nbsp; These businesses included Darigold, Carnation, A&amp;P, Safeway, 
	Wonderbread, J.C. Pennys, Rhodes, Bon Marche, Frederick &amp; Nelson, Nordstrom, 
	Washington Natural Gas, and Greyhound.<a name="_ednref45" title href="#_edn45"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[45]</span></span></a> 
	Focusing on education discrimination, CORE was in the process of presenting 
	short-term and long-term plans for integrating local schools.&nbsp; Housing was 
	another important area for CORE activists, and during August 1964 CORE 
	carried out an “intensive investigation into possibilities for a rent strike 
	against slum conditions in some parts of the Central District.”<a name="_ednref46" title href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[46]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Finally, CORE put on various fundraisers such as a CORE dance to earn money 
	for community education.&nbsp; Overall, CORE was an extremely active and 
	efficient organization that was able to manage numerous activities at once 
	and to effectively fight racial discrimination in different fields.&nbsp; While 
	Seattle CORE members had many projects to handle in 1964, none required as 
	much manpower as DEEDS, which was quickly developing into a significant and 
	extensive campaign.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step of reaching out for public support of the DEEDS 
	campaign involved spreading the news about the project to local communities 
	and informing people about how they could get involved.&nbsp; On August 26, 1964, 
	Tim Martin sent a letter to members of various Seattle civil rights groups 
	describing the DEEDS project and asking for cooperation from African 
	Americans as well as whites living in Seattle.&nbsp; This letter was the first 
	public announcement of DEEDS. It detailed the severe employment 
	discrimination in downtown Seattle and explained that African Americans held 
	only 2,200 of the 63,000 jobs in the downtown area.<a name="_ednref47" title href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[47]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Martin requested that individuals contribute to the campaign by informing 
	friends and organizations about the project, encouraging minorities to apply 
	for employment downtown, promoting fair hiring practices, and, if necessary, 
	engaging in non-violent direct action.&nbsp; Along with the mass mailing of the 
	CORE letter, members distributed approximately 15,000 leaflets explaining 
	the DEEDS campaign in the Central Area community in late August and early 
	September.<a name="_ednref48" title href="#_edn48"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[48]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	CORE activists also held local neighborhood meetings throughout the Central 
	Area to inform people about DEEDS.&nbsp; At a CORE membership meeting on 
	September 8, 1964, members decided by a vote to discontinue negotiations 
	with individual downtown employers and instead focus entirely on the direct 
	action campaign.<a name="_ednref49" title href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[49]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Local support for the DEEDS campaign grew as a result of the letters, 
	leaflets, and meetings, and the framework for a boycott of the entire 
	downtown area began to take shape. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October 1964 witnessed the launch of the direct action phase of 
	the DEEDS campaign in the form of non-violent boycotting, leafleting, and 
	picketing.&nbsp; The first goal of the DEEDS project had been 300 jobs for 
	African Americans by September 1<sup>st</sup>. Yet as of the beginning of 
	October, no jobs had been offered to blacks.<a name="_ednref50" title href="#_edn50"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[50]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	A kickoff rally took place on October 4<sup>th</sup>, which marked the start 
	of the boycott of the entire downtown retail area.&nbsp; The rally occurred on a 
	Sunday at 1 p.m. and was held in the parking lot of the Mt. Zion Baptist 
	Church, a predominantly black church that had been the site of a visit by 
	Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. three years earlier.&nbsp; Members of CORE wanted 
	this rally to be “a public witness of our commitment to civil rights,” and 
	the rally was sponsored not only by CORE but also groups such as the NAACP, 
	Catholic Interracial Council, Unitarians for Social Justice, Baptist 
	Ministers Alliance, Seattle Urban League, and the Greater Seattle Council of 
	Churches.<a name="_ednref51" title href="#_edn51"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[51]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The boycott targeted all businesses in downtown Seattle, including 
	department stores, smaller retail shops, restaurants, and movie theaters.&nbsp; 
	CORE decided to implement the boycott during the holidays, the busiest 
	shopping period of the year, in order to create the largest impact on the 
	sales of the hundreds of downtown businesses, many of which depended on high 
	revenues at the end of the year in order to make their yearly profits.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	Various CORE chapters throughout the country used the tactic of a boycott as 
	a primary method of non-violent protest.&nbsp; Following the end of Great 
	Depression, American business began to flourish, fueled by the public's&nbsp; 
	powerful new role as consumers; consequently, as Kathy M. Newman writes, 
	“the new promise of mass consumption made the civil rights boycott a more 
	effective tool in the fight against discrimination.”<a name="_ednref52" title href="#_edn52"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[52]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	One of the first instances of boycotting took place in the 1930s when 
	African Americans implemented “Don’t Shop Where You Can’t Work” campaigns in 
	cities such as Harlem, Baltimore, and Los Angeles.&nbsp; These protests called 
	for African Americans to decline to shop in businesses that refused to 
	employ blacks as a way to peacefully urge companies to change their hiring 
	practices.&nbsp; One of the most famous civil rights actions, the Montgomery bus 
	boycott of 1955, involved African Americans refusing to ride the city buses 
	for over a year and eventually achieved the desegregation of public 
	transportation in Montgomery.&nbsp; Inspired by the success in Alabama, members 
	of CORE employed numerous boycotts to fight widespread employment 
	discrimination across the country.&nbsp; In Omaha, Nebraska, a CORE chapter 
	boycotted a local Coca-Cola plant for six weeks in 1951 and gained several 
	jobs for African Americans; several years later, the same branch boycotted 
	an ice cream parlor, which resulted in the hiring of a black saleswoman.<a name="_ednref53" title href="#_edn53"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[53]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The Los Angeles CORE implemented a boycott of a beer company in 1961 and 
	1962, gaining jobs for three black salesmen.&nbsp; Similar successful boycotts 
	took place in cities such as Berkeley, Washington D.C., and Boston, 
	reflecting the substantial influence a boycott can have on the practices of 
	businesses.&nbsp; As the majority of the CORE boycotts were limited in their 
	scope and size, the Seattle CORE’s DEEDS campaign proved to be one of the 
	largest and most demanding boycotts ever carried out by the organization.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	Following the commencement rally, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce promised 
	to hold a “Jobs Fair” on Saturday, October 17<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; CORE demanded 
	that a minimum of 200 jobs be offered to African Americans at the fair, and 
	William Adams, the executive vice president of the Chamber, agreed to this 
	requirement.&nbsp; However, Adams later postponed the “Jobs Fair” indefinitely, 
	further frustrating the Seattle CORE members.<a name="_ednref54" title href="#_edn54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[54]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	As a result of the postponement of the fair, at a CORE membership meeting on 
	October 13, 1964 Walt Hundley proposed a motion that “CORE call a special 
	meeting Saturday which would conduct a leafleting of the Central Area and 
	demonstrations downtown to include leafleting at bus stops and a roving 
	picket.”<a name="_ednref55" title href="#_edn55"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[55]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	According to Hundley, this meeting needed to have at least 50 participants 
	or it would be cancelled.&nbsp; The motion passed with over 40 votes in support, 
	two abstentions and none opposed.&nbsp; As planned, the meeting took place on 
	Saturday, October 17<sup>th</sup> with the participation of 70-100 Methodist 
	students and involved leafleting the Central Area to inform people not to 
	shop downtown.&nbsp; Furthermore, on Monday, October 19<sup>th</sup> from 5 p.m. 
	to 9 p.m. CORE members began demonstrating downtown. The demonstrations 
	included a roving picket and the leafleting of major downtown bus stops.<a name="_ednref56" title href="#_edn56"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[56]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	CORE had strict rules regarding picketing, requiring that men were 
	clean-shaven and women did not wear slacks.&nbsp; No one in the picket line was 
	allowed to engage in long conversations or block the sidewalk.&nbsp; Most 
	importantly, CORE stressed that no one was to respond to verbal or physical 
	harassment in order to keep the picket line free of violence.<a name="_ednref57" title href="#_edn57"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[57]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Seattle CORE members and DEEDS participants hoped their demonstrations would 
	attract the attention of employers and create a significant decrease in 
	sales for downtown businesses in order to secure their goal of 1,200 jobs 
	for African Americans. </span></p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter half of October 1964, with the DEEDS campaign 
	still struggling to secure any jobs for African Americans, CORE decided to 
	continue with the demonstrations and boycott of the downtown Seattle area.&nbsp; 
	In a memo sent from CORE on October 23, 1964, the failure of downtown 
	employers to take positive steps towards putting an end to employment 
	discrimination was reemphasized along with a request for Seattleites to not 
	shop downtown.&nbsp; The memo stated that&nbsp; “CORE wishes to emphasize that the 
	downtown area symbolizes the job inequality of the entire Seattle employment 
	complex, and demonstrations will continue until jobs for Negroes are offered 
	from those industries in … the stores, restaurants, and businesses in the 
	downtown retail core.”<a name="_ednref58" title href="#_edn58"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[58]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	More downtown picketing and leafleting took place on Saturday, October 24<sup>th</sup> 
	and Monday evening, October 26<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; One of the leaflets handed out 
	by DEEDS activists, titled “An Appeal to Black &amp; White Alike,” urged people 
	to boycott the downtown area by not shopping there for personal needs or 
	entertainment purposes.&nbsp; It also demanded that people return their downtown 
	store credit cards and shop in other areas of the city.<a name="_ednref59" title href="#_edn59"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[59]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Another poster created by CORE and spread throughout the Central Area asked 
	individuals and their children to boycott downtown Seattle until jobs were 
	opened and CORE announced success, which could be through the Christmas 
	season if necessary.&nbsp; The poster explained that people could ride the 
	Freedom Bus, a free bus provided by CORE that ran every hour from 23<sup>rd</sup> 
	&amp; Union, to other areas for their shopping needs, or they could use the No. 
	4 bus from 23<sup>rd</sup> &amp; Madison to the University District.&nbsp; The poster 
	urged readers that, while the boycott might be inconvenient and there would 
	be sales to lure them back to the downtown area, the boycott would work if 
	African Americans stood firm and continued to shop elsewhere.<a name="_ednref60" title href="#_edn60"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[60]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	As a result of the picketing and leafleting downtown on October 19<sup>th</sup>, 
	24<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup>, Ernst Hardware Stores hired its first 
	African American employee, which marked the first recorded job gained as a 
	result of the DEEDS campaign.<a name="_ednref61" title href="#_edn61"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[61]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Further demonstrations took place on Saturday, October 31<sup>st</sup> and 
	Monday, November 2<sup>nd</sup> as well as Sunday, November 1<sup>st</sup> 
	to picket and distribute boycott leaflets.&nbsp; While the members of the DEEDS 
	project had not reached their second goal of an additional 400 jobs by 
	November 1<sup>st</sup>, they felt more optimistic as a result of the Ernst 
	announcement as the campaign headed into November. </span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">While 
	Seattle CORE stated that it had the support of various civil rights groups 
	for the DEEDS campaign, a <i>Seattle Times</i> article questioned that level 
	of support and assistance.&nbsp; In an article published on October 25, 1964 and 
	headlined “Civil Rights Groups Indorse CORE Jobs Drive, but Not Boycott,” 
	the author explained that “CORE’s intention to boycott business comes at a 
	time when the Chamber of Commerce has instituted a program to increase equal 
	employment opportunities for members of minority groups.”<a name="_ednref62" title href="#_edn62"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[62]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The article quoted an observer who said that although CORE may have good 
	intentions and good goals, it lacks support.&nbsp; The author also claimed that 
	while the major civil rights groups support the DEEDS campaign, they were 
	not participating in the boycott, and quoted one civil rights leader saying 
	that CORE had a “tiger by its tail.”&nbsp; According to the article, many of the 
	civil rights groups still had faith in the Chamber of Commerce to help 
	remedy the employment discrimination problem in Seattle.<a name="_ednref63" title href="#_edn63"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[63]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This article contradicted the posters and leaflets spread by CORE, which 
	list six or seven participating civil rights groups in the boycott, and 
	raises the idea that CORE was carrying out the boycott of the downtown area 
	without support of other major civil rights groups. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">The 
	month of November saw the continuation of the DEEDS campaign, including the 
	tactics of boycotting the downtown area and spreading leaflets around local 
	communities.&nbsp; The November issue of <i>CORElator</i>, CORE’s monthly 
	newsletter, reported that the most effective time for a boycott was during 
	the Christmas season.&nbsp; The <i>CORElator</i> stated, “If we mean to 
	accomplish anything for our children and grandchildren then let’s rededicate 
	ourselves to making the boycott a success.&nbsp; Everyone has the Friday after 
	Thanksgiving off.&nbsp; Everyone should be on the picket line that Friday.&nbsp; When 
	you are called, tell the caller that you will join the line.&nbsp; And we mean 
	NOW!”<a name="_ednref64" title href="#_edn64"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[64]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The <i>CORElator</i> also urged readers to get “don’t shop downtown” lawn 
	signs and bumper stickers to spread the message of the boycott.&nbsp; CORE sent a 
	letter on November 16, 1964 to 10,000 supporters of the DEEDS campaign, 
	reminding everyone to stop shopping downtown and take the Freedom Bus, 
	private cars, or public transportation to other shopping areas in the city.&nbsp; 
	The letter explained that individuals should shop at University Village, 
	Greenwood, the University District, Northgate, White Center, Renton, or 
	Burien instead of downtown.&nbsp; Enclosed with the letter was a pledge card, 
	which stated the DEEDS Pledge: “I promise to support DEEDS by refusing to 
	shop downtown until DEEDS goals are met (1,200 jobs for Negroes in downtown 
	area) and to shop in other areas.&quot;<a name="_ednref65" title href="#_edn65"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[65]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	CORE requested that everyone who supported DEEDS fill out the pledge cards 
	and return them to the CORE office in order to let the downtown employers 
	know what they were up against. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 110%">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">
	Individuals returned large numbers of pledge cards requesting more 
	information, wanting to donate money, and pledging not to shop downtown.<a name="_ednref66" title href="#_edn66"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[66]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	A collection of approximately 200 returned pledge cards are stored at the 
	Special Collections Division of the UW Libraries and provide a glimpse into 
	the wide variety of DEEDS supporters.&nbsp; Most of the people who filled out the 
	cards lived in the Central District, with several others living elsewhere in 
	Seattle as well as Bellevue.&nbsp; On about half of the pledge cards people wrote 
	the profession they would like to have in the future; these jobs included 
	doctor’s assistant, dishwasher, diesel mechanic, elementary school teacher, 
	retail clerk, hotel bellman, truck driver, maid, and custodian.&nbsp; Women 
	filled out a substantial majority of the cards, and very few listed highly 
	skilled or well-paying professions.&nbsp; While it is difficult to determine 
	whether these supporters were white or black, it can be deduced based on the 
	large number of addresses from the Central District that many were African 
	American.&nbsp; However, as one pledge card read, “I am white and I am employed 
	but I want to know what I can do to make DEEDS a success.” From cards such 
	as this one, it is clear that DEEDS had the support of at least a minor part 
	of the white population of Seattle.<span class="arial10"><a name="_ednref67" title href="#_edn67"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[67]</span></a>&nbsp; Overall, the returned pledge cards provide a picture of the high level of 
	backing from hundreds of individuals throughout the Seattle area as the 
	Christmas shopping season drew near and the news of the boycott continued to 
	spread.</span></span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">In 
	the final month of the year, the DEEDS project reported limited success in 
	regards to the campaign to end employment discrimination. Nevertheless, CORE 
	remained optimistic. The December <i>CORElator </i>reported, “Seattle CORE’s 
	DEEDS Project is really rolling under a full head of steam.&nbsp; The pickets, 
	car-top parades, signs, occupant mailing, etc are all starting to develop 
	into a real effective boycott of the downtown area.&nbsp; And your support, by 
	not shopping downtown, is beginning to bring about some tangible results.”<a name="_ednref68" title href="#_edn68"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[68]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	These results included the active recruiting done by the city for non-white 
	personnel for the police and fire departments, as well as decreased sales 
	downtown.&nbsp; The Equal Opportunity Center, which was a center for employment 
	counseling opened by the Seattle Chamber of Commerce in the Central Area in 
	mid-October, was being regularly advertised on television.<a name="_ednref69" title href="#_edn69"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[69]</span></a>&nbsp; At a CORE membership meeting on December 9<sup>th</sup>, 1964, Bettylou 
	Valentine proposed and passed a motion that the “DEEDS Committee and 
	Executive Board get back into the negotiations with the downtown people 
	before January 12<sup>th.</sup>”<a name="_ednref70" title href="#_edn70"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[70]</span></a>&nbsp; Seattle CORE chairman Walt Hundley sent a letter on December 29<sup>th</sup>, 
	1964 to downtown employers requesting a meeting on January 11<sup>th</sup> with DEEDS representatives.&nbsp; The letter attributed declining sales in 
	downtown stores to the DEEDS boycott but stated that the goal of 1,200 jobs 
	for African Americans has not been remotely accomplished; only 25 downtown 
	positions had been filled by African Americans as of late December 1964.<a name="_ednref71" title href="#_edn71"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[71]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	Hundley claimed that the downtown businesses had made only a minimal effort 
	toward hiring black workers and only in industries such as trucking and 
	light manufacturing were jobs beginning to open.&nbsp; In a closing summary of 
	the DEEDS campaign in the January 1965 <i>CORElator,</i> the newsletter 
	stated,&nbsp; “the boycott of downtown Seattle that CORE spearheaded over the 
	past few months was quite successful … business was horrible.&nbsp; Believe us, 
	and believe in yourself.&nbsp; You are the people who helped to put it over.&nbsp; And 
	it’s beginning to have some miniscule results.”<a name="_ednref72" title href="#_edn72"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[72]</span></a>&nbsp; After the end of the holiday shopping season, the nearly three-month long

	final round of negotiations with downtown employers. <a name="_ednref68" title href="#_edn68"></a><a name="_ednref69" title href="#_edn69"></a><a name="_ednref70" title href="#_edn70"></a><a name="_ednref71" title href="#_edn71"></a><a name="_ednref72" title href="#_edn72"></a></span></p>

	During the negotiations held on January 11<sup>th</sup>, 1965 members of 
	CORE and the representatives of downtown employers had different views of 
	the results of the DEEDS campaign. The <i>Seattle Times</i> reported that 
	the two sides did not agree on the employment statistics.&nbsp; While CORE’s 
	chairman Walt Hundley claimed that only 25 jobs had been filled by African 
	Americans as a result of DEEDS, James Shelver, the representative for 
	Pacific Northwest Bell, said his firm alone had hired at least 25 African 
	Americans in the past several months.&nbsp; William Adams, the executive vice 
	president of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, said he could account for the 
	hiring of about 100 African Americans and asked for support from CORE for 
	the Chamber’s “Jobs Fair” on January 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> to 
	promote the hiring of black workers.<a name="_ednref73" title href="#_edn73"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[73]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	Hundley stated that the African American community was unaware of these 
	numbers and thus would continue pressuring downtown employers.&nbsp; During a 
	CORE membership meeting on January 12<sup>th</sup>, 1965, Ed Singler moved 
	that the “action phase of DEEDS known as the boycott of the entire downtown 
	Seattle area be suspended and a new action be initiated directed at a 
	specific company or industry involving standard CORE procedures.”<a name="_ednref74" title href="#_edn74"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[74]</span></a>&nbsp; The motion passed and thus, on January 12<sup>th</sup> the DEEDS campaign, 
	including the boycott of downtown Seattle as well as the picketing and 
	leafleting, came to a close. <a name="_ednref73" title href="#_edn73"></a><a name="_ednref74" title href="#_edn74"></a></span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">In 
	the February 1965 issue of the <i>CORElator</i>, Charles Valentine reflected 
	on the DEEDS campaign and what it had accomplished for African Americans 
	living in Seattle as well as what important questions still remained for 
	civil rights as a whole.&nbsp; Valentine stated that while the downtown boycott 
	was suspended on January 12<sup>th</sup>, the DEEDS project “reached more 
	people in Seattle than ever before.&nbsp; This was done by …&nbsp; an occupant mailing 
	to 10,000 families in the Central Area, intensive discussion with hundreds 
	of people in small neighborhood meetings, yard signs like those used in 
	political campaigns, auto caravans with car top signs, a public rally, 
	leafleting, and picketing.”<a name="_ednref75" title href="#_edn75"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[75]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	He also applauded all the time and effort put in by members of CORE as well 
	as local friends and supporters.&nbsp; Valentine acknowledged the fact that other 
	Seattle civil rights groups did not support the boycott, and the only groups 
	other than CORE that aided in the boycott were the Unitarians for Social 
	Justice, the Shipscalers Union, and the Teachers Union.<a name="_ednref76" title href="#_edn76"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[76]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	The successes of the DEEDS campaign included the large number of individuals 
	who did not shop downtown during the holiday season, which contributed to 
	Seattle businesses’ declining sales in comparison to previous years.&nbsp; Also, 
	Valentine reported that the federal government was helpful in agreeing to 
	and meeting the goal of hiring more African American workers.&nbsp; However, most 
	other employers were not nearly as cooperative in the negotiations with 
	DEEDS representatives and were not willing to comply with the aims of the 
	campaign.&nbsp; Since the beginning of the DEEDS project, the Chamber of Commerce 
	estimated that at least 100-200 jobs had opened for African Americans in 
	downtown Seattle. The Chamber also held the “Jobs Fair” on January 22<sup>nd</sup> 
	and 23<sup>rd</sup>, which hosted over thirty employers offering jobs and 
	information to thousands of applicants.

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[77]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	Near the end of his report, Valentine posed several questions in regards to 
	the limited achievements of the DEEDS campaign and the widespread 
	difficulties in planning and conducting a successful civil rights project.&nbsp; He asked the reader, <a name="_ednref75" title href="#_edn75"></a><a name="_ednref76" title href="#_edn76"></a><a name="_ednref77" title href="#_edn77"></a></span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Chamber of Commerce 
	came forward as the main representative of private employers who would deal 
	with us in DEEDS, but were we talking to the right people? If not, how can 
	we get through to those who really make the decisions without going back to 
	dealing with one employer at a time?&nbsp; How can we make a large, complex 
	campaign like DEEDS more dramatically clear to the public? Was this project 
	worth the financial expense involved? What can be done about the chronic 
	problem that interest declines and manpower decreases for any project that 
	continues over many months, through holiday seasons and periods of bad 
	weather? Has DEEDS been too big a project for Seattle CORE, and if so how 
	else can we produce significant change toward equal opportunity and an 
	integrated society?<a name="_ednref78" title href="#_edn78">[78]</a></span><span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial">These 
	questions reflected the legitimate concerns of not only those involved in 
	the DEEDS project, but for those fighting for civil rights issues throughout 
	Seattle as well as the country.&nbsp; While Valentine’s report marked the closure 
	of the DEEDS campaign for members of CORE, the national struggle to end 
	employment discrimination continued well into the 1960s and beyond.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 110%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 110%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEEDS was a remarkable and extensive campaign that demonstrated 
	the devotion of the members of CORE as well as its local supporters.&nbsp; All 
	the time and effort put into the project was voluntary, and not even the 
	elected leaders received payment; therefore, individuals gave endless hours 
	of their free time in order to make Seattle a more tolerant place.&nbsp; The full 
	impact of DEEDS can never truly be measured, as the hiring of an increased 
	number of African Americans could have been a result of the recently passed 
	Civil Rights Act as opposed to the demonstrations put on by CORE.&nbsp; However, 
	setting aside the debate regarding the reasons why employers began to give 
	jobs to more blacks in the mid 1960s, the Seattle CORE chapter carried out 
	countless campaigns during the civil rights era and contributed greatly to 
	the advancement of African Americans in all sectors of the community.&nbsp; CORE 
	stated in November of 1964, “if Negroes in America continue to gain jobs in 
	the future at the same rate that they secured them from 1950 to 1960 it will 
	take over 700 years for Negroes to secure 10 percent of all jobs in all 
	categories in this country.”<a name="_ednref79" title href="#_edn79"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[79]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	Fortunately, CORE’s prediction did not come true due to the heroic efforts 
	of blacks and whites alike who were able to show that fervent passion and 
	dedication towards a common goal can generate a significant change in 
	society.&nbsp; May people one day in the future look at CORE’s DEEDS campaign and 
	be inspired to bring about a change of their own in order to produce a more 
	compassionate and tolerant world.&nbsp; <a name="_ednref79" title href="#_edn79"></a></span></p>
