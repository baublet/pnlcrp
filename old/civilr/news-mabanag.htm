			</b>&nbsp;<i>The</i> <i>Filipino Forum</i> was a bi-weekly newspaper published 
			in Seattle from 1928 to 1969 and edited throughout that time by 
			Victorio Velasco. Billed as the 
			“Independent Organ of Filipinos in the Pacific Northwest,” the newspaper 
			presented articles and stories relevant to the growing Filipino 
			community in Seattle and surrounding areas. This report focuses on 
			the founding years, 1928-1930. Early issues of the newspaper&nbsp; 
			dealt with topics ranging from nationalism, the Philippines’ 
			struggle for independence from American rule, the prejudices 
			experienced by Filipinos in the United States as well as in their 
			homeland, to labor unionism. The <i>Forum</i> also published news from the 
			Philippines (“Philippine News in Brief”), from Filipinos from around 
			the Puget Sound and United States (“Bremerton News,” “Here and 
			There,” “News from Minnesota,” and “News from Pullman”), as well as 
			local society news, Filipino poetry in English and Filipino (“Filipiniana”), 
			wit and humor, and good number of advertisements. </span></p>

			<i>The Filipino Forum</i> covered and published issues of importance

			with racial prejudice.&nbsp; In their “<i>raison d’etre</i>,” the paper 
			declared it was not affiliated with any party or particular group in 
			order to always remain independent in their policy.&nbsp; Many of the 
			articles focused on events in the universities in Washington State 
			(University of Washington, Washington State Normal College in 
			Pullman and Bellingham), across the United States (University of 
			Minnesota), as well in the Philippines (University of the 
			Philippines and University of Santo Tomas).&nbsp; The paper also 
			contained society news, poetry, and wit and humor columns.&nbsp; Some 
			articles and poetry were published in Tagalog, the official language 
			in the Philippines.&nbsp; The <i>Forum</i> also aimed to be a link for 
			all Filipinos in the Pacific Northwest as well being thecommunity’s 
			conscience, providing sharp criticism of their follies and 
			encouraging them to be role models for new Filipino immigrants and 
			act as resident-commissioner <i>ex-officio</i> to Americans.</span></p>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;When <i>The 
			Filipino Forum</i> began publication, the Philippines had been a US 
			possession for about 30 years and the ongoing debate over granting 
			the colony its independence was at its highest.&nbsp; The newspaper 
			decidedly supported the end of colonial rule and published numerous 
			articles calling for independence.&nbsp; The newspaper featured many 
			articles that dealt with the various efforts of the occupation 
			government to achieve this end.&nbsp; In the December 15, 1928 issue of 
			the <i>Forum,</i> for example,<i> </i>the newspaper ran a headline 
			entitled, “Quezon’s Xmas Gift.”&nbsp; Manuel L. Quezon was the Philippine 
			Senate President at the time of American rule and at the time of the 
			article was bedridden because of a serious illness.&nbsp; The article 
			reported that Quezon was willing to fly to the Washington, D.C. to 
			meet US President Herbert Hoover as soon as possible, despite his 
			poor health and continue negotiations for Philippine independence.&nbsp; 
			The <i>Forum </i>suggested the only gift that Quezon and the 
			Filipino people could afford was a “nice package labeled ‘Plea for 
			Philippine Independence.’”&nbsp; Furthermore, the paper maintained that 
			though the present was small, it was full of sincerity and gravity 
			and was perennially given to the United States government with 
			fervent hope of finally receiving this ultimately longed-for wish.<sup><a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[5]</span></span></a></sup>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In a March 30, 
			1929 issue, the newspaper ran another article detailing the plan of 
			Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and Senator Sergio 
			Osmena to head another special mission to the United States to work 
			for the independence of the country and voice their opposition to 
			“measures designed against Philippine products.”<sup><a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[6]</span></span></a></sup>&nbsp; 
			A year later the newspaper published an Independence Resolution 
			proposed by Resident Commissioner Pedro Guevara and adopted by the 
			First Independence Congress on February 22, 1930, to be presented to 
			the Congress of the United States, which stressed “the real wishes 
			and aspirations of the Filipino people.”&nbsp; The Resolution stated that 
			however light the control of a foreign power on a country, this does 
			not guarantee happiness to its people.&nbsp; Also, it declared that, 
			mindful of the different problems faced by an independent 
			Philippines such as national defense, finance and economics, 
			politics, and education, the declaration of independence of the 
			country was the only recourse to meet the unalterable desires of 
			Filipinos.&nbsp; Furthermore, it argued: “The uncertainty of our future 
			political status hampers the economic development of the country.”&nbsp; 
			The country needed to be self-governed in order to develop 
			democratically and shed its political dependence from the United 
			States, and editor’s suggested the Philippines was better prepared 
			to attain full nation-hood and “ready to assume the risks and 
			responsibilities of independence.”&nbsp; Most importantly, “in keeping 
			with American history and traditions,” independence was a logical 
			outcome given the Filipino’s “long struggles for freedom.”<sup><a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[7]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>

			also kept the Filipino community updated on the stance of the United 
			States government through its articles.&nbsp; In a perverse way, many 
			representatives of Congress were in favor of granting the 
			archipelago freedom not because of the realization that it was the 
			fitting destiny of a proud people, but the realization that the 
			colonization of the country was beginning to be a drain on the 
			national economy.&nbsp; The United States’ growing dependence on Filipino 
			sugar became a central issue in this debate.&nbsp; Congressman 
			Timberlake, who authored a sugar restriction bill in 1929, contended 
			the only way to remain independent from sugar imports from the 
			colony was through the restriction of Philippine products from the 
			market, because they competed with crops produced by American 
			farmers.&nbsp; However, he stated “as long as the Philippines are 
			retained under the American sovereignty over the repeated appeals of 
			the Filipino people to be free, it will be unfair to punish the 
			Filipinos (for something they are helpless to prevent) by ruining 
			their industries.”<sup><a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[8]</span></span></a></sup>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In a November 
			30, 1929 issue, the newspaper prominently carried an article on the 
			front page about the apparent support of Minnesota Republican 
			Congressman Knutson for Philippine independence. In a statement, he 
			claimed the islands constituted the largest drawback to the 
			agricultural rehabilitation of the United States.&nbsp; The islands, he 
			continued, exported over one billion pounds of vegetable oils and 
			600, 000 tons of sugar, which came into competition with the 
			products of American growers.&nbsp; Knutson claimed that Congress would 
			never set a limit on these huge imports as long as the Philippines 
			remained under the jurisdiction of the United States.&nbsp; The colony 
			would continue to have an advantage in the American markets over 
			other competing nations, because its products would not be subject 
			to the same duties.<sup><a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[9]</span></span></a></sup>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
			Congressional proponents of independence also considered the 
			importation of Filipino goods to be potentially dangerous for United 
			States’ investments in Cuba, which amounted to more than eight 
			billion dollars in the agricultural sector.&nbsp; Carter Field’s article, 
			entitled “National Greed and the Philippines,” suggested past 
			endeavors of American lawmakers to allow self-government for the 
			Philippines were not for selfish motives whereas the current 
			movement for the country’s freedom was tainted by the desire by the 
			members of both Houses to save the government money.<sup><a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</sup> 
			Rather than recognize the legitimacy of political independence for 
			the colony, Carter surmised the economics of sugar and coconut oil 
			would finally win Filipinos their independence.</span></p>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Filipino 
			Forum</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
			editors roundly criticized Congress’ economic reasoning for granting 
			independence.&nbsp; For instance, in a January 15, 1930 editorial, 
			Victorio Velasco wrote that the American people were beginning to 
			favor Philippine independence; a good number of them were 
			representatives in both the House of Congress and Senate.&nbsp; However, 
			if the U.S. were to give the Filipinos self-rule once and for all, 
			it would be done with very different motives from those upon which 
			the Filipinos had based their claim.&nbsp; The granting of independence 
			of the country would have not meant that the American government 
			believed that the Philippines had the fitness for self-government 
			but on the pressure that lawmakers were experiencing from their 
			constituents, namely farmers and investors.&nbsp; The editor of the <i>
			Forum</i>, not without a sneer of contempt and irony, concluded 
			after years of armed struggle against the Spaniards and diplomatic 
			relations with the United States that: “Sugar is solving <u>the 
			Philippine problem</u>.”<sup><a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[11]</span></span></a></sup></span></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another 
			pervasive issue in the<i> Filipino Forum</i> was the 
			sometimes-uneasy relations between Filipinos migrants and 
			native-born Americans.&nbsp; This tenuous dynamic was apparent in 
			everyday life and Filipinos were regularly subject to prejudice.&nbsp; 
			Despite Filipinos’ efforts to integrate in the American society, the 
			newspaper lamented, all too often they were still viewed as 
			outsiders.&nbsp; The November 30, 1928 edition carried an article about 
			the failure of the University Filipino Club to purchase a house 
			(that would function as the group’s headquarters) on 12th Avenue in 
			Seattle.&nbsp; After weeks of negotiation, agreeing on particulars, and 
			raising the money to purchase the building with the help of leading 
			businessmen in the Filipino community, on the day of the signing the 
			owner included a new clause, which leveled stiff interest rates in 
			addition to the base rate of the house.&nbsp; The newspaper reported that 
			a prevalent rumors suggested the owner had changed the contract due 
			to community pressure and anti-Filipino sentiment.<sup><a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[12]</span></span></a></sup>&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In other 
			articles, the newspaper reported on cases of discrimination at local 
			schools.&nbsp; One article, entitled, “Filipino Student Suffers from Pang 
			of Race Prejudice,” recorded an incident involving five Filipino 
			male students of the Normal School in Bellingham, WA who attended 
			the annual “Freshman Dance.”&nbsp; As one student, Antonio Velasco 
			recalled, the boys had not intended to dance with their fellow white 
			female students.&nbsp; However, encouraged and assured by the school 
			president’s wife that they could do so without fear of 
			recrimination, one of the boys asked a classmate for a dance.&nbsp; His 
			request was met with the “quite harsh words,” and a “no, thank 
			you.”&nbsp; The boys were finally discouraged to ask anyone for a dance 
			afterwards.&nbsp; Recounting the incident, Velasco wrote, “If only I had 
			the divine power to disappear… that moment we found out that an 
			attitude of race prejudice was being entertained by some of the 
			girls.”&nbsp; He continued, “It was really strange to me to know that 
			such a discrimination prevail in that school.”&nbsp; They realized that 
			this might have been a single occurrence, but the reality remains 
			that some people harbored race prejudices against the Filipino race 
			and this just served to prove this suspicion<sup>.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[13]</span></span></a></sup>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Throughout the 
			late 1920s, the newspaper covered the tensions between a growing 
			number of young male Filipino migrants to the Pacific Northwest, 
			their white coworkers, and employers.&nbsp; A good number of articles in 
			The Filipino Forum dealt with the backlash experienced by these 
			laborers not only from employers but from labor unions as well.&nbsp; An 
			article in the January 15, 1929 issue, reported that the legislative 
			council of the Seattle Central Labor Council was conducting a study 
			to examine the assertion that Filipinos were swarming into the 
			Northwest and crowding out white labor from the agricultural, 
			lumber, and maritime fields.&nbsp; This particular claim had been brought 
			by a letter from W.J. Henry, a former member and veteran organizer 
			of the American Federation of Labor.&nbsp; In the letter, Henry argued 
			the San Joaquin Valley was now home to 70, 000 Filipinos and the 
			Yakima Valley was being overrun by Filipinos as well.&nbsp; Filipinos, he 
			wrote, posed “a narcotic menace and were … not an elevating 
			influence on our young people.&nbsp; Many of them are marrying white 
			women.”&nbsp; He called upon labor to be vigilant in watching over the 
			“intruders” and not let them take white laborers’ place in the 
			industries.&nbsp; In the same article, the newspaper reported that a 
			recent meeting of the labor council, had suggested that legislation 
			barring or limiting the entry of Filipinos may be sought, and such a 
			movement would be determined largely on the findings of the 
			council’s legislative committee..<sup><a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">[14]</span></a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The <i>Forum</i>

			asserted that Filipinos should be guaranteed the same rights as 
			other American citizens, given their history as a colony. Filipinos, 
			being under the American flag, were right to have access to the same 
			privileges accorded to people under American rule.&nbsp; If some wanted 
			to take away these privileges, the editors quipped, the American 
			flag ought to be taken down from the Philippine islands as well.<sub><a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="text-decoration: none">[15]</span></span></a></sub></span></p>

			though not officially affiliated with any labor organization or 
			political party, endorsed the establishment of the Filipino 
			Laborer’s Association (FLA) in the Editorial section of the 
			newspaper dated May 15, 1930.&nbsp; The newly formed organization would 
			fulfill a much needed role, the article argued, as the 
			representative of working class Filipinos in Seattle and the 
			Northwest.&nbsp; In addition to representing workers, the effect of the 
			organization would spread more broadly as well.&nbsp; The editorial 
			argued, the FLA would also “ create an organ by which the standard 
			of Filipino labor could be regulated; to formulate plans which will 
			enable every Filipino laborer to earn decent wages; and to solve the 
			unemployment problem.”&nbsp; The paper called upon the whole Filipino

			<p class="MsoNormal">

			had a hand in forming a critical and “enlightened” community.&nbsp; 
			Moreover, it provided news from around the United States as well as
