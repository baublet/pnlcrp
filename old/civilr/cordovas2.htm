		    Fred and Dorothy Cordova have been involved

		    in Filipino American activism since the 1950s. They began promoting  Filipino

		    American identity at a young age with student publications and organizations

		    at Seattle University (see 1953 edition of <i>Bamboo: The Filipino People

		    in American Life</i>). They later formed and directed the Filipino Youth

		    Association (FYA), with activities ranging from soccer to dancing and marching.

		    The FYA became an important force for organizing demonstrations in the

		    1960s and 1970s.<font size="2"> </font>

            <p>Dorothy Laigo Cordova  also served as  Director for

          the Demonstration Project for Asian Americans (DPAA), which conducted a wide
              
              variety of studies on the problems Asian Americans faced in the 1970s.
              
              Through the DPAA, she collected research and oral histories. After
              
              the DPAA closed in the early 1980s, the Cordovas moved their work to a
              
              new organization they had created called the <a href="http://www.fanhs-national.org/">Filipino
                
                American National Historical Society (FANHS)</a>, which they still
              
              run today.</p>
            <p>FANHS now has nearly two dozen chapters

          around the United States. In Seattle, it houses the <a href="http://www.fanhs-national.org/Archives.html">National

          Pinoy Archives (NPA)</a>, which is one of the largest collections

          on Filipino American history anywhere. It includes materials on more

          than 9000 individuals and approximately 1500 organizations throughout

          the United States.</p>

            <p>Fred and Dorothy Cordova agreed to shared

          their memories of a lifetime of activism in two videotaped interviews, one

          conducted by James Gregory and Micah Ellison on January 12, 2005, the second by Donald Noble and Michael Schulze-Oechtering Castenada To

        the right are streaming-video excerpts, each about a minute in length,
