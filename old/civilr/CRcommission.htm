		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On October 19, 1977, 
		the United States Commission on Civil Rights (CCR) convened in Seattle 
		for two days of hearings concerning Native Americans in Washington 
		State. The Commission interviewed state, county, and city government 
		officials, as well as tribal leaders and various tribal social service 
		workers, hoping to gain a comprehensive view of the civil rights issues 
		affecting Indians in the Northwest and to devise mutually beneficial 
		resolutions in its recommendations to the President and Congress. The 
		hearings were in large part a response to mounting tension between local 
		government and business interests and Native American communities over 
		the issue of tribal sovereignty. The 1970s witnessed an important shift 
		in federal Indian policy as the post-World War II policy of termination, 
		relocation, and assimilation gave way to greater emphasis on 
		self-determination for native groups and a renewal of government 
		services and treaty obligations. The policy shift prompted a backlash 
		among some non-Indian citizens and government agencies who resented what 
		they considered to be special privileges afforded to Native Americans, 
		especially with regard to Indian fishing rights. The CCR hearings in 
		Seattle provided a public forum for these issues, one that included 
		Indian voices as well as white, and thus mark an important moment in the 
		larger debate over sovereignty, civil rights, and the relationship 
		between government and native groups in American society.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<h1 style="line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">From Termination to 
		Self-Determination: Federal Indian Policy </span></h1>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In August 1953 
		Congress unanimously passed House Concurrent Resolution 108. The 
		resolution signaled a turn in federal Indian policy, one emphasizing the 
		increased assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream society. 
		Reservations around the country were targeted for termination and 
		Indians were encouraged to relocate to urban centers. Ostensibly, HCR 
		108 only changed the status of Indians from “wards of the United States” 
		to ordinary citizens with the same rights and responsibilities as all 
		other Americans.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a> 
		But terminating reservations meant that the federal government was 
		abrogating preexisting treaty obligations and abdicating responsibility 
		for funding social services to Indian communities. Another measure, 
		Public Law 280, took termination of Indian rights even further by 
		shifting the responsibility for Indian reservations from the federal 
		government to individual states. By giving state governments the right 
		to extend their civil and criminal jurisdiction over reservations 
		without the approval of the tribe, PL 280 effectively nullified tribal 
		sovereignty and legal jurisdiction over its members.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The termination tide 
		began to change in the 1960s under Lyndon B. Johnson’s “Great Society.” 
		Anti-poverty initiatives such as the Community Action Programs were 
		particularly applicable to Indian communities. Community Action Programs 
		enabled Indian tribes to apply for federal government grants for 
		economic projects on their reservations and then retain local control 
		over the implementation of funds. In 1968 Congress passed a resolution 
		repudiating HCR 108. The most significant piece of legislation in the 
		Johnson era, however, was the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), also 
		passed in 1968. The ICRA repealed PL 280, giving back legal jurisdiction 
		over reservations to the tribes and, according to James Rawls, “extended 
		to Native Americans (and exempted them from) certain protections 
		guaranteed by the Constitution.”<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Nixon 
		administration continued to roll back termination in the early 1970s. In 
		December 1970, Congress restored 48,000 acres of terminated reservation 
		land to the Pueblo in New Mexico. The next year, the landmark Alaska 
		Native Claims Settlement Act recognized the land and mineral rights of 
		Alaska natives and returned contested land to tribes in Oregon and 
		Arizona. And in 1973, Congress restored federal recognition of the 
		Menominee tribe in Wisconsin, which had been terminated in 1954. As 
		Joane Nagel has written, the series of bills enacted in the early 
		seventies “rang out the death-knell of termination and signaled the new 
		era of self-determination.”<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Rawls points out 
		that the dismantling of termination had less to do with Nixon’s genuine 
		sympathy for the Indian cause than with his “desire to destroy Indian 
		militancy.”<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
		Indeed, the late sixties marked the emergence of Red Power as activists 
		from American Indian Movement (AIM) took possession and occupied 
		Alcatraz Island in San Francisco in 1968 to protest American Indian 
		poverty. Indian militants staged other sieges around the country from 
		1968 to 1972, including a takeover of Fort Lawton in Seattle’s Discovery 
		Park in 1970. Civil rights and anti-poverty legislation, then, was not 
		simply the result of enlightened government, but rather reflected 
		government’s response to the grassroots pressure of Indian activists.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">With all of these 
		prior achievements, the most important piece of Indian civil rights 
		legislation was passed during the administration of President Gerald 
		Ford. In 1975 Congress enacted the Indian Educational Assistance and 
		Self-Determination Act. The act reduced the power of the Bureau of 
		Indian Affairs to control tribal finances. Instead, Indian tribes could 
		decide for themselves what was in their best interests and where to 
		allocate funding. In the process, the act helped change the tribal 
		relationship with federal, state, and local governments. As Nagel 
		argues, the Indian Educational Assistance and Self-Determination Act 
		“provided a reaffirmation of the federal government’s trust 
		responsibility to Indian tribes as well as Indians’ sovereign rights to 
		independence from local and state regulation.”<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the Northwest, 
		the debate over Indian sovereignty and civil rights intensified on 
		February 12, 1974 when U.S. District Court Judge George Hugo Boldt 
		handed down an historic decision on behalf of Native American fishing 
		rights. Boldt upheld the authority of treaties signed in the 1850s which 
		guaranteed Native fishing rights in the “usual and accustomed” places, 
		thereby ensuring that Indians were entitled full access to their 
		ancestral fishing grounds.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
		Boldt’s ruling further specified that fifty percent of all harvestable 
		fish be reserved for Native fishermen. This victory for the Native 
		Americans was a crushing blow to the non-Indian commercial and sports 
		fishing industries.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Boldt decision 
		was both a momentous victory for Northwest Indians and a turning point 
		in relations between Native Americans and the local government and 
		non-Indian citizenry. It continued the path toward self-determination 
		laid out in the Congressional legislation of the late 1960s and early 
		1970s and was thus one of the many positive results emerging from the 
		civil rights movement of the 1960s. However, what Indians considered a 
		great victory set off a new round of conflict between white fishermen 
		and some property owners who questioned why such a small population was 
		granted such a large portion of the fish harvest.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">For the next three 
		years leading up to the Commission on Civil Rights hearing, tensions 
		mounted as non-Indians tried to overturn what they considered the Boldt 
		decision’s reverse-discrimination in the form of special privileges 
		handed to Indians. On September 12, 1977, just one month before the CCR 
		hearing convened, Republican Washington State Congressman John 
		Cunningham introduced HR 9054 in the U.S. House of Representatives. The 
		bill, euphemistically named the “Native Americans Equal Opportunity 
		Act,” was an attempt to reverse the course of federal Indian policy back 
		toward termination. It called for the abrogation of all treaties signed 
		between the United States and Native American tribes and held that every 
		citizen or group of citizens of the United States should have no special 
		or subordinate privileges over any other group. In effect, HR 9054 
		called for the termination of tribal sovereignty. Although it was 
		eventually defeated in Congress, HR 9054 reflected the attitude of many 
		white Americans in the Pacific Northwest in the aftermath of the Boldt 
		decision. Many non-Indians believed that the special privileges that 
		Native Americans had received as a result of Boldt’s ruling gave Indians 
		a type of “supercitizenship;” the resulting prejudice has been termed a 
		“white backlash.”</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The October 1977 CCR 
		hearing in Seattle was an attempt to resolve a longstanding conflict 
		between non-Indians and local government and Indian communities, a 
		conflict that stretched back centuries but had reached a new level of 
		urgency in the wake of the Boldt decision and the twists and turns of 
		federal Indian policy since the 1950s. The Seattle hearing was chaired 
		by Arthur Flemming,<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">11</span></span></a> 
		who explained the Commission’s purpose in his opening statement:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		purpose of the hearing is to collect information concerning legal 
		developments constituting a denial of equal protection of the laws under 
		the Constitution because of race, color, religion, sex or national 
		origin, or in the administration of the justice, particularly concerning 
		American Indians; to appraise the laws and policies of the Federal 
		Government with respect to denials of equal protection of the laws under 
		the Constitution because of race, color, religion, sex, or national 
		origin, or in the administration of justice, particularly concerning 
		American Indians; and to disseminate information with respect to denials 
		of equal protection of the laws under the Constitution because of race, 
		color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in the administration of 
		justice, particularly concerning American Indians.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">12</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Flemming then 
		introduced Commissioner Frankie M. Freeman who outlined the procedures 
		for the hearing.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">13</span></span></a> 
		Freeman advised the participants that any defamatory testimony could not 
		be admitted in open session, but instead would need to be heard in 
		“executive session” with just the Commission members. Additionally, she 
		warned it was a crime to threaten any persons who testified before the 
		Commission because they were protected under Title 18 of U.S. Code 1501. 
		Dr. Patricia Zell, a longtime advocate for Native rights and a member of 
		the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, followed Freeman with a 
		background summary of federal Indian law.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">14</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After the guidelines 
		were established and the history of Indian law given, the hearing began 
		with the first panel of subpoenaed witnesses for the State of 
		Washington: State Representative Mary Kay Becker; Louis Guzzo of the 
		Governor’s Staff for Minority Affairs; State Attorney General Slade 
		Gorton; and Director of State Fisheries Gordon Sandison. Becker was 
		questioned concerning a bill she introduced to the state legislature in 
		1976 granting retrocession of jurisdiction back to the Indian tribes. 
		The bill was designed to countermand Public Law 280 by taking authority 
		over reservations away from the State and returning it to the tribes. 
		However, the bill was shelved when Becker lost the support of the Indian 
		tribes who had been lobbying on its behalf. According to Becker, the 
		tribes felt it would be better to have PL 280 repealed on a national 
		level as opposed to having repeal confined to just one state. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Louis Guzzo answered 
		questions on Washington Governor Dixie Lee Ray’s Native American 
		policies. Guzzo relayed that Governor Ray had been in conversation with 
		the Conference of Tribal Governments regarding solutions to all the 
		Indian issues in Washington State. According to Guzzo, Ray felt that 
		Indian issues would be “the most important domestic issue in the 
		country,” let alone the state of Washington.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">15</span></span></a> 
		As he continued, he stated that he and Governor Ray shared the same 
		concern for equality for all citizens of Washington State:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">We actually are 
		pondering a double society, and we must be sure that whatever 
		negotiations, whatever discussions, whatever results accrue from any 
		talks or negotiations are not only fair to both Indian and non-Indian 
		but do not conflict with the traditions of this country with regard to 
		individual freedom and rights … we must obtain justice for the Indians 
		but not at the risk of injuries to non-Indians.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">16</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Guzzo then assured 
		the Commission that the Governor’s policies would be in keeping with 
		federal law even if she personally felt the law was not in the best 
		interest of the State. Guzzo concluded his testimony by conveying 
		Governor Ray’s belief in the principle of law and the authority of the 
		courts. Guzzo’s references to a “double society” and “justice for the 
		Indians but not at the risk of injuries to non-Indians” indicated that 
		he believed Indians were treated as supercitizens under the new laws.
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Attorney General 
		Slade Gorton was even more critical of what he viewed as Indians’ 
		special citizenship status. He first questioned the authority of the 
		Commission: “I would suggest, however, that the interjection of the 
		Commission into the question of supercitizenship rights of the Indians 
		is neither proper nor appropriate.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">17</span></span></a> 
		This claim by Gorton and Guzzo that Indians were enjoying supercitizen 
		rights was disturbing to Commissioner Freeman. She pointed out that 
		American society had been double-sided since its inception—with the 
		white majority having access to a “supercitizenship” status all along. 
		She continued, “I’m saying this because to the extent that these 
		statements reflect an attitude that misses the recognition that there 
		has been denial of opportunity to minorities and Indians.”<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">18</span></span></a> 
		As Gorton’s testimony continued, he stated that he was also against 
		repealing Public Law 280. He felt that repealing the law would not be 
		beneficial to anyone and that it would only undermine equality for all 
		citizens. Gorton dismissed the idea that rights protected by treaties 
		signed the previous century were still relevant. What the Commission was 
		concerned with, he argued, was “what we consider to be special rights, 
		particularly those created by treaty, which bear no relationship 
		whatsoever, now or in the future, to past discrimination and which 
		simply substitute one form of what we would consider to be invalid 
		discrimination for another.”<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">19</span></span></a> 
		Gorton concluded his testimony by reaffirming his earlier opinion of 
		special treatment by pointing out that Indians did not pay taxes and had 
		special water and fishing rights. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Gorton’s hostile 
		attitude toward Native Americans at the hearing was not surprising.&nbsp; 
		While his service record to Washington State was impressive, he had long 
		been an opponent of Native American rights.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">20</span></span></a> 
		An October 1977 article in the <i>Indian Voice</i> claimed Gorton had 
		“made a career the past four years of opposing Indian property rights 
		spelled out in the federal treaties over which his office has no 
		jurisdiction.”<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">21</span></span></a> 
		Three years earlier Gorton had been opposing council representing the 
		State against the Indian tribes and their bid to reinstate their treaty 
		fishing rights, the case that resulted in the Boldt decision.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">22</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The last witness for 
		the State was Gordon Sandison, Director of Fisheries. Sandison echoed 
		Gorton and Guzzo’s claims regarding the “supercitizenship” status of 
		natives but stressed that this was the sentiment of the general public 
		in Washington and not his own personal view. He spoke on how the 
		Department of Fisheries was working to comply with the Boldt decision 
		and the challenges it presented — specifically the fact that the 
		Department could not please all parties at once and was condemned by 
		Native Americans, the general public, the sport fishing industry, and 
		the commercial fishing industry at one time or another. In addition, 
		Sandison discussed his thoughts for the solution to managing the state’s 
		fisheries — to let Washington State officials handle Washington State 
		fisheries without the interference of the federal government. </span>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .25in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The hearing 
		continued with testimony from Native American representatives. Joe De La 
		Cruz, Mel Tonasket, and Bernie Whitebear were greatly disturbed by the 
		various state officials implying that Indians were supercitizens. From 
		their perspective, the lack of social services and the widespread 
		poverty on Indian reservations made claims of supercitizenship painfully

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I doubt if people in

		a year and have their kids taken away and put into another race’s home.&nbsp;

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Joe DeLaCruz, 
		President of the Quinault Indian Nation and a nationally renowned Native 
		American leader, also refuted the notion of supercitizenship.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">24</span></span></a> 
		He linked it to the rationale behind anti-Indian legislation, which he 
		argued was based on ignorance and empty rhetoric with no factual basis. 
		He also contested one of the pillars of the supercitizen argument – the 
		claim that Indians did not pay taxes: “In the State of Washington, most 
		of the Indian reservations and Indian communities don’t have the super 
		market and the stores and stuff for their produce, so they pay the State 
		sales tax. They pay the State gas tax.”<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">25</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		These statements helped to squash the idea of supercitizenship.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another 
		sticking point was how the government distributed Indian 
		appropriations.&nbsp; Bernie Whitebear, also a Colville Confederated Tribal 
		member, addressed this issue.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">26</span></span></a> 
		Whitebear stated that federal monies earmarked for Indian education took 
		three months on average to arrive. In the interim, grantees were forced 
		to borrow funds against the grant awards. This lessened the overall 
		amount of funds received for the educational programs because of 
		interest and loan fees that were not factored into the original grant 
		sum. All three witnesses concurred that getting any entitlements for 
		their tribes from the federal government was like pulling teeth. The 
		problem was compounded by the layers of administrative paper work and 
		seriously curtailed the development of much-needed programs.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		final issue that was addressed was Indian fishing rights. De La Cruz 
		stated that the Quinault had requested one half million dollars to help 
		with enforcing their fishing rights and that they would work in 
		conjunction with the State. What the Commission overlooked was the 
		larger issue of developing a program of artificial propagation; such a 
		program would have helped take the pressure off of the native salmon 
		stocks and ensure salmon for everyone in the future. Instead, the only 
		issue the government looked at was enforcement to make sure that Indians 
		weren’t breaking the law.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The next group of 
		witnesses was composed of various officials from cities in the Yakima 
		Valley and Yakima Indian Nation. They testified on a range of issues, 
		including the question of who had jurisdiction over the approximately 
		eighty percent of reservation residents who were non-Indian. Other 
		testimony focused on the fact that Indians were exempt from paying 
		taxes. Witnesses also spoke of the resentment non-Indian whites living 
		on the reservation felt toward the Yakima, which fueled the white 
		backlash. Toppenish Mayor Fred Mutch testified about a non-Indian farmer 
		living on the reservation who was upset after the Yakima filed a suit 
		claiming all rights to water that flowed on the reservation. The farmer 
		had to borrow money to dig his own well and Mutch remembered him 
		exclaiming, “to hell with the Indians.”<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">27</span></span></a> 
		Mutch feared that as more situations arose the anti-Indian sentiment on 
		reservations would escalate. Another witness, Yakima County Commissioner 
		Charles Rich, explained how Yakima County officers and the tribal 
		government were working together on improving relations and overcoming 
		the animosity between county officials and the tribe.&nbsp; While there was 
		still a ways to go, Rich felt they were making some progress.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">After a recess, the 
		Commission reconvened in the afternoon and heard testimony from both 
		tribal and non-tribal law enforcement officers in the Yakima Valley. The 
		officers testified about how they were dealing with Indians committing 
		crimes off the reservation and non-Indians committing crimes on it. Of 
		all the groups to testify over the two days of hearings, the law 
		enforcement group was perhaps the most positive in its appraisal of the 
		state of Indian/non-Indian relations and the prospect for cooperation. 
		Both sectors of law enforcement were cross-deputized, meaning that each 
		could arrest anyone who committed a crime in its jurisdiction. 
		Cross-deputizaton helped keep law and order functioning on and off the 
		reservation, which promoted good relations between both tribal and 
		non-tribal governments. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The witnesses for 
		the fifth group of the day were from the Olympic Peninsula and included 
		representatives of the Makah and Lower Elwah Tribes and officials of 
		Clallam County. The animosity between Indians and non-Indians was much 
		more intense than in the Yakima Valley, largely as a result of the 
		fishing issue being more prominent on the Peninsula than inland.&nbsp; Issues 
		addressed included Indian poverty, how the social welfare systems worked 
		with the tribes, and the history of fishing among the tribes, but the 
		testimony centered on white/Indian racial relations. After the Boldt 
		decision, Indians living on the Peninsula were victims of overt 
		hostility. Patty Elofson, chairwoman for the Lower Elwha Tribe recounted 
		how her younger brothers overheard fellow students at their high school 
		speaking of “those damn Indians” when talking about the Boldt decision. 
		This sentiment was supported by Edith Hottowe, Vice Chairwoman of the 
		Makah Tribe: “They’re out in the open with their remarks and attitude, 
		and it is something that is kind of difficult to define; but you sure 
		feel it and smell it, and it doesn’t smell good.”<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">28</span></span></a> 
		Clallam County Commissioner Mike Doherty felt the best way to mitigate 
		prejudice would be joint ventures in the utilization of the Peninsula’s 
		natural resources, coupled with educating the non-Indian populace on 
		Native American regional history. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Once the witnesses 
		from the Olympic Peninsula concluded their testimony, the focus of the 
		Commission shifted northward to Whatcom County and the Lummi 
		Reservation. Of all the counties and reservations surveyed on the day, 
		this area was the hot-bed of antagonism. Commissioners heard testimony 
		from Indian witnesses concerning a Ferndale elementary teacher who 
		kicked a Lummi 6th grade student; Ferndale High School student Lilian 
		Phare also reported that an elementary teacher told her younger sister’s 
		class that Indians were made from clamshells that whites had thrown in 
		the water. Testimony also focused on the animosity between the tribe and 
		the Lummi Property Owners Association. Indian witnesses protested the 
		fact that, like the Yakima Nation, sixty to seventy percent of 
		reservation land was owned by non-Indians. For their part, Property 
		Owners Association members claimed they didn’t know they were buying 
		land on the reservation and complained that Native Americans did not pay 
		real estate or other taxes. Additional testimony was provided by Whatcom 
		County officials who were concerned that the county would have to 
		provide tax-based public services like roads, libraries, and fire 
		services to non-tax-paying Indians on the reservation.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Fishing was also a 
		pressing issue among the Lummi. Forest Kinley, Director of Fisheries, 
		testified that it was not uncommon for white fisherman to fish in a 
		particular area and when the Lummi went to fish in the same area, the 
		State closed it. <span style="color: black">Kinley continued with 
		another prime example of unfair practices by the Fisheries Department</span>:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Just last week, one 
		of the State employees called me and said that we’re going to request 
		that you close Bellingham Bay to Indians because you have caught your 
		share of the fish, and I laughed.&nbsp; I thought, well, gee, that is funny, 
		coming from the State.&nbsp; When they catch their share, they never close 
		down, that they can’t do it because it is against State law.&nbsp; When it’s 
		the Indians’ side, right now we have got to close down.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">29</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Clearly frustrated 
		by the day’s testimony, Sam Cagey, Chairman of the Lummi Business 
		Council, vented, “I would hope that if I had the money I would be able 
		to go and buy Slade Gorton’s land without his permission and Terry Unger 
		and see how they like it.”<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">30</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		This session revealed that there were many angry feelings on both sides 
		of the issues in Whatcom County and that achieving resolutions would be 
		a difficult struggle.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The final witnesses 
		of the day were representatives from the three largest urban areas of 
		the state: Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane. Witnesses spoke of the 
		challenges this diverse group of Indians faced, challenges that were 
		both distinct from and similar to the Native Americans in rural 
		settings. In Tacoma, reported incidents of harassment increased three 
		fold after the Boldt decision. Adding to these incidents was an 
		outlandish rate of unemployment. Out of a total Tacoma Indian population 
		of 7,000, fifty-seven percent were unemployed.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 
		discrimination and unemployment were common on reservations as well as 
		in cities, isolation was one of the unique issues that urban Indians 
		faced. The Indians in the cities came from different tribes from all 
		across the nation. They often didn’t have a common place to meet and 
		kinship ties had been severed, unlike the reservation Indians who could 
		go to their tribal counsel and lived close by their families. Witnesses 
		testified to the difficulty of keeping in touch with other urban Indians 
		so that they did not feel isolated and get lost in the cracks of the 
		system. After this group completed its testimony the hearing adjourned 
		for the day.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
		hearing reconvened Thursday morning, October 20, 1977. Throughout the 
		day a recurring theme emerged: the effects of “white backlash,” 
		especially over Indian fishing rights in the port areas of the state. 
		The backlash took various forms, from verbal harassment and physical 
		abuse to unfair practices by the State Fisheries Department. According 
		to Bruce Jim of the United Columbia River Fishermen, the problems with 
		the State Fisheries Department were not confined to the Lummi:</span></p>

		Washington State game officials have attacked myself striking one of my 
		associates over the head with a shotgun, seizing our fish but making no

		vicinity of the Columbia River.<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">31</span></span></a> 
		&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">
		Witnesses criticized the National Marine Fishery Services as well. 
		According to the Executive Director of the Northwest Indian Fisheries 
		Commission, James Heckman, “[t]he National Marine Fishery Services 
		misrepresented the catch showing the Indians catching a much larger 
		share than they actually caught, and obviously blaming Indians and the 
		Boldt decision for creating some kind of economic distress for Indian 
		People.”<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">32</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		right to fish was the dominant topic of the hearing on both days. 
		Nisqually tribe member and Chairman of the Northwest Indian Fish 
		Commission Billy Frank, Jr. and Councilman for the Yakima Indian 
		Reservation Russell Jim defended their Native American birthright; they 
		explained the cultural and historical significance of fishing for Indian 
		communities. To Native Americans, fishing was more than just gainful 
		employment or food on the table; it was intricately woven into their 
		cultural and religious systems.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">University of 
		Washington Law Professor Ralph Johnson suggested that the anti-Indian 
		sentiment was the end result of a fundamental lack of understanding of 
		Native American treaty rights coupled with the misconception that the 
		Native Americans were catching all the fish—thus depleting the fish 
		runs. Professor Johnson, who founded the Native American Law Center at 
		the UW and whose work helped lay the foundation for the Boldt decision, 
		stated that the treaties Native Americans signed with the United States 
		government explicitly promised them unfettered access to their 
		traditional fishing grounds.<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">33</span></span></a> 
		He testified that Native American fishing rights should not be 
		politicized, “where a majority of citizens can tyrannize a minority.”<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">34</span></span></a> 
		Rather, the issue should be handled in the courts, where they had 
		already been reviewed and upheld. Johnson continued by arguing against 
		HR 9054, which would have abrogated Indian treaties, and refuted the 
		notion that Indian fishing rights endowed them with privileged status in 
		relation to white Americans: “widespread backlash feeling against Indian 
		people … appalls me because we talk about Indians being supercitizens 
		and I would like to find a number of supercitizens that were so 
		impoverished.”<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">35</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 
		Professor Johnson’s panel finished testifying, the Commission heard a 
		statement from John Hough, who was a member of the Washington State 
		Fisheries Task Force. Hough requested that the Commission postpone his 
		testimony so that the task force could have extra time to complete its 
		report. The Commission agreed and then opened the floor to fifteen 
		individuals who wanted to make a statement, limiting each person to five 
		minutes. Once these individuals completed what they had to say the 
		hearing concluded. With so many relevant issues unresolved, the 
		Commission promised to return to Seattle to hear more testimony in the 
		future. The Commission did return on August 25, 1978 and took 
		additionally testimony on the fishing issues. In September 1980, the 
		Commission published it findings from Seattle and other hearings across 
		the country. The <u>American Indian Civil Rights Handbook</u> outlined 
		the comprehensive rights that are guaranteed to every Native American 
		and advised natives where to go if any of these rights were denied.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local 
		newspaper coverage was minimal in comparison to coverage of non-Indian 
		fishermen trying to overturn the Boldt decision. However, articles and 
		editorials did appear in newspapers from Bellingham in the north to 
		Tacoma in the south.<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">36</span></span></a> 
		The overwhelming majority of articles were supportive of the Native 
		Americans’ position. In fact, one<i> Seattle Times</i> article, 
		commenting on the hostility between the Commission and Slade Gorton, 
		specifically singled out Gorton for criticism: “Attorney General Slade 
		Gorton, among the first witnesses, asked immediately, ‘Why are we here?’ 
		and ‘Why are you here?’ “Said Gorton: ‘It is not reasonable to expect 
		the state to accede to the demands of some of the Indians of this 
		state.”<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">37</span></span></a> 
		Echoing the <i>Seattle Times </i>article, the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer </i>reprinted Gorton’s racially charged remarks, 
		“State Attorney General Slade Gorton yesterday described American 
		Indians to the United States Civil Rights Commission here as 
		‘supercitizens’ who get special privileges based on race.”<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">38</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The native periodical <i>Indian Voice</i> also commented on how Gorton 
		challenged the Commission as to whether it had the jurisdiction to 
		meddle in Washington State’s Indian affairs. In addition, <i>Indian 
		Voice</i> described how Commissioner Frankie Freeman chastised Gorton 
		and Guzzo for using the slanderous moniker “supercitizens” in reference 
		to Native Americans.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Tacoma News 
		Tribune </i>and the <i>Bellingham Herald</i> did not center on the upper 
		levels of governmental conflict. Both newspapers did carry one article 
		that mentioned part of Professor Johnson’s testimony defending Indian 
		treaty rights. But for the <i>News Tribune</i> and the <i>Herald</i>, 
		the bigger issue was the local one. This is illustrated by the <i>News 
		Tribune</i>’s coverage of testimony accusing Tacoma of discrimination 
		against the Puyallup tribe: “Local governmental entities are skeptical 
		of the Puyallup Tribe, Miss Bennett testified, ignore it when possible, 
		and have utilized the press and other news media to spread ‘scare 
		stories and monster stories about us.’”<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">39</span></span></a> 
		In the <i>Bellingham</i> <i>Herald</i> it was the contention between 
		Whatcom County and the Lummi that garnered the paper’s attention: 
		“Non-Indians are attempting to terminate the Lummi tribe, Indian 
		witnesses countered. [Terry] Unger said the treaty with the Lummis 
		should be abrogated.”<a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">40</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		For Bellingham and Tacoma the important issues were those close to home.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The U.S. Commission 
		on Civil Rights heard scores of stories from the many distinct – and yet 
		in key ways very similar – groups of&nbsp; Native Americans in Washington 
		State. In addition, the Commission heard from officials in various 
		levels of state, county, and city government. It was clear that the 
		Boldt decision was a catalyst that renewed and heightened discrimination 
		and antagonistic feeling between non-Indians and the indigenous 
		population. It was also apparent in some of the testimony that many of 
		the local governing bodies harbored the same ill feelings toward the 
		Indians. Aside from the <u>American Indian Civil Rights Handbook</u>, it 
		is difficult to determine what the CCR hearing accomplished in the way 
		of substantive results. No major policy initiatives or new legislation 
		emerged in the aftermath of the hearing and many of the issues 
		concerning tribal sovereignty, poverty, racism and discrimination, and 
		Indian treaty rights remain unresolved or hotly contested. Yet the 
		hearing served a necessary function by enabling both sides to air 
		grievances and offer resolutions. It also signaled the continued 
		willingness of the federal government to intervene in local civil rights 
		struggles. Only after we understand the problems can we hope to solve 
		them. For this reason, October 19th and 20th, 1977 proved to be very 
		fruitful days for Native Americans in Washington State.</span></p>
