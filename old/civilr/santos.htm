  	  		<p class="arial10">Robert &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;  		Santos, was the most publicly recognized spokesperson and leader of the  		movement that began in the 1970s to preserve Seattle&rsquo;s Chinatown/  		International District (ID). </p>
		  	<p class="arial10"> The son of  		Filipino immigrant Sammy Santos and an &quot;Indipino&quot; (Native American/  		Filipino) mother, Virginia Nicol, he was born in Seattle in 1934 and  		grew up in the city&rsquo;s Chinatown.&nbsp; He served in the U.S. Marines after  		high school in the early 1950s, and returned to Seattle in 1955 to work  		for Boeing.&nbsp; </p>
		  	<p class="arial10">In the 1960s, Santos became involved in civil rights  		struggles through his involvement with the Catholic Church and the  		encouragement of Catholic Interracial Council co-founder Walt Hubbard.&nbsp;  		While working at the Catholic-run St. Peter Claver Center in the late  		1960s, Santos was able to provide free meeting space to some of the most  		radical civil rights groups in the city, thereby helping facilitate a  		multiracial civil rights sensibility among Seattle activists by making  		the Center what he called &ldquo;the Heart of the Struggle.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1969, he was  		elected President of Seattle's Catholic Interracial Council. </p>
		  	<p class="arial10"> From 1972 to1989,  		Santos served as Executive Director of the International  		District Improvement Association (Inter*Im).&nbsp; In this  		position, he was a pivotal liaison between community activists, private  		businesses, and government agencies in developing and overseeing ID  		preservation plans. The group&rsquo;s agenda included increasing the ID&rsquo;s  		affordable housing stock; preserving its culturally distinct small  		businesses; and providing the neighborhood a range of culturally  		appropriate social services, particularly for its Asian elderly.&nbsp;  		Through Santos&rsquo;s leadership in the ID, he helped mentor a generation of  		young Asian activists in Seattle, earning him the nickname &ldquo;uncle Bob.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="arial10"> In 1982&mdash; along with  		other &ldquo;Gang of Four&rdquo; friends Bernie Whitebear, Larry Gossett, and  		Roberto Maestas&mdash; Bob Santos co-founded the Minority Executive Director&rsquo;s  		Coalition.&nbsp; From 1989 to 1993, he oversaw the Seattle Chinatown/  		International District Preservation Authority.&nbsp; He served as Regional  		Director of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from  		1994 to 2001. </p>
		  	<p class="arial10"> In 2002, Santos  		published an autobiography&mdash;Humbows, not Hotdogs!: Memoirs of a savvy  		Asian American Activist&mdash; which is  a very important source of  		information about the multiracial coalitions that comprised Seattle&rsquo;s  		civil rights movements in the late 1960s and 1970s.&nbsp; Soon after the  		book&rsquo;s publication, he returned to his position as Executive Director of  		Inter*Im, where he worked until retiring in 2005. (For a copy of Santos's memoir, contact Inter*Im) </p>
		  	<p><span class="arial10"> Bob Santos agreed to share memories of  		his activism in the Asian American civil rights  		movements of the 1960s and 1970s in a videotaped interview conducted by  		Trevor Griffey and Michelle Goshorn on November 12, 2004.  </span>
