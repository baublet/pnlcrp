      Seattle branch of the Black Panther Party was the first group established
      outside of the state of California.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
      existence is an illustration of how peripheral branches of an organization
      would both adhere and diverge from the program established by the
      national headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      evidence suggests that the Seattle Panthers often respected the Party’s
      national leadership and worked hard to follow the national agenda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>However, to say that the Seattle BPP was completely dependent on
      Oakland’s guidance and dictates would be an error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The behavior of the Seattle BPP was also influenced by its local leadership and 
		local circumstances in the city of Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;Two 
		and a half years before the start of the Seattle chapter, the Black 
		Panther Party was born in Oakland, California. </span>Huey Newton and Bobby Seale started the organization on October 15,
      1966, and it was originally called the Black Panther Party for Self
      Defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its goal was to
      prevent police brutality as well as establish a new social, political, and
      economic order, heavily based upon Marxist doctrine, to improve the Black
      community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These goals were
      spelled out in the Panthers’ Ten-Point Program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It contained ten demands for Black power, independence, access,
      protection, and rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      effect, it was a demand for equal participation for Blacks in every aspect
      of American society.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[1]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>Aaron Dixon notes that the Ten Point Program was the framework for
      BPP chapters across the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
      activities were to fall within the realm of that mission and weekly
      reports were sent to Oakland to inform personnel at the headquarters how
      the Seattle Panthers were adhering to that program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Dixon adds some discretion was allowed.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[2]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But for the most part the Seattle Panthers did not diverge far from
      the goals and expectations of the Oakland branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This was due in part to the Seattle leaderships’ belief in the
      worth of the BPP program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Members
      of the Seattle Panthers even helped create some of these strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      was a close connection [between Seattle and Oakland].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>We often would travel the I-5 Corridor, it was our subway to the
      Bay Area and we’d often go there two or three times a month, if not more
      often, just to sit down and talk shop with Bobby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      Panther agenda involved constant training.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Members were expected to become experts in weapons usage and they
      were also required to attend political education classes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Upon being accepted into the party, each member had to participate
      in a six-week training program that included reading a list of twenty five
      books.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the Dixons’
      tasks was to organize and run these classes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Aaron Dixon stated that they were “used to make sure that
      everybody understood the ideology of the party and that we were on the
      same page in terms of the theory and the rules of the party.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was the goal of the party, Dixon said, to have informed and
      articulate members.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

      members was one of the Party’s most important tasks early on, and one of
      the target groups was Huey Newton’s notion of the lumpen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Newton had incorporated significant portions of Marxist theory into
      the BPP program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marx had
      discussed the existence of the lumpen proletariat, which he defined as the
      lowest order of society, the criminals, prostitutes, and malcontents of
      the streets.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[5]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Marx eschewed their participation in any socialist movements due to
      what he believed was the lumpen’s inability to take direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Newton understood the lumpen in a different light by applying a
      more liberal definition to the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He believed that the extremely poor who tried to earn a living
      wage but could not because the shortcomings of capitalism were also part
      of the lumpen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Newton believed
      that it would be from this social stratum that the BPP-led revolution
      would find its most dedicated followers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[6]</span></a></span></font></p>

      Dixon guesses that early on some 300 hundred applications were made to the
      Seattle BPP.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among these
      potential members were a large number of Seattle’s “lumpen.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He stated that many who joined the BPP were friends
      of his and were good organizers as well as serious and devoted members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>However, the lumpen also introduced a criminal element to the party
      that was detrimental to the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“A lot of people couldn’t change old behaviors and even though
      we read and studied, we still didn’t have anything to address a lot of
      the negative elements….”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon
      added that one of the tenets of the party as listed in the Ten Point
      Program was to never steal property from the masses.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

      </span>Yet, some BPP members still ended up committing crimes such as
      robbery, vandalism, and assault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
      activities tainted the reputation of the entire organization and were
      fodder for critics who saw such behavior as evidence that the Party was
      more of a street gang than a civil rights organization.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[8]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>Of course, there were applicants from outside the lumpen who sought
      membership in the Party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
      such person was Leon Valentine Hobbs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Hobbs was raised in east New York City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He states,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“I grew up
      with morals….<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our parents
      were very conservative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
      were taught to respect authority….<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
      knew right from wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of
      [my friends] had mothers and fathers….My mother didn’t even work
      because my father was in the navy and made a good salary.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Hobbs said that living in a northern city and coming from a
      “good” family did not shield him from the affects of racism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He remembered hearing of Blacks being killed in New Jersey.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His parents tried to dissuade their children from associating with
      white people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“We knew our
      history and it’s like stay in your place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>My great grandfather was killed in Macon, Georgia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>Hobbs’ most striking experience with racism occurred while he was
      a young man serving in the army.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
      Ft. Dix, in New Jersey, he was called a “nigger” and was then locked
      up when he took offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      was likewise angered by a stint at a military post in Georgia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“We could not even go off the [post] because they were still
      killing and lynching black soldiers if they were caught off base.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They still had separate bathrooms and water fountains…in
      Georgia….And here we are getting ready to go [to Vietnam] to fight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>Hobbs’ experiences with racism had steered him toward the

      Hobbs, white America had given little indication that it was concerned
      with black rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He believed

      Model Cities program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He first
      met Aaron and Elmer Dixon while in the midst of a contentious discussion
      concerning the BPP’s use of allies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Hobbs was attending a birthday celebration for Huey Newton being
      held at a club in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While

      things get thick?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You are
      going to thin out, right?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
      that point, Hobbs said Aaron Dixon approached him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“Aaron...tried to explain to me about the coalition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I said, ‘Man, I don’t care about no coalition….’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I wasn’t in the Party then, [but] I was for Black people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      creation of an alliance of disaffected people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Newton, and others within the Party, concluded that for the BPP to
      succeed, especially politically, a large membership was necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Newton believed that there were numerous segments of the
      America’s disaffected population, who might be willing to unite with the
      Panthers and their agenda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
      groups included the Peace and Freedom Party, the White Panthers, women’s
      and gay groups, the Brown Berets (Chicano), and the Young Lords (Puerto

      “intrigued with the Ten Point Program….<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      willingness to temper his personal inclinations in order to fit the
      requisites of the BPP represents some of the decisions that members had to
      make regarding the alignment of personal and Party ideals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These same decisions had to be made at the institutional level.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Seattle was not Oakland so not all of the dictates emanating from
      headquarters were transferable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
      there were incidents large and small where the local branch took its own
      counsel and acted accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
      involved a visit by the BPP to Seattle’s Rainier Beach High School.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It is illustrative of the role that the Seattle Panthers came to
      find themselves as having within the community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It also exemplifies a level of autonomy that a local chapter could
      have.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aaron Dixon stated that
      after the Seattle BPP had first opened its office it received a large
      number of telephone calls from people within the Central Area who would
      ask the Panthers to attend to various problems such as landlord issues,
      domestic violence, and numerous other problems that arose in a typical
      community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon said that he
      and his fellow Panthers became overwhelmed by these requests so he
      eventually spoke to Bobby Seale about it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Seale said the BPP was not the police and therefore should not be
      responding to those types of calls.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon
      said the Panthers therefore began to ignore requests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This moratorium did not last.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon
      said the office started to receive calls from a particular woman whose son
      was being accosted by white students at Rainier Beach High School.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>During her first call she was told that there was nothing that the
      Panthers could do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But she
      proceeded to call day after day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
      one day she called and it was obvious she was in tears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Around the same time three other mothers called and voiced the same
      concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon said there
      were over a dozen Panthers in the office when this particular set of calls
      came in and they decided to take action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>So they grabbed their guns, piled into several cars, and drove to
      Rainier Beach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they got
      there the Panthers walked into the school with their weapons and found the
      principal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon said they
      told him why they were there and that he needed to start protecting
      students.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon said he
      assured the principal that if the Panthers received more calls regarding
      the problem, they would return.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Besides
      illustrating the Seattle BPP’s occasional autonomy, the Rainier Beach
      incident was also emblematic of the Panthers’ use of the gun as a
      practical and symbolic means to realize their goals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>From the very beginning of the Party’s existence in Oakland, the
      gun was used as a tool for self-defense as well as an iconic
      representation of the Panthers’ commitment to their program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This symbolism overshadowed virtually every other characteristic
      the Party had.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">The
      use of the gun was born of necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One of the first priorities of the Oakland BPP was to put a halt to
      police violence in the Black sections of Oakland.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>To do this, Black Panthers would patrol the streets of Oakland
      carrying a firearm and a law book.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
      strategy was to appear at incidents that involved blacks and police to
      make sure that they followed the letter of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Besides openly carrying guns, the Panthers also dressed in black
      leather jackets and berets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      held weapons training sessions and drilled in public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The group purposely projected an armed, militant persona, and the
      media eagerly portrayed them in that manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One observer noted, “These guys weren’t like the Elijah
      Muhammad guys, who would sell you a two-week-old paper and laugh behind
      your back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They weren’t
      like…Martin Luther King or any of the others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These guys were <u>scary</u>.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[22]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The BPP’s portrayal as armed militants grew out of its rhetoric,
      platform, and armed confrontations between Panthers and the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For example, in 1967, Newton was involved in a shootout with
      Oakland police, in which he was wounded and one officer died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Then, of course, there was the shootout with Oakland police that
      resulted in the death of Bobby Hutton.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In reality, the Panther’s use of the gun represented but one
      aspect of the Party. The move away from that symbol, in 1969,
      indicates an evolution within the Party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This change in policy was not welcomed by all of the BPP chapters
      in the country, but it was generally embraced in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      transformation of the Black Panther Party away from the symbolism of the
      gun to that of what Dixon called a “mainstream” organization took
      place around 1969.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Huey
      Newton was in prison for his 1967 shootout with police he called for a new

      </span>Part of this strategy included the establishment of survival

      confidence that it could take care of itself, as well as help people
      within the community obtain their basic needs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      developing and creating these programs in the Central Area of the city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One immediate consequence in this shift in emphasis was a schism
      that occurred among the Panther Party at both the national and local
      levels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Oakland, Eldridge
      Cleaver believed that escalating rather than minimizing the Party’s
      armed militancy was the more appropriate path, and thus broke with Newton

      still maintained a high degree of militancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A case in point was the Seattle Party’s attempt to procure
      donations for their breakfast program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Elmer Dixon recalled challenging Central Area Safeway grocery
      stores to become more active in giving back to the community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He said that the Seattle Panthers had concluded that Safeway was
      profiting handsomely due to the patronage of Central Area customers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In return the company should therefore donate eggs and sausage for
      children’s breakfasts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      July of 1969, Elmer Dixon presented a letter requesting $100 each week for
      the breakfast programs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      letter added that if the stores did not comply, the Party would raise the
      request by $25 each week.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

      </span>Safeway management reported that after the BPP request was denied,
      Aaron Dixon stood outside the stores with a megaphone, chastising the
      company and making threats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
      some vandalism was incurred at the stores after the BPP request was
      denied, though there was no official link made between the BPP and the
      damage.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn35" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[35]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      of the most significant and groundbreaking survival programs created by
      the Seattle BPP was the establishment of a Central Area medical clinic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The responsibility for this program was given to Leon Hobbs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      Aaron and the Central Committee said they wanted a medical clinic, [and] I

      One
      of the first concerns was gathering funding and supplies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Since the BPP did not allow itself to accept any federal monies,
      all financial resources had to come from private donors. Hobbs said he did
      a lot of asking and his requests bore fruit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Hobbs believes the amount of the donations served to show the level
      of community support that the BPP was able to procure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Aside from contributions from groups and individuals within
      Seattle’s medical community and private sectors, he was also able to
      receive money from entertainers Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, Greg Morrison,
      and Buddy Miles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hobbs also
      adds that funding, material, time, and expertise donations came from white
      as well as black sources.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      explains that the clinic started small, beginning with well-baby checkups
      a couple of times each week, and soon added adult care.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>According to Hobbs, one of the most important contributions of the
      clinic was the establishment of a sickle cell anemia testing and genetic
      counseling program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bobby
      Seale stated that the Seattle sickle cell testing program was the most
      affective of all of the BPP’s sickle cell programs in the nation.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn37" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[37]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      the creation of the survival programs in Seattle, it could be argued that
      the Dixons had not really diverged from the methodology of Larry Gossett
      and the BSU after all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
      previously stated, it became clear in the minds of Panther members in both
      Oakland and Seattle that the public display of firearms could be
      detrimental to the organization’s ultimate goal of a political and
      economic presence in American society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>So alterations to the Party’s public persona were made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The guns were not discarded, but they were tucked away from the
      public’s view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
      public perceptions of the Panthers did not change as quickly as their
      methodology did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
