	<p align="left" class="arial10"; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: .0001pt">The body  of Raisa Trytiak was found in garbage dump  north of Seattle on February 9, 1967. It appeared   at first that the 24-year old Seattle bank employee  had been strangled, but the coroner determined   that she had died following an illegal abortion. A  former construction worker confessed to   helping with the procedure and pled guilty to manslaughter. One month later, on   March 6, 1967, 22-year old Elizabeth Zach Staley died in Olympia from another   botched abortion. These are but two of many women who lost their lives because   Washington State law prohibited abortions except when the life of the mother was   in danger.<A title="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</A></p>

	  <p class="arial10">But Raisa   Trytiak and Elizabeth Staley were among the last victims. Because of their   tragic stories, a group of Seattle residents launched a campaign to change the   law and three years later, in 1970, Washington became one of only a handful of   states to permit abortions in the early months of a pregnancy and the only one   to enact its reformed law through a vote of the people. Several years before   the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Roe v.   Wade</em> that abortion was a constitutional right, Washington voters approved   Referendum 20, establishing a limited but very important right to seek an   abortion.<A title="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">This report   explores the campaign, both in the legislature, which authorized the ballot   measure, then as it went to the voters in the fall of 1970. Approved by Washington citizens with 56.49% of the vote, Referendum 20   


succeeded because its campaign strategists swayed undecided voters with a focused message of abortion as a healthcare issue instead of solely an issue of women&rsquo;s choice.  Key too were  compromises enacted in the legislature requiring  that a woman seeking an abortion must gain the permission of her spouse or guardian, that she would have to live in Washington state for 90 days, and that the procedure could take place only within the first four  months of pregnancy. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Although these restrictions were not favored by many of the proponents, the compromises led to an unexpected coalition in support of reform. It would come as a surprise today that the legislative votes in the state House and Senate to authorize the referendum came from both political parties before the bill was signed and sent to the voters by Governor Dan Evans, a Republican. It would come as a further surprise that the organization leading the effort to decriminalize abortion was thoroughly bipartisan and included as many men as women.</p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>A Dangerous Felony </strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Abortion was not   always illegal in the United States, but by the early 1900s every state had   criminalized the procedure. Washington revised its law in 1909, making it a crime to end a pregnancy except   to save the life of the mother. This led to illegal abortions being performed without standardized safety or sanitation, Assisting with an abortion was a felony   punishable by five years in prison, to which manslaughter charges could   potentially be added. Regardless, thousands of women broke the law and many   suffered for it, some dying, others permanently insured. By the late 1960s, some   hospitals were willing to stretch the law, granting a limited number of &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo; abortions provided a specially appointed committee of physicians   said it was medically necessary. 


The double standard that ensued stratified which women would be able to obtain abortions safely, where &ldquo;wealthy women went to private physicians who &hellip; interpreted legal exceptions for therapeutic abortions broadly enough to satisfy their patients&rdquo;, and low-income women were left with whatever they could afford.<A title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</A> But for most women, the &ldquo;back-alley&rdquo; abortion   was the only way to terminate an unwanted or even dangerous pregnancy.<A title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Efforts to   reform abortion laws gathered momentum across the country in the late 1960s,   aided by the women&rsquo;s liberation movement that had emerged to challenge the whole   complex of gender inequalities and restrictions on women&rsquo;s life choices and   opportunities. The National Organization for Women (NOW) and other women&rsquo;s rights activists joined with Planned Parenthood  in considering the right to an abortion &ldquo;an essential ingredient of   women&rsquo;s moral autonomy and freedom.&rdquo; Their campaigns bore fruit in several   states. In 1970, Washington, Hawaii, New York, and Alaska legalized abortion.<A title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Washington was   unique because abortion was legalized through a popular referendum by the   voters, not by the legislature. A referendum in Washington State requires   approval from the state House, Senate, and Governor to be placed on the ballot.   The voters then can vote to &ldquo;approve&rdquo; or &ldquo;reject&rdquo; the measure to decide its   outcome. Referendum 20 was eventually &ldquo;superseded&rdquo; by the decision of <em>Roe v.   Wade</em>, and then by Initiative 120, passed by voters in 1991, which embedded   the key guarantees of <em>Roe </em>in state   law.<A title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>Washington   Citizens for Abortion Reform</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The campaign for   Referendum 20 was launched not long after Raisa Trytiak&rsquo;s death became news. While NOW and other groups had been working for several years on the issue,  a small discussion group that later evolved into the Washington   Citizens for Abortion Reform (WCAR) would design the legislative campaign that led to R-20.  It started in the office of Dr.   Samuel Goldenberg, a Seattle psychologist, who was concerned that some of his   clients who wanted to obtain an abortion could not do so under the tricky   process that required approval from a &ldquo;hospital physician committee.&rdquo; <A title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</A> In 1968, Goldenberg created the &ldquo;Citizens&rsquo;   Abortion Study Group&rdquo; that met regularly to explore the many issues related to   abortion. Early members of this group included Marilyn Ward, a volunteer   lobbyist of children&rsquo;s issues who later became the lobbyist for the bill that   became Referendum 20,  Republican State Senator Joel Pritchard, and Reverend   Everett J. Jensen, General Secretary of the Washington State Council of Churches. After   meeting for almost a year, the group &ldquo;had reached a consensus that the law   needed to be changed.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The   founders of Washington   Citizens for Abortion Reform worked with legislators from the Seattle   and King County area to introduce a bill in the state House and Senate during the   1969 legislative session. The House bill was sponsored by Representative Bill   Chatalas (D-Seattle), and the Senate companion bill by Senator Joel Pritchard   (R-Seattle). The House version of the bill did not make it through the House   Health and Welfare Committee, and the Senate version was waylaid in the Senate   Rules Committee.<A title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</A> Despite pressure by abortion reform and women&rsquo;s groups, with more than 1,000   attendees at a rally on March 28, 1969, many legislators were not willing to take a stand on the   controversial issue. Frank Atwood, the Republican Senate Minority   Leader, said &ldquo;he view[ed] the issue as &lsquo;so hot and divisive&rsquo; that it will   eventually wind up before the voters.&rdquo; <A title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</A> The   1969 legislative session ended with no further movement on the abortion bill. </p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>The &ldquo;Extraordinary&rdquo; Legislative Session &ndash; January 1970</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Goldenberg,   Ward, Pritchard, and the other reformers were determined to try again.  In January of 1970, they had their chance.   Governor Dan Evans called for the first &ldquo;Extraordinary&rdquo; session of the state   legislature, now known as a &ldquo;Special Session.&rdquo; During this additional   legislative session, the floor calendar for bills to be considered was reset,   meaning policy bills thought to have no chance of passage came into play once   more.<A title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The   Citizens&rsquo;   Abortion Study Group, newly     renamed as Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform (WCAR), decided to seize   the opportunity presented by the special session. In an Executive Committee   meeting held months before the legislature was to meet, members voted  that the organization's purpose should be to &quot;influence the legislature to pass   its abortion bill in the special session of January 1970&rdquo; and to &ldquo;carry on   education, fundraising, and lobbying&rdquo; and apply &ldquo;pressure on legislators when   and where it [was] needed.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</A> Seattle Republican Senator Pritchard, a founding   member of the original group, agreed to reintroduce the bill that had stalled in   the Senate the year before with Senators Robert Bailey (D-19, Grays Harbor) and   Francis Holman (R-1, part King) as cosponsors.<A title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Meanwhile   in the House, supporters managed to pass the bill from the previous session on   January 24th, 1970. Potentially one of the most liberal abortion   laws in the country, the House version simply removed all criminal penalties   for women seeking abortions and from the physicians who would perform them,   establishing an unrestricted right to seek an abortion.<A title="" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</A> This created a strategic challenge for WCAR since it was clear that the more   conservative Senate would not approve the House measure. Worried that the   legislature might again fail to pass a new law, Senator Pritchard and WCAR   leaders calculated that even some legislators reluctant to support a new law    would agree to a referendum that would   put the issue to a vote of the people. This would require a new bill that would   have to pass both chambers, be signed by the governor, and be approved on the   ballot by the people of Washington with a simple majority.<A title="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The   new abortion reform bill, Senate Bill No. 68, was referred to the Senate   Judiciary Committee upon reintroduction on January 12, 1970.<A title="" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</A> In hearings before the Committee, Pritchard faced determined opposition from   Senators who wanted to make the proposed language more restrictive. Senator   William A. Gissberg (39-D, Snohomish County) and Senator William S. Day (D-4,   part Spokane) interrogated what it meant for a woman to be &ldquo;quick with child&rdquo; and   argued that procedures should only be allowed in the first few months of   pregnancy and only with the consent of the husband or parent. Sen. Gissberg   moved to add the   following restrictions:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p class="arial9">&ldquo;(a) with her   prior consent, and, if married and residing with her husband and if unmarried   and under the age of eighteen years, with the prior consent of her husband or   legal guardians, respectively, (b) if the woman has resided in this state for at   least ninety days prior to the date of termination...&quot;'<A title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</A></p>
	    </blockquote>	  <p class="arial10">Sen. Day further   amended Sen. Gissberg&rsquo;s amendment to clarify &ldquo;of a woman not quick with child &hellip;   and not more than four lunar months after conception.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">As   the amendments were debated in the Judiciary Committee, WCAR faced a dilemma.   Such restrictions were contrary to the idea that a woman should control her own   healthcare choices, which had been the firm position of Washington   Citizens for Abortion Reform and other groups.   This was a difficult decision for Marilyn Ward, WCAR&rsquo;s lobbyist at the time. The   amendments were strongly opposed by women&rsquo;s rights groups, but seemed necessary   to gain the approval of the mostly male conservative Senate. Ward &ldquo;agreed, and &hellip;   got raked over the coals &hellip;.&rdquo; The choice, she decided was &ldquo;are you going to lose   on principle, or win on compromise?&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</A> WCAR and Ward&rsquo;s decision to compromise to garner the votes for what became   Referendum 20 was integral to the success of the bill&rsquo;s passage, and later the   referendum campaign. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Ward   was a realist and at other moments negotiated additional compromises in order to   advance the campaign. That was the instinct behind the WCAR decision to have   men, and particularly male doctors,  in   key leadership positions.  Throughout   much of the campaign Dr. Goldenberg was the public face of the movement. Ward   and others calculated that the respected psychologist would be more likely to   sway male Senators than more radical women&rsquo;s rights groups. In her interview   with Cassandra Tate she mentions another compromise. She intervened to stop a   planned demonstration by women&rsquo;s rights activists from Seattle&rsquo;s   Central District who favored the bill, worried that it might scare off   conservative Senators.<A title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The   amended SB No. 68 narrowly passed the Senate 25-23, with one Senator absent.   <a href="referendum20_appendix.htm">Appendix 1</a> shows the final senate vote and reveals something important.  The vote was thoroughly bipartisan, with 14   Republicans and 11 Democrats voting in favor.<A title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</A> It is also noteworthy that most supporters in King   County, the most populous county in the state, were Republicans, while the King   County opposition in the Senate came largely from Democrats.<A title="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[23]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>Floor   Debate in the House</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">The   House accepted the Senate&rsquo;s amendments to the bill in early February 1970, but   the process was certainly not easy. As in the Senate, House members did not   divide along party lines as they are understood today, where Democrats mostly   support access to abortions, while Republicans often oppose them. Instead the   main opponent of the 1970 bill was a female Democrat from Spokane,   Representative Margaret Hurley. Hurley proposed that the bill be   indefinitely postponed. In recorded audio tapes from the House floor session of   February 3, 1970, she can be heard expressing disgust that the &ldquo;House would even   consider this vicious kind of legislation.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[24]</A> Representative Gary Grant called for a roll-call   vote, and Hurley&rsquo;s motion to postpone failed. Rep. Lois North (D - King County),   another of the handful of female legislators serving in 1970, supported of SB   No. 68. She can be heard explaining that the Senate version of the bill was far   narrower than the one which had passed the House during the regular session.   Rep. North warned that any changes proposed to the Senate bill by the House   would kill it because the Senate version only passed by a two-vote margin, &ldquo;we   need to be prepared to stand by Senate Bill 68 exactly as it is before us &hellip; The   Senate is in no mood to go to a conference on this issue.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[25]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">This   discussion of the tenuous nature of the bill led Rep. Hurley to introduce   several amendments that would have further restricted a woman&rsquo;s ability to   obtain an abortion. First, she tried to make it so that a woman would need a   recommendation from three different doctors before the procedure, and then   attempted to amend the bill to make it a felony for a doctor to perform an   abortion. However, Rep. Hurley&rsquo;s attempts to stop the bill were unsuccessful,   and it was moved to third readings in the House.<A title="" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[26]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">A   bill is most likely to be moved to third readings, and be voted on the floor   when leadership already knows it has the votes to pass. There were several   remarks on the floor before the vote. Representative North&rsquo;s speech was   indicative of the talking points WCAR would use in the coming referendum   campaign. Rep. North noted that this bill would &ldquo;drive the illegal, unqualified   abortionists out of business.&rdquo; She explained that &ldquo;many, many women in   desperation have submitted to treatment at the hands of unlicensed quacks, only   to suffer untold misery. With Engrossed Senate Bill 68, safe and legal medical   care will be available without exorbitant cost when and where it is   needed.&rdquo; Rep. North also expressed support   for the referendum clause, to let the voters decide how they felt about the   issue.<A title="" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Once   again, Representative Hurley spoke against the bill, and said it would end   thousands of lives. Other representatives made floor speeches about the   circumstances of the bill, such as their displeasure with being forced to   accommodate the Senate&rsquo;s amendments. A few  quoted the Bible as part of their remarks.   Others said they had voted against the House version of the bill, but approved   of the safeguards in the Senate version. After much debate and discussion, ESB   No. 68 passed the concurrence process in the House 64-31, with four members   absent.<A title="" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[28]</A> After the bill was again reconciled with the Senate, it was sent to   Governor Dan Evans who signed it quickly. He had been a supporter from the   beginning. And so the stage was set for one of the most contentious ballot   measure campaigns in Washington state history.</p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>The   Voice for the Unborn</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10">In May 1970, a   statewide group that opposed the passage of R-20 was formed. It was named the   Voice for the Unborn (VFU) and was led by Mrs. Alden Olsen. The other members   were Mrs. Ahnquist, Mrs. Bennett, Kenneth VanDerhoef, David Warmuth, and Wes   Holbein. It had the support of many Catholics and members of socially   conservative Protestant churches. The Voice for the Unborn focused their   argument against the approval of R-20 on the idea that life began at conception,   and that the abortion of the fetus was a moral wrong. They launched their   campaign with a five-point argument against legalizing abortion. VFU argued that   abortion was not consistent with current legal practices, that it allowed &ldquo;barbaric surgical techniques&rdquo;, that the law was &ldquo;regressive&rdquo; in the protection   of life, that the legalization of abortion in other states did not deter illegal   abortions, and finally, that it would create new problems for hospital   infrastructure. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">What   we know about the Voice for the Unborn comes mostly from their newspaper ads and   from pamphlets collected by their opponents; organizational records were not located. But the available documents provide a sense of the VFU   campaign, showing that they focused on the   importance of the life of the fetus and the negative social consequences that   would result if abortion were legalized. The VFU used controversial and   disturbing advertising to draw attention to the issue. And much of their effort   went into that advertising, although Voice for the Unborn had an impressive   field operation as well, with a reported plan to knock on over 40,000 doors   between September 17th and the general election.<A title="" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[29]</A> However VFU&rsquo;s efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in stopping the passage of   Referendum 20, and they might have even been a contributing factor in its   passage.  By comparing the infrastructure   of Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform&rsquo;s campaign and its press coverage   versus that of VFU, it is evident that WCAR was better organized to convince   voters to approve Referendum 20. </p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>Restructuring   WCAR</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10"> Once the referendum had passed both   houses of the legislature and had been signed by Governor Evans, the real work for WCAR began. The members of   Washington   Citizens for Abortion Reform needed to build a   statewide campaign to win the election. To do that the organization changed its   internal structure and leadership. Dr. Goldenberg stepped down as   chairman&mdash;although he remained involved&mdash;and Victoria Livingston resigned her position as   Executive Director for &ldquo;personal reasons not related to the job&rdquo; on March   28th. Livingston advised that the next WCAR leadership should consist   of a male chairman with a medical background, and that the Executive Director be   a &ldquo;fulltime, top-notch female executive.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30">[30]</A> Senator Pritchard and the rest of the team began to   draft a public relations message. Pritchard suggested that WCAR focus on   reaching out to moderate voters. Instead of relying on women, &ldquo;doctors should be   out front, concerned about the health of our patients.&rdquo; Instead of focusing on   the idea of legalizing abortion, Pritchard urged WCAR to promote the safeguards   of the bill, asserting that &ldquo;women&rsquo;s rights people [would] vote for us   anyway.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[31]</A> It was agreed that the best way to promote Referendum   20 would be to focus on winning over moderate voters by focusing on the health   benefits and to emphasize the support the medical community&rsquo;s support for the   measure. </p>
	  <p class="arial10">Between   April and August of 1970, the members of the Executive Committee of WCAR met   regularly in the cafeteria of Swedish Hospital at 7:30 AM to plan the   campaign.<A title="" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32">[32]</A> Although most of  the Executive Committee   meeting minutes have been lost, the minutes that are available provide a glimpse into the   internal deliberations of a successful statewide campaign. In April of 1970,   Genevieve Lane was hired as the temporary Executive Director. Her political   insight proved valuable to the effort. She emphasized that &ldquo;dignity and a   low-key tone&rdquo; would be the best strategy.<A title="" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33">[33]</A> To build the campaign after the legislative session   required re-contacting their members across the state, and to define their role   in relation to the Referendum 20 campaign. Lane believed the methods of contact   that had been used during the session were &ldquo;inconsistent&rdquo; and that &ldquo;they have   not been in any way been related to the true campaign effort&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34">[34]</A> Lane served as the Executive Director of WCAR until   June 30, 1970, when she was replaced by Helen Bonds.<A title="" href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35">[35]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">Although   WCAR could start planning and raising money immediately after the legislative   session, they did not plan to roll out the full campaign until after the   September primary election. Referendum 20 would be on the November general   election ballot. The recruitment of volunteers was essential to the campaign&rsquo;s   ability to contact as many voters as possible, especially because the Voice for   the Unborn had reportedly recruited volunteers to knock on 40,000 doors after   the primary election.<A title="" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36">[36]</A> In a newsletter to supporters, Bonds emphasized that &ldquo;doorbellers should not go to work until <U>after</U> the primary (Sept. 15) so   as not to confuse the voters into thinking the issue is on the primary   ballot.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37">[37]</A> </p>
	  <p class="arial10"> For their message to reach the public, the   infrastructure for the grassroots campaign would need to be put in place. The   April meeting established the early foundation of the campaign, with volunteers   already staffing the Washington   Citizens for Abortion Reform office in downtown   Seattle from 9 AM &ndash; 3 PM five days a week.<A title="" href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38">[38]</A> However, they needed to reach voters all over the state and that could not be   done for free. WCAR board members began to request donations of $50 &ndash; 250 from   members statewide, and built a database of contacts from the organizations that   supported the proposal during the legislative session, such as nurses and social   workers&rsquo; advocacy groups.<A title="" href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39">[39]</A> As Mrs. Campbell, a volunteer from Queen Anne, put it, the organization &ldquo;ha[d]   extremely limited funds, for advertising, so it &hellip; [was] extremely important that   [they] present[ed] their viewpoint &hellip; to the voters through person-to-person   contact&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40">[40]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10"><strong>The   Ground Game</strong></p>
	  <p class="arial10"> As early as June of 1970,   representatives of WCAR formed county chapters led by volunteers and coordinated   by a Central Committee. The campaign was strong in Seattle and needed to   establish a presence in more conservative areas of the state, particularly east   of the Cascade Mountains. By June 8th, committees were created in &ldquo;Spokane, Tri-Cities, Walla Walla, Tacoma, Pullman, Yakima, Vancouver,   Wenatchee, Everett, Olympia, [and] Bellingham.&rdquo; <A title="" href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41">[41]</A> By June 22nd, the campaign announced that &ldquo;area chairmen&rdquo; &ldquo;had been appointed to 14 cities throughout the state.&rdquo; While   Genevieve Lane was the Executive Director, she recommended that the &ldquo;individual   committees throughout the state should organize under their own banner &hellip; but in   order to keep some control, [WCAR] should keep in constant communication with   out-of-city groups and have constant report with them.&rdquo; Lane established that   these committees would be provided with talking points, press materials, and   other campaign supplies.<A title="" href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42">[42]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10">These   recommendations were further implemented under Helen Bonds as the grassroots   effort increased at the end of the summer of 1970. Bonds supplied the county   committees with &ldquo;speakers kits,&rdquo; bumper stickers, buttons, fliers, and   training.<A title="" href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43">[43]</A> It was common for the county chairmen to recruit volunteers through &ldquo;coffee   hours&rdquo; that functioned as volunteer recruitment and information sessions about   R-20 where there would be &ldquo;an informed and unemotional discussion of the   issue.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44">[44]</A> Much of this recruitment was urged before the end of the September primary   election. County chairmen were also advised to gather additional contacts   through their local legislators of those who had written letters to their office   favoring abortion reform. By August, even more branches of WCAR committees had   formed for Aberdeen-Hoquiam, Arlington, Ellensburg, Ephrata-Soap Lake,   Longview-Kelso, Mount Vernon, Port Angeles, and Washougal.<A title="" href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45">[45]</A></p>
	  <p class="arial10"> Who were the volunteers who worked on the   ground to pass R-20? Early on, they were described as &ldquo;reliable and intelligent   types,&rdquo; who worked in the Seattle campaign headquarters, and many who planned to   work from home and be &ldquo;called on as the campaign intensifie[d].&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46">[46]</A> The information available on the volunteer area committee chairs shows that most   of the committee chairs were married women and male doctors. Several committees   were chaired jointly by married couples. One chair was a professor at Central   Washington State College, and there was a student co-chair in Bellingham,   presumably at Western Washington State College.<A title="" href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47">[47]</A> It is not clear if all of the female committee chairs   were married, or if the title of &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; was applicable to both single and   married women at the time. This base of volunteers was expanded further as   numerous groups endorsed R-20 and committed to help pass the measure. </p>
	  <p> <span class="arial10">Correspondence between Helen Bonds   and the committee chairs gives context to the different challenges faced by each   county. Spokane&rsquo;s chairman, Dr. Thomas Reed, described the abortion measure as   &ldquo;the hottest thing going&rdquo; in the Spokane area because of its &ldquo;large Catholic   population &hellip; and &hellip; religious fundamentalists, and a very politically   conservative populace.&rdquo; Dr. Reed predicted that his chapter would have &ldquo;the   toughest battle in the state.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48">[48]</A> Each county had varying chances of winning approval for R-20 based on its voter   turnout and political preferences. It was the job of these volunteers to educate   as many voters in their jurisdictions as they could about Referendum 20, and to   persuade them to support it using their own personal reasons, and the message   created by WCAR.</span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"><strong>Family Rights or   Women&rsquo;s Rights? </strong></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">By portraying   Referendum 20 as a commonsense medical issue, Washington Citizens for Abortion   Reform was able to appeal to moderate, undecided voters. That was also the   intent behind the campaign&rsquo;s principle slogan: &ldquo;Let Each Family Have the Right   to Decide.&rdquo; The message-- &ldquo;Let Each Family Have the Right to Decide.  Vote for Abortion Reform. Vote for Referendum   20.&rdquo; --was displayed on bumper stickers across   the state. <A title="" href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49">[49]</A> In adopting this slogan, the executive committee    heeded the early advice of Senator Pritchard who had urged an appeal to   middle-ground voters who did not have a firm stance for or against abortion.   WCAR had learned in the Legislature that a proposal with restrictions requiring   the consent of a husband or guardian, would be necessary to gain sufficient   support. Now in its public campaign WCAR built on the idea of a family&rsquo;s right   to decide. This was not what women&rsquo;s liberation organizations wanted to hear,   but it appears that there were few strong complaints. From Executive Committee   meeting records and Marilyn Ward&rsquo;s oral history,<A title="" href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50">[50]</A> it is evident that radical women&rsquo;s rights organizations played an important role   in the passage of Referendum 20, but that they were not included in the internal   deliberations of WCAR&rsquo;s strategy. By portraying abortion reform as a medical   issue and a family freedom of choice issue while keeping radical women&rsquo;s groups   at arm&rsquo;s length, WCAR gained the credibility it sought, winning a broad base of   endorsements from dozens of mainstream groups, and achieving mostly positive   press coverage. </span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"> Like the Voice for the Unborn,   Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform spent heavily on newspaper ads. Most   WCAR ads emphasized safety. An ad placed by the organization in late October of   1970 read: &ldquo;<em>It isn&rsquo;t pleasant to think about abortion, but it isn&rsquo;t pleasant   to think about women mutilating themselves and ruining their lives either,</em>&rdquo; which referred to the gruesome practice   of self-induced abortions. The ad continues with &ldquo;<em>Remember: abortion reform   is overwhelmingly endorsed by doctors, clergymen, nurses, and social   workers</em>.&rdquo; This appeal to medical expertise was the key ingredient in the   WCAR strategy.  By showing that the   procedure was medically sound, and supported by many members of the clergy,   abortion was shown to be a proposal favored by a broad base of highly   responsible authority figures. The ad ends with &ldquo;<em>they know the tragedy caused   by our present laws. They believe in this humane and compassionate reform. Vote <U>for</U> Referendum 20</em>.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51">[51]</A></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"> In one case, WCAR issued an   advertisement that struck a different note. <em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard from the voice for   the unborn, now let&rsquo;s hear from the abused child, the abandoned wife, the   poverty-stricken mother of four </em>&hellip;&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52">[52]</A> This ad raised a new set of issues, noting the social problems that might follow   from unwanted pregnancies, problems of poverty, neglect and abuse. This  however was not the campaign's usual message   which mostly focused tightly on medical concerns, medical authorities, and   family freedom to choose. </span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">While the WCAR ads were   precise and dignified, the Voice for the Unborn relied on strong inflammatory words   and images to inform voters and convince them to oppose Referendum 20. VFU often   used images of fetuses, or replicas of fetuses in their advertising. The most   controversial of the ads were displayed on Seattle buses and showed a picture of   a sixteen-week-old fetus with the caption &ldquo;<em>Kill Referendum 20, Not Me</em>.&rdquo;   The transit advertising agency had initially rejected the ads as &ldquo;not being up   to [their] standards,&rdquo; but compromised after VFU threatened a lawsuit. The  agency insisted that the caption was too   inflammatory so VFU changed it to &ldquo;<em>Let Him Live</em>.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53">[53]</A> The week before the election, VFU placed an ad in the Seattle Times depicting a   replica of a fetus being held in someone&rsquo;s hand with the caption &ldquo;<em>Life or Death?&rdquo;</em> above it, and &ldquo;<em>His Future&rsquo;s in Your Hands.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54"><strong>[54]</strong></A></em></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">Because of the   disturbing nature of many of their proposed ads, VFU often had difficulty   placing them. When the organization tried to purchase billboard advertisements   opposing R-20, opponents challenged them not only for the graphic materials   displayed but also for their lack of disclosure of the organization that funded   them as required under state law. A quote from a retired advertising executive   in a press release from WCAR described the billboards as &ldquo;one of the worst forms   of visual pollution &hellip; if the opponents of abortion-reform are willing to have   these reprehensible signs erected, then they should have the courage to identify   themselves.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55">[55]</A></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">The VFU ad   choices may have hurt the organization&rsquo;s overall media strategy. News articles   about the campaign sometimes focused as much on the controversy over campaign   tactics as on the issue of abortion itself. As a result, R-20&rsquo;s opponents   struggled to achieve favorable news coverage.</span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"> Meanwhile other organizations   sponsored ads in support of Referendum 20, giving the impression that the cause   of abortion reform had broad appeal. Prominent among them were organizations of   medical professionals. The Committee for Abortion Reform, a group separate from   WCAR, placed an ad in the Seattle Times that emphasized the support of R-20 by   various psychologist organizations: &ldquo;<em>The opponents of abortion reform have   argued that abortion is a social-psychological problem. Let&rsquo;s look at what the   Psychologists say about Referendum 20</em>.&rdquo; The text explained the Washington   State Psychological Association&rsquo;s stance on the issue and urged readers to &ldquo;<em>join Washington&rsquo;s Psychologists, Doctors, Nurses, Social Workers, and other   groups that have seriously considered this issue, and have endorsed Referendum   20</em>.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56">[56]</A> Similar ads appeared sponsored by mental health professionals, showing a long   list of endorsers, also ads by nurses' advocacy groups, and one by the   Washington State Public Health Association.<A title="" href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57">[57]</A></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">The reform   campaign also emphasized the support of non-medical groups, including religious   organizations. Early on, the Washington State Council of Churches, an ecumenical   body long associated with liberal positions, joined the   campaign.<A title="" href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58">[58]</A> Reverend Everett J. Jensen, the General Secretary of the Council served on   WCAR&rsquo;s executive committee. More surprising was the support of a group of Catholics who took a position at variance with their Church. The Catholics for   Individual Responsibility Concerning Abortion (CIRCA) announced that they   supported the individual&rsquo;s right to choose abortion, although they did not   support it personally. Their call for the tolerance of all views, whether   religious or not, was one of the more exciting moments of the election. <A title="" href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59">[59]</A></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">WCARs practice   of lining up endorsements from various organizations paid further dividends as   newspapers covered press conferences and turned the announcements into news   articles. Most of the <em>Seattle Times&rsquo;</em> coverage of the referendum campaign consisted of reporting on the endorsements   it received from the Washington State Nurses Association,<A title="" href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60">[60]</A> the Washington State Parents and Teachers&rsquo; Association (PTA),<A title="" href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61">[61]</A> the Disciples of Christ, the regional assembly of the Christian Church,<A title="" href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62">[62]</A> the Washington State Society of Pediatrics,<A title="" href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63">[63]</A> and many other groups. The full list of endorsements for Referendum 20 includes   more than 25 organizations.<A title="" href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64">[64]</A> The opposition campaign also gained press coverage when organizations announced   their position against Referendum 20.</span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"><strong>The   Vote</strong></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"> On November 3, 1970, abortion was   legalized by the voters of Washington State. Referendum 20 won the support with   56.49 per cent of those who voted in the 1970 general election. There were   important regional variations in the pattern of support. For the most part,   voters in counties to the west of the Cascade Mountains voted in favor of R-20,   with the exception of Lewis, Cowlitz, and Wahkiakum Counties. Voter turnout was   particularly important in King, Grays Harbor, and Pacific Counties, where more   than 70 per cent of the voters approved R-20. King County was pivotal. Yes votes exceeded No votes by a margin of more than 100,000.<A title="" href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65">[65]</A> That western Washington supported the   measure would surprise no one today, because for several decades Puget Sound   counties have carried elections for liberal candidates and socially liberal   ballot measures. For example, the recent Referendum 74 to legalize same-sex   marriage in Washington State in 2012, demonstrated that counties with the   highest density of population often determine the verdict of the election. <A title="" href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66">[66]</A></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">To the east of   the Cascades, every county opposed R-20 except for Whitman and Columbia   Counties.<A title="" href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67">[67]</A> A post-election recap letter sent to WCAR supporters   indicated that the campaign won 21 counties, eight of which did not have WCAR   campaign branches in them. WCAR lost eighteen counties.<A title="" href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68">[68]</A> As predicted by the volunteer chapter chairman in Spokane, Spokane County posed   the greatest challenge; the referendum lost by more than 11,000 votes.<A title="" href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69">[69]</A> One factor in this could have been the consistent public opposition to the   measure by Representative Hurley, who gave the impassioned floor speech about   the bill that authorized R-20. Every Senator who had a portion of Spokane County   in their district, regardless of their political party, voted against the bill   during the 1970 legislative session (see appendix 1).<A title="" href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70">[70]</A> This was nearly true for every House member with a   portion of Spokane County in their district except for Representatives A.J.    Pardini and Gerald Saling, both   Republicans. Surprisingly, despite nearly   uniform opposition by the elected representatives in the Spokane area, the <em>Spokesman-Review</em> editorial board   endorsed the ballot measure.<A title="" href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71">[71]</A> Ultimately Spokane County had the largest margin of   loss of any county in the state.<A title="" href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72">[72]</A></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">WCAR leaders   were surprised to win several counties&mdash;especially Yakima County, where R-20 led   by 2,300 votes.<A title="" href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73">[73]</A> Going into the election Yakima County was understood   to be up for grabs. The elected legislators who had Yakima County in their   district did not vote unanimously for or against R-20 in the legislature.   Senator Jim Matson (R-14) voted against the measure, while Representatives Chet   Hatfield and Marjorie Lynch, both Republicans from the 14th District,   voted for the measure. Representatives Sid Morrison, and Irving Newhouse,   Republicans who had parts of Yakima County, voted against the measure (appendix   1). The Yakima <em>Herald-Republic</em> had   issued a bold endorsement of the ballot measure that might have tipped the   balance in the face of the split views of those who represented that area. The   editorial admitted that &ldquo;Referendum 20, changing the 1909 abortion law, is   perhaps the most controversial, emotion-filled issue on the ballot.&rdquo; It cited   the large number of harmful, illegal abortions that could be prevented if   abortions were safe and legal.<A title="" href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74">[74]</A> This message and the work of volunteers from various organizations in Yakima,   including WCAR and the League of Women Voters,<A title="" href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75">[75]</A> who held community events, contributed to the   success of the measure in a &ldquo;swing&rdquo; county. </span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"> The votes that   decided the passage of R-20 did not fall within the same party lines they might   have today. The political landscape of Washington in 2012 shows that districts   represented by Democrats are predominantly west of the Cascades, and   predominantly Republican to the east.<A title="" href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76">[76]</A> However, in 1970 many urban areas of Seattle were represented by Republicans.<A title="" href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77">[77]</A> Both parties were represented in the votes for Referendum 20.</span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">The efforts of   Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform&rsquo;s grassroots campaign and message to   voters were effective. In a letter to supporters, Helen Bonds said &ldquo;the feedback   we [got was] that our campaign was &lsquo;educational&rsquo; and &lsquo;in good taste&rsquo; &hellip; the   contrast was striking in the way the two campaigns were conducted.&rdquo;<A title="" href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78">[78]</A> She was convinced that the careful message of WCAR that   emphasized abortion as a health care choice to be made by a family resonated with voters more than the controversial campaign message preferred by the   Voice for the Unborn.  WCAR&rsquo;s careful   development of its message with the input of legislators, health care providers,   clergy, its grassroots volunteers, seems to have been the key to the success of   R-20. </span></p>
	  <p><span class="arial10">Although   campaigns for legalized abortion in the 1970s are now associated in the public   mind with the Women&rsquo;s Liberation movement, this study has shown that the reality   was much more complicated. In Washington, the campaign that passed the nation&rsquo;s only abortion reform ballot measure began in the office   of a male psychologist and involved men as well as women at very stage. It was a   bipartisan effort, dependent upon Republicans at least as much as Democrats.   Essential too was the medicalization of the issue. WCAR framed this as a matter   of health and safety and won the battle for votes by demonstrating the   overwhelming support of doctors, nurses, psychologists and other health   professionals. And perhaps key to success, first in the legislature and then in   the election, was a tough set of compromises that limited a woman&rsquo;s right to choose and   turned decisions about early stage abortions into a family decision. &ldquo;Let Each   Family Have the Right to Decide&rdquo; proved to be a winning formula in 1970.</span></p>
