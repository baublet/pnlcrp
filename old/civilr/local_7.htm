		Historians have concentrated on the events and issues surrounding the 
		two sets of assassinations, providing valuable accounts of union 
		building in the 1930s and of the reform efforts initiated by Domingo and 
		Viernes forty years later, but we know little about the intervening 
		decades. &nbsp;This essay uses union records to explore the critical middle 
		period in the history of Seattle’s Cannery and Farm Labor Union, 
		affiliated in the early 1940s as Local 7 UCAPAWA and after 1950 as Local 
		37 ILWU.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">During this period, 
		the union dealt with a myriad of struggles. &nbsp;Political strife and 
		leadership shifts dominated the 1940s. As the decade waned and the 1950s 
		began, allegations of Communist activity took a heavy toll on the union, 
		leading to reorganization under a new national and a new name: ILWU 
		Local 37. Recovery from these events led to a stability of power that 
		lasted throughout the 1950s but ultimately led to a less active union.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The cannery workers’ 
		union was originally founded as the Cannery Workers’ and Farm Laborers’ 
		Union (CWFLU) Local 18257 under the American Federation of Labor (AFL). 
		From its birth, it was already rocked by conflict; in 1936, two of its 
		leaders, Aurelio Simon and Virgil Duyungan, were shot and killed 
		(presumably due to opposition from anti-union labor contractors). In 
		1937 the union left the AFL in favor of the Congress of Industrial 
		Organizations (CIO) becoming United Cannery, Agricultural, Packinghouse, 
		and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA) Local 7. The local’s maturation 
		into a powerful bargaining force was characterized by a constantly 
		shifting leadership with a wide range of political beliefs. (The early 
		history is covered in Crystal Fresco's essay <a href="cwflu.htm">
		&quot;Cannery Worker's and Farm Laborers' Union 1933-39: Their Strength in 
		Unity&quot;</a>)</font></span></p>
		<h3><font size="2">Wartime Challenges</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The outbreak of 
		World War II provided both opportunities and challenges for the young 
		labor union. Membership declined as former cannery workers enlisted or 
		took more stable jobs in defense industries. Internal disagreements 
		seemed also for a time to threaten the union. But a new set of leaders 
		and the intense bonds between the union and Filipino communities on the 
		West Coast helped the union consolidate its position. By the war’s end 
		Local 7 not only represented Seattle workers but had become the 
		bargaining agent for cannery workers up and down the coast.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Struggles over 
		leadership dominated the early years of the 1940s. In 1940 Vincent Navea 
		won the election as President of Local 7. Navea’s past gave him a 
		tenuous hold on the presidential office: he was respected as a 
		hard-working union official (he had previously been the union’s business 
		agent) and upstanding community member, but he had never worked in the 
		canneries. A great deal of conflict and intrigue surrounded Navea, as 
		his strong business sense was accompanied by constant accusations of 
		being a “company man.” These accusations were supported by his personal 
		history. He had &nbsp;previously worked for the Western Outfitting Company, 
		which appears to have been associated with the pre-union labor 
		contractors.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[3]</font></span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Navea’s successor, 
		Trinidad Rojo, was elected President of Local 7 in October 1942. Wordy, 
		intellectual, and often less than humble, he was active in union affairs 
		from the 1940s through the 1950s. Rojo espoused efficiency and 
		discipline in the union. In a 1975 interview he took credit for a series 
		of innovations and reforms, such as introducing the time clock to the 
		office, reducing gambling problems and concentrating the flow of union 
		money in the offices of the treasurer and secretary.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[4]</font></span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Like many young 
		Filipino men, Rojo came to the United States in search of educational 
		opportunities. In the Philippines high school was very expensive and it 
		was not uncommon for a full family to spend a large amount of its 
		resources to educate one child.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[5]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		The United States – to which Filipinos could immigrate freely until the 
		passing of the Tydings-McDuffie Act in 1934 – offered young Filipinos 
		the chance to be self-supporting students, taking a great weight off of 
		their families. However, many found that after gaining an education 
		there were few opportunities for Filipinos in America. This frustration 
		led many highly educated individuals to become active in labor 
		struggles. Rojo was one of them.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Rojo had succeeded 
		Navea in 1942 but there was continuing conflict between the two men and 
		their allies. &nbsp;In August 1943 an election dispute occurred relating to 
		the validity of the nomination of Irineo Cabatit for the local’s annual 
		presidential election. Membership meeting minutes show two distinct 
		groups: one composed of Navea and Cabatit, and another led by Rojo and 
		the secretary, Prudencio Mori. Cabatit had withdrawn from the election 
		over the phone but still wanted to run for president. Arguing that votes 
		should be thrown out because he was removed from the ballot, and that it 
		was constitutionally required for withdrawals to be submitted in writing 
		(and not over the phone), Cabatit was still given a chance to run as 
		president for the remainder of the voting period.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[6]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		He did not win the presidency.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Following Cabatit’s 
		defeat, Navea attempted to gain control of the union membership from the 
		outside by filing a petition to the War Labor Board asking that the 
		American Legion post that he headed (Rizal Post), be recognized as the 
		sole bargaining agent to the Alaska cannery industry.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[7]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		Most of the canneries had been consolidated under one umbrella 
		organization &nbsp;during the beginning of the war and they relied on the 
		union to seasonally dispatch workers to Alaska for the two-month summer 
		canning season. Thus, winning representation with the industry was the 
		key to controlling the cannery labor base. Navea was unsuccessful and 
		was charged with anti-union activities by the union. A small 1944 
		membership meeting vote on the matter revealed how split the membership 
		was at the time: 38 voted him guilty while 32 voted him not guilty.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[8]</font></span></span></a></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		The leadership was much different, however: an 8-1 vote by secret ballot 
		in an executive board meeting two days earlier condemned Navea to a 
		ten-year suspension.</span></font><a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[9]</font></span></span></a></span></p>
		<h3><font size="2">Consolidation</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">One can see by the 
		small vote tally that the union membership decreased dramatically during 
		the war. Between the dramatic fall of Bataan to the Japanese in April 
		1942, the draft, and the lure of non-seasonal work, the UCAPAWA locals 
		lost over a thousand workers to various military services and even more 
		to industries related to military production.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[10]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		The labor shortage had a drastic effect on the union and the salmon 
		industry in general. The government exempted many Filipino workers from 
		the draft because the supply of canned food was considered important to 
		the war effort.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Faced with this 
		challenge, Local 7 looked towards new fronts on which to represent 
		workers. Alaska cannery workers shipped out of Portland and San 
		Francisco as well as Seattle, and in those ports they were represented 
		by affiliated unions: &nbsp;Local 5 in San Francisco and Local 266 in 
		Portland, both of which dispatched predominantly Filipino workers to 
		Alaska under the same agreed-upon contracts. According to various oral 
		histories, Local 7 had the most sway with the UCAPAWA International. 
		Since the union was in charge of dispatching, it also became heavily 
		involved in the process of labor recruiting during the war, sending 
		agents to Filipino communities around the west coast to get more 
		workers. The Filipino community in Stockton, California was one of the 
		most looked-on targets. By the summer of 1944, there was talk of setting 
		&nbsp;up a year-round branch in Stockton and Local 7 President Rojo himself 
		was asked to travel there to drum up more support.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[11]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		Even after war, when the labor shortage was dramatically ended, Stockton 
		continued to remain an important to Local 7’s leaders and members, 
		largely because the seasonal nature of Alaska cannery work fit well with 
		the asparagus season in California.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">As the union 
		expanded outward in search of new members, it consolidated its three 
		locals into the one Seattle-based Local 7 based on the argument that it 
		was redundant to have three organizations negotiating with the single 
		Alaska Salmon Industry organization. The level of hostility from the 
		small southern locals to consolidation is difficult to gauge, as their 
		own records no longer exist. &nbsp;Local 266 in Portland fought not for 
		continued existence as a separate local but did demand the continued 
		operation of the office. Upon hearing that the two southern locals were 
		going to be absorbed by the Seattle one, the Portland local’s president 
		Ernesto Mangaoang traveled to Seattle to request only that the Portland 
		union hall retain some funding, explaining that &nbsp;it was an important 
		community center. In the discussion, Rojo spoke up “not as president, 
		but as one who has studied the problems of Filipinos in the United 
		States” and made Local 266 a branch of Local 7. The Seattle local also 
		killed two birds with one stone by mandating that the Portland branch 
		officers must spend several months out of the year organizing labor in 
		Stockton.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[12]</font></span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The intersection of 
		labor interests with Filipino community interests was not uncommon in 
		this union. While it did cater to some other Asian-American interests 
		(such as establishing a “Farm Committee” to aid interned 
		Japanese-American farmers in holding their land for no profit</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[13]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">), 
		it was becoming &nbsp;more and more a Filipino union. The Chinese-American 
		populations in Portland and San Francisco lost power from the 
		consolidation of the three locals and the Japanese Americans on the west 
		coast lost all representation due to internment.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[14]</font></span></span></a></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		While Filipinos had dominated the union since the beginning, the war-era 
		dramatically eroded the role of other Asian Americans. .</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">By and large, the 
		union and the Filipino community benefited from one another. Local 7 was 
		considered the most militant and active Filipino union in the United 
		States. Despite a large Filipino population that was dispersed 
		throughout both the urban and rural Pacific coast, Local 7 was seen as 
		the one place during the summer months where Filipinos in America could 
		get a job <i>en masse</i> outside of farm work. Perhaps the most 
		memorable photos of the union’s history are those of Main Street in 
		Seattle, showing a massive crowd of Filipino men waiting outside the 
		union hall to be dispatched. It would be incorrect to argue that the 
		union was the sole community center. &nbsp;Fraternities such as the 
		Caballeros de Dimas Alang and umbrella groups like Filipino Community of 
		Seattle, Inc. held massive community events as early as the mid-1920s 
		and continued to do so at least through the 1950s.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref15" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[15]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		However, the union hall was still a valuable tool for the Filipino 
		community, between annual dances, various social functions, and, of 
		course, the employment it promised.&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
		<h3><font size="2">Cold War Tensions</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Communists had been 
		involved in the union from its beginnings in the 1930s. As the Second 
		World War ended and the Cold War began, the presence of Communists in 
		the leadership of the union would usher in a decade of volatility. 
		However, unlike many unions with Communist Party ties, the Cannery 
		Workers Union would not be destroyed or severely weakened by outside 
		forces. </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The early postwar 
		years saw continued intra-union political strife that led to the 
		creation of a rival union. Immediately following the end of the war, the 
		union was characterized by dull union meetings and a highly unsuccessful 
		1946 strike under the presidency of Prudencio Mori.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[16]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		Trinidad Rojo had left at the war’s end to resume his studies but was

		Workers Union of America, which replaced UCAPAWA that year). The 
		“progressive” side (including Mori) accused some members of the union 
		leadership of being associated with the canning industry while 
		allegations of communism were already being prepared by the more 
		“conservative” side. In early 1947, during one of the heated arguments 
		resulting from this conflict, Max Gonzales, the vice president of the 
		union and a staunch anti-Communist, pulled out a revolver and shot in 
		the “general direction” of the more leftist Matias Lagunilla,</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[18]</font></span></span></a></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		disruptive issue for some time.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">While Gonzales did 
		not hurt anyone, he still submitted his resignation to the Executive 
		Council three days later. It was rejected by Mori and the rest of the 
		council on the grounds that Gonzales’ resignation would signify an

		also go on to exemplify Gonzales’ “excellent track record” of service 
		for the union,</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[19]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		<span style="font-family: Arial">The inter-union

		(also known as the Labor-Management Relations Act), passed in 1947 to 
		outlaw closed shops and require union leaders to file affidavits 
		declaring that they were not members of the Communist Party. While the 
		union and its leadership did not publicly declare any sort of Communist 
		affiliation, it was well-known within the community that Communist Party 
		members had long been active in the politics of Local 7. According to 
		Rojo, it was not uncommon for right-wing members of the politically 
		diverse Filipino community to report alleged Communists to the Bureau of 
		Immigration.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref30" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[30]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		<span style="font-family: Arial">The Seafood Workers 
		Union merged with the Alaska Fish Cannery Workers (AFCW) of the American 
		Federation of Labor (AFL) and made another attempt to undermine the 
		union.. This amalgamated organization petitioned the National Labor 
		Relations Board (NLRB) for representation elections, which were 
		subsequently approved and set for April of 1949. Local 7 was accused of 
		being a Communist union, and the election was preceded by a raid from 
		U.S. Immigration officials who arrested business agent Ernesto Mangaoang, 
		newly-elected president Chris Mensalvas, and several others on 
		accusations of being Communist.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref31" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[31]</font></span></span></a></span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Arial">While Local 7 
		sustained the attacks quite well from an organizational standpoint-- 
		winning the representation election in 1949,--the specter of Communist 
		involvement haunted the union for the next decade. Later that year the 
		FTA International was expelled by the CIO because of its ties to the 
		Communist Party. That led to yet another attempt by conservative cannery 
		workers to change the course of Local 7. Several Local 7 officers

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Local 7 then gave up 
		its affiliation with the wounded Food, Tobacco, Agricultural and Allied 
		Workers Union of America, &nbsp;finding a new parent international union in 
		the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union (ILWU). On March 
		26, 1950 the cannery workers affiliated with the ILWU and became Local 
		7-C. That summer, it won collective bargaining rights in another NLRB 
		representative election , defeating Local 77 and the Alaska Fish Cannery 
		Workers’ Union, SIU-AFL. The following year, Local 7-C signed a four

		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Why did Local 7 
		succeed against these competing unions despite the constant threat of

		aggression was at its peak and the new Taft-Hartley law was in effect, 
		attendance at May membership meetings was as high as 560 people.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref34" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[34]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		participated in community activities and were allowed to stand their 
		ground and defend themselves in open letters, public discussions, and so 
		on. While many community members whispered about rumors of Communism 
		among the union leaders, the workers were still more familiar with Local

		<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		After 1950, the threat of breakaway unions and outside unions would 
		recede. After affiliating with ILWU and becoming &nbsp;Local 37 some of the 
		turmoil diminished, but the union and its leaders faced a new set of 
		problems. On November 17, 1949 &nbsp;Ernesto Mangaoang was arrested and held 
		for deportion under the order of District Director John P. Boyd (who 
		would antagonize the union over this issue for some time) . He was 
		&nbsp;released &nbsp;eleven days later under a ruling by the District Court that 
		Boyd’s action was an abuse of discretion, but Mangaoang’s problems and 
		the union’s problems were far from over. Deportation orders and court 
		cases would dominate the next several years.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref36" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[36]</font></span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">In 1950, Congress 
		passed the McCarran Internal Security Act), requiring communists and 
		communist front organizations to register with the Attorney General and 
		allowing immigration officials to make a case to deport “subversive” 
		aliens. Under this act, Mangaoang and some thirty other Filipinos were 
		placed in jail. Mangaoang’s attorneys were not notified so he was not 
		allowed to cross-examine his witnesses. After 83 days jail, he was 
		released, and a deportation order soon followed. The case worked its way 
		up to the Supreme Court in 1953 and was concluded by an issue brought up 
		by the famous defense attorney John Caughlan, who argued that Mangaoang 
		never technically “entered” America as an alien because he traveled from 
		the Philippines while it was still an American territory.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref37" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[37]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">It can be argued 
		that the intensity and strife created by the controversy over Communism 
		and the hearings &nbsp;actually contributed to the union’s power and 
		activity. Up until the mid-1950s, leaflets and publications by the union 
		convey a strong sense of urgency to be involved and stand up for the 
		union. During the initial arrests in 1949, Matias Lagunilla formed the 
		Local 7 Defense Committee and released a large flier (click here) with 
		pictures of five leaders facing deportation (including Mensalvas and 
		Mangaoang). It proclaimed in bold text, “THEY TRY TO KILL OUR UNION”, 
		juxtaposing the Communist trials with the murders of Duyungan and Simon 
		in 1936. The first page ends with “YOU’RE NEXT, UNLESS…” followed by the 
		top of the second page: “...YOU HALT THIS DRIVE AGAINST OUR UNIONS.”</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref38" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[38]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		These sentiments were also exemplified in Local 37’s 1952 yearbook, 
		wrought with powerful language. Headlines implore workers to “Know Your 
		Rights” while various articles by the union leadership espouse a very 
		victorious and tenacious approach to the union’s recent history, 
		especially in relation to the deportation issues.</span></font><a name="_ednref39" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[39]</font></span></span></a></span></p>

		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The union also 
		actively lobbied against deportation legislation and anything related to

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">The newly renamed 
		Local 37 found itself identifying strongly with the ILWU International. 
		As the ILWU president Harry Bridges faced deportation and prison, 
		parallels were drawn between him and Local 37’s own Ernesto Mangaoang.

		However, there was little the ILWU could do for Local 37, and many of

		per year despite the fact that Local 37’s members only worked a two 
		month season. Although leaders of other locals involved in seasonal work 
		were brought in to explain why they were willing to pay the same amount

		<h3><font size="2">Dissention in the Board</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, Ernesto Mangaoang was a hero to 
		the union. Respected as an incredibly shrewd negotiator, he was defended 
		by the union all the way up to the Supreme Court. &nbsp;Yet in the fall of 
		1954, not long after winning his case, Mangaoang &nbsp;was ousted from the 
		union. The events that lead to this political intrigue resulted from a 
		general dissatisfaction in the leadership of Mensalvas and Lagunilla and 
		the involvement of the well-known Filipino author and activist, Carlos 
		Bulosan.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulosan 
		came to the United States at the onset of the Great Depression to look 
		for opportunities outside of his agrarian community. He wrote the 
		best-selling pseudo-autobiographical novel <i>America is in the Heart</i> 
		and published it as World War II began. He was well recognized as the 
		premier Filipino-American writer and befriended Chris Mensalvas while 
		Mensalvas was attempting to organize labor in California. In 1952, 
		Mensalvas invited Bulosan up to Seattle to edit Local 37’s yearbook, 
		which remains one of the most coveted pieces of the local’s history from 
		this time period, and would have a profoundly inspirational effect on 
		the activist student unionists in the 1970s</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref45" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn45"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[45]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">. 
		The yearbook (which is reprinted in its entirety on this site) was 
		significant not only because of Bulosan’s involvement, but also because 
		it was published at a turning point in the union’s history: after the 
		inter-union competition had been quelled and a string of victories had 
		been won against government forces despite the Taft-Hartley and 
		Walter-McCarran acts. As liberal organizations around the nation were 
		disappearing or morphing into something more conservative, ILWU Local 37 
		celebrated its leftist commitments unabashedly in this yearbook, 
		promoting strong positions against the Korean War, the “fascist” 
		Walter-McCarran Act, and the “stooges” in the less liberal AFL.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, 
		behind this celebration of the union’s &nbsp;militancy was a growing 
		discontent among the more moderate members. Trinidad Rojo, who was still 
		active in the council as a trustee, attacked Mensalvas in August 1953 
		for improperly using union money as president instead of confining all 
		monetary transfers to the office of the treasurer. Mensalvas had loaned 
		union money to Bulosan and had not been paid back. Bulosan had chronic 
		health issues and was hospitalized at the time. Defending him with 
		Mensalvas was Matias Lagunilla, who stated that “an injury to one is an 
		injury to all.” Mangaoang, still Business Agent, also came to his side, 
		trying to use a technicality to show that Bulosan owed nothing. Rojo 
		responded in his usually analogical manner by arguing “that is like 
		stretching a fly to cover an elephant.”</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref46" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn46"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[46]</font></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		Between the costs of all the legal defenses, the strain the local had 
		undergone fighting other unions and the lack of support from the ILWU 
		International, Local 37 was very low on money and every dollar became an 
		issue.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Rojo pinned the 
		budget problems on the leftist leadership. In November, he wrote a 
		resolution to call in the ILWU International to investigate and audit 
		Local 37’s leadership. In a board meeting, Mensalvas stated that “with 
		all its good intentions, the resolution will confuse the membership; and 
		it will make a wedge for them to come and again inject dissension.” The 
		executive board promptly condemned the resolution. Mangaoang, however, 
		disagreed, arguing that it is dangerous for the officers of a democratic 
		union to refuse to be publicly investigated. Lagunilla countered with 
		his belief that the resolution had ulterior motives and was a “dirty way 
		of eliminating officers that they cannot eliminate in the election.”</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref47" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn47"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[47]</font></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">By 1954, Mangaoang 
		was in open disagreement with the other Local 37 officers. In a February 
		membership meeting, he tried to read a speech on his stance and was 
		promptly denied the floor by Mensalvas, who said that the reading of a 
		minority opinion at a membership meeting was unprecedented (which was 
		most certainly untrue).</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref48" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn48"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[48]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lagunilla said that the 
		Business Agent is like the monkey who said to the turtle that his tail 
		is very long; yet the Business Agent failed to look back and see if he 
		has any tail at all. He said that we have nothing to do here all winter, 
		but getting drunk and solving the crossword puzzle. What is wrong with 
		solving the puzzle if there is nothing to do. Drinking after office 
		hours is not the business of anybody, much less the Business Agent he 
		said. He fails to include in his leaflet that he stayed in the Casino 
		all winter playing rummy, coming only to the office to claim his weekly 
		check. No wonder the Business Agent has so many claims not settled. Now 
		the Business Agent resort to arbitration which means the expenditure of 
		a lot of money.</font><a name="_ednref49" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[49]</font></span></span></a><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

		<span style="font-family: Arial">The next day, 
		Mangaoang finally had the chance to speak in a membership meeting on the 
		topic, probably because his leaflet had already been well-circulated 
		among the membership. The same arguments were expressed and hashed out. 
		Directly following that Mensalvas called for the nomination of officers 
		for the upcoming election. Mangaoang’s name did not appear in any 
		category.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref50" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn50"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[50]</font></span></span></a></span></p>

		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">A trial committee 
		was formed among the membership to address the allegations about both 
		Mangaoang (for creating dissension) and the other officers of Local 37. 
		At the June meeting as the committee began presenting findings and 
		resolutions, matters became so heated that &nbsp;members were shouting at one

		<h3><font size="2">Financial Problems</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Regardless of 
		whether &nbsp;Mensalvas and his cohorts were guilty of acting irresponsibly 
		with the budget, the union was still having financial difficulties. It 
		was constantly digging into the burial fund, taking out loans of five or 
		six thousand dollars at a time. At the July 1954 meeting it was 
		announced that the budget had a deficit of around $15,000.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref53" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn53"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[53]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		The union also received notice from the office of John Caughlan, who had 
		represented Mensalvas and Mangaoang when they were under threat of 
		deportation, that Mensalvas’ $5,000 bail had finally been refunded to 
		the attorneys but would not be returned to the union until the attorneys 
		themselves were paid by the union. A resolution was passed in a February 
		membership meeting stating that the local did not make any commitment to 
		pay and the money should be returned in full.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref54" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[54]</font></span></span></a></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		By March, the executive council was mortgaging the union building

		The conflict with Caughlan was drawn out for the next few years as the 
		union continued to borrow money. Another eighteen thousand dollars was 
		borrowed from the burial fund in December 1956 as Mensalvas reported 
		that only $700 of his $5000 bail had been refunded.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref56" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn56"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[56]</font></span></span></a></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Local 37’s records 
		from 1957 are missing, and records from 1958 are very spotty; however, 
		the records that remain point to some resolution, or at least a leveling

		board meetings focus more on union involvement in community events than 
		on the financial issues that dominated the mid-50s discussions.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">While membership

		While there may be other factors involved (perhaps the dispatching 
		became more staggered that year), the numbers still point to a less 
		active membership.</span></font></span></p>
		<h3><font size="2">A New Conservative Era</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">In 1959, Mensalvas 
		went to Canada to meet with the Soviets at a labor conference. On the 
		way back, the Department of Immigration challenged his return to the 
		country, arguing that he lacked &nbsp;U.S. citizenship. He somehow made it to 
		Seattle with the aid of his attorney, but then quickly left to Hawaii 
		and stayed there for several years. The details of his departure are 
		unclear. &nbsp;Years later when interviewed for an oral history, &nbsp;Mensalvas 
		briefly touched on this part of his life, saying that the “political 
		question” in Seattle affected his decision to go to Hawaii.</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref59" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn59"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[59]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
		What he meant by “political question” is not clear though this time was 
		marked by a distinct change in organizational structure, which may have 
		been what Mensalvas was referring to. The union had moved to consolidate 
		the offices of the president and the business agent into one. Gene 
		Navarro, who had been the business agent since Mangaoang’s departure, 
		had become president by Mensalvas’ return to Seattle in 1963. Navarro 
		would remain in office with a more moderate, or even conservative, 
		ideology that would last until the 1980s.</span></font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Why Navarro and not 
		Lagunilla or another individual closer to the political orientation of 
		Mensalvas? Why, after years of staving off anticommunist assaults, did 
		the union chose a more conservative leadership so late, in 1960? &nbsp;The 
		records do not provide a clear answer. Perhaps Gene Navarro was simply 
		in the right place at the right time to maneuver for a more powerful 
		position. What few records of meetings or elections in 1960 remain 
		discuss little more than day-to-day business, so it is difficult to 
		tell.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<font size="2">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Whatever the case, 
		the Mensalvas era ended with this single event. Mensalvas would continue 
		to play an advisory role to the union until his death in 1978</span></font><span style="font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref60" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn60"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[60]</font></span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">, 
		but he did not make significant direct contributions to union activity 
		after 1959.</span></font></span></p>
		<h3><font size="2">The Question of Stability</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">It is difficult to 
		ascertain why Mensalvas was able to remain president of the local 
		throughout the entirety of the 1950s. It is not uncommon to draw 
		connections in labor history between Communist elements of a union and 
		heightened participation among rank and file members. &nbsp;But once 
		Mensalvas had established his power, the membership became less active, 
		not more. This lack of activity may have kept him in power, but may have 
		ultimately undermined the support he needed to sustain his progressive 
		leadership agenda.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">One might also argue 
		that the stability of Mensalvas’ power lay in the fact that the union’s 
		conflicts were less glamorous in the 1950s than in the 1940s. All CIO 
		locals had to deal with the Taft-Hartley law and there was a sense that 
		everyone was in it together. Moreover, Mensalvas was able to use the 
		dissent caused by fighting with the Gonzales/Briones faction and, later, 
		the “red-free” Navea faction, to portray himself as a hero who used his 
		skilled oratory to stand up against the “AFL stooges.” The conflicts of 
		the 1950s were dirty, and generated political controversy over Communist 
		allegations and the heated personal dissension between old friends like 
		Mensalvas and Mangaoang. &nbsp;Following 1952, union survival was no longer 
		in doubt, and these struggles lost their life-and-death tone.</font></span></p>
		<h3><font size="2">Conclusion</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in" align="left">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Local 37 was not a 
		massive union, nor was it a very well-known union outside of the 
		Filipino community at this time. ILWU histories pay little attention to 
		it in comparison to other locals and its successes during this era are 
		generally not celebrated in labor history. However, it was extremely 
		significant to Filipino Americans in an era when discrimination 
		prevented them access to most other jobs. Equal opportunity employment 
		would not become government policy until the 1960s, but the labor union 
		prevailed as a source of employment for the disenfranchised Filipino 
		Americans for decades before that, The cannery union also played a very 
		important role in the economics, politics, and social dynamics of the 
		Seattle Filipino community, and beyond that &nbsp;the Filipino American 
		community as a whole. The tone of its struggles, from the manner in 
		which it settled infighting to its unique successes against Communist 
		allegations, reveals a union solidified by ethnic identity. In contrast 
		to the rest of American society, one’s status as Filipino American was 
		an advantage in this organization, and it fostered a Filipino American 
		identity that would be celebrated for decades to come in both Filipino 
		American and labor history.</font></span></p>
