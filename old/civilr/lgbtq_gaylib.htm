	  <span class="arial10"> Non-normative sexuality has long been part of the social fabric of Seattle.  In the late nineteenth, cases of sodomy were common in a city had a large transient male population and relatively few women.  The Washington State Legislature passed a bill making sodomy illegal in 1893 with the increased publicity of homosexuality in the region.  While documentation of homosexual behavior extends back into Seattle’s early history as an American city, the standard markers of a gay community did not come into being until the 1930s. </span></p>
    <p class="arial10">Establishments serving gay or sexually curious clientele were predominantly located in Pioneer Square and Downtown until the gay liberation movement allowed gay culture to move from the margins of the city to the mainstream.  Gay men and women could go to bars and bathhouses in these areas without fear of being found out by employers or family members.  The Double Header, considered by many to be the oldest continuously operating gay bar in the United States, opened its doors in 1934 and continues to do business in Pioneer Square.. </p>
    <p class="arial10">While the homophile movement gained traction in Los Angeles and San Francisco in the 1950s and 1960s, Seattle’s first and only homophile organization, the Dorian Society, did not form until 1967.  While bar owners in Seattle had been subject to police payoffs, one effect of the payoffs was the freedom from moral policing in bars as long as the owners paid up.  Physically violent policing of gay communities was common in cities that were centers of homophile activism.  As a result, homophile organizing only began when activists from other cities moved to Seattle.   </p>
    <p class="arial10">Soon after the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City symbolically launched the gay liberation movement in the United States, many Seattle activists adopted the discourse and tactics of gay liberation.  The Seattle chapter of the Gay Liberation Front formed in 1970, and Seattle was one of a handful of cities to commemorate the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots.  To this day, Seattle celebrates Gay Pride Week the same week as the Stonewall riots at the end of June along with New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.  Seattle Counseling Services for Sexual Minorities began providing psychological services for gay men and lesbians in 1969.  Seattle’s first Gay Community Center was founded in 1971.  The Union of Sexual Minorities carried the ethos of gay liberation through the end of the 1970s, raising awareness around sexual discrimination as well as racism and imperialism. </p>
    <p class="arial10  style2">The Seattle City Council was quicker than most municipal governments in acknowledging and passing protections for the gay community on the heels of gay liberation.  The city adopted an employment nondiscrimination ordinance protecting sexual minorities in 1973 and a housing nondiscrimination ordinance in 1975.  Following these protections for sexual minorities, more and more venues catering to the gay community, including bars and bathhouses, began opening on Capitol Hill, where many gay people were already living.  </p>
