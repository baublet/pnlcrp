font-family:Arial">In 1970, an American Indian couple that had tried 
	unsuccessfully to find work in Alaska arrived in Seattle to continue their 
	search.&nbsp; They were penniless, lived in their car with their two children, 
	and had no food and no idea what to do.&nbsp; They were unaware of any services 
	the government and other assistance agencies could offer them.<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Many American Indians who migrated from reservations to Seattle in search of 
	work during the 20th century suffered a similar plight, living in deep 
	poverty and enduring great difficulties adjusting to urban life.&nbsp; These 
	difficulties were often due to inadequacies in healthcare and education, 
	unemployment, and being disconnected from their communities and cultures.&nbsp; 
	Also, few people outside the American Indian community knew of their 
	plight.&nbsp; Non-Indians knew little about Indian culture and often harbored 
	negative stereotypes of American Indians.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Founded in 1958 in Seattle, the American Indian Women's 
	Service League (AIWSL) was the first organization in Seattle dedicated 
	towards tackling the problems of urban Indians.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stated purpose of the 
	American Indian Women's Service League was to “deal with critical situations 
	within the scope of women's activities— those affecting children, health, 
	housing, etc.”<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	However, the AIWSL went far beyond the scope of a charitable organization 
	involving “women’s” activities. It raised public consciousness of important 
	urban Indian issues, brought Indian cultural traditions to the city, built a 
	sense of community among Seattle Indians, and started an expansive network 
	of essential social service organizations dedicated to helping urban 
	Indians.&nbsp; Their hard work and dedication improved the lives and image of 
	urban American Indians in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">A number of political and economic circumstances drove 
	American Indians to move off the reservations and into urban settings like 
	Seattle, in search of seasonal or full-time work.&nbsp; Indians had long migrated 
	through American cities for commerce and social reasons.&nbsp; Puget Sound and 
	other Northwest Indians, after first moving to reservations, were permitted 
	to travel between reservations and outside them in search of work, making 
	Seattle a crucial cultural and trading meeting place for indigenous people.&nbsp; 
	Pacific Northwest Indians, who had relied on primarily on fishing and 
	hunting for centuries, found it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves 
	with these occupations alone, and found reservation resources and federal 
	programs insufficient in helping them adapt to agricultural or other forms 
	of work.&nbsp; This resulted in deep poverty and poor living conditions, often 
	resulting in no option but to move off the reservation in search of a better 
	life.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">World War II began a great economic boom in Seattle and the 
	demand for labor greatly increased.&nbsp; Many Indians in the Pacific Northwest, 
	as well as from all regions around the country, migrated to Seattle to work 
	in the aerospace, shipyard, and military support industries, as well as to 
	serve in the armed forces at Seattle-area bases.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	After the war, many former Indian soldiers did not return to the 
	reservations and instead sought work in the Seattle area.&nbsp; But as the 
	economic boom slowed, jobs became scarcer.&nbsp; Many urban Seattle Indians were 
	left displaced and jobless, taking up residence in Seattle’s Skid Road, a 
	working class neighborhood around Pioneer Square that catered to transient 
	workers. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Before the 1950s, Indians in Seattle were not formally 
	organized.&nbsp; When American Indian issues received local attention, it was 
	mostly at the behest of non-Indian churches and civic organizations.&nbsp; Among 
	the volunteers were a number of middle-class American Indian women who 
	helped less fortunate Indians on an informal basis, taking them into their 
	homes and providing the help they needed in emergency situations.&nbsp; Pearl 
	Warren, a Makah originally from Neah Bay, organized seven of these women 
	together to form the American Indian Women's Service League (AIWSL) in 
	1958.&nbsp; The organization quickly grew to more than 50 members by the fall of 
	1958, with members from throughout the Northwest and even the Plains.<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Warren and other members of the service league saw the 
	immediate need for a place for local Indians to congregate, find a sense of 
	community, and receive the culturally appropriate help and services they 
	needed.&nbsp; Warren believed it was important to have a “hospitality center” for 
	Indians that would accomplish the following goals:&nbsp; “(1) be a friendly place 
	for Indians to meet, (2) give assistance to Indians who are not acquainted 
	with the city ways of living, (3) refer those with educational medical or 
	other problems to proper channels for advice, (4) and very important, 
	preserve our Indian culture.”<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Warren and the AIWSL sent letters to service organizations 
	throughout the country, and by 1960 they had raised the funds to open the 
	Seattle Indian Center in a small building downtown.&nbsp; The center expanded 
	over the years and became a place where urban Indians could feel at home, 
	express their culture, and improve themselves.&nbsp; In fact, it was the first 
	place many Indians went to when they first arrived in Seattle (sometimes 
	because AIWSL members waited at the bus station to welcome new arrivals).<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The Indian Center also became the launching pad for numerous social service 
	programs and committees sponsored by AIWSL members.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Pearl Warren became the first Executive Director of the 
	Indian Center.&nbsp; During her 11-year term there, she launched and expanded 
	many of the programs and services provided by the Indian Center, 
	particularly as federal War on Poverty funding became available.&nbsp; She 
	educated the community and furthered the cause of improving the lives of 
	urban Indians through her involvement in schools, church groups, and civic 
	organizations, as well as through other committees such as the Seattle and 
	Puget Sound Environmental Health Council.&nbsp; She was elected Assistant 
	Secretary of the Seattle Model Cities Program, and chaired the national 
	organization, Americans Indians United.&nbsp; She was the only Indian to testify 
	about the plight of urban Indians before U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy's 
	Committee on Indian Education.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Pearl Warren and the AIWSL made public relations an important 
	part of their goal to “make Indians part of the community they live in, and 
	to get non-Indians to recognize us as an Indian group.”<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Indians were portrayed by the national mainstream media, as well as in 
	Seattle community events, as figments of the past.&nbsp; Indians also had 
	relatively small numbers compared to other racial and ethnic groups in 
	Seattle, making up less than one percent of the city’s total population according 
	to the 1960 U.S. Census.
	<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9">
	<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The AIWSL strived to increase visibility for Seattle Indians 
	by appearing as guest speakers and giving presentations on Indian culture to 
	non-Indian groups.&nbsp; The organization also sponsored community and cultural 
	events, such as fundraising dinners and dances featuring traditional Indian 
	dancers from many tribes.&nbsp; AIWSL members publicized these events in print, 
	radio, and television to a non-Indian audience.&nbsp; Due to these efforts, the 
	first North American Indian Jamboree and Benefit Ball held by the AIWSL in 
	1961 attracted more than a thousand people.<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Their annual salmon bake on Alki Point became very popular, attracting more 
	than a thousand people annually.&nbsp; These efforts not only raised funds for 
	the AIWSL, but they also made Indians a visible, recognized, and celebrated 
	part of the wider Seattle community.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">To further promote public awareness of issues and events 
	affecting American Indians in the Pacific Northwest, the AIWSL began 
	publishing a small monthly newsletter the <i>Indian Center News</i> in 
	1960.&nbsp; In only five years, the <i>Indian Center News</i>’s circulation 
	expanded to include subscribers throughout and beyond the Pacific Northwest, 
	as well as government officials, public institutions such as universities 
	and libraries, and other Indian organizations.<a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The editorial staff was comprised of AIWSL and Indian Center volunteers, who 
	wrote and compiled much of the newsletter’s content.&nbsp; In 1971, the paper 
	started being published as the <i>Northwest Indian News</i> in an expanded 
	newsprint format, reaching more than 2,600 subscribers. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The <i>Indian Center News</i> and <i>Northwest Indian News</i> 
	promoted a sense of community among the diverse, geographically dispersed 
	Indian population of the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; Unlike other groups in Seattle 
	categorized by race or ethnicity, Seattle Indians were dispersed throughout 
	the city.&nbsp; They also varied widely with respect to economic class, ranging 
	from homeless to working class to middle-class, and came from many tribes in 
	the Northwest as well as from around the country.&nbsp; These publications 
	reached out to all Indians and the Pacific Northwest, transcending tribal, 
	geographic, and economic lines, and provided a means of communication 
	between the cities and the reservations.&nbsp; A monthly events calendar kept the 
	community up to date and encouraged all Indians to come together and become 
	involved in organizational and committee meetings, cultural events, and 
	youth activities.&nbsp; The papers even urged readers to contribute articles, 
	giving all Indians an opportunity to voice their concerns.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">To further build a sense of community among Pacific Northwest 
	Indians, each issue of the <i>Indian Center News</i> featured a “From the 
	Teepees” section (“Teepee Talk” in the <i>Northwest Indian News</i>), with 
	personal news straight from the homes of local Indians.&nbsp; This was a forum 
	for women in the community to announce special events, such as marriages, 
	births, college graduations, or even day-to-day happenings, such as an older 
	woman enjoying the company of her grandchildren.&nbsp; This gave an opportunity 
	for Indian women to show a sense of pride in their personal accomplishments 
	or those of their families and friends, and to keep in touch with each other 
	through print.&nbsp; The author of this column, Ella Aquino, one of the AIWSL’s 
	founders, eventually brought her column to the radio on the local station 
	KRAB.<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The <i>Indian Center News</i> and <i>Northwest Indian News
	</i> also educated the public 
	about important issues affecting Indians, and provided helpful information.&nbsp; 
	The newspapers educated their readers about local and national government 
	policies and current legislation affecting American Indians, and encouraged 
	Indians to become politically involved.&nbsp; The <i>Northwest Indian News </i>
	published a series of articles about US history told from an American Indian 
	perspective.&nbsp; Monthly columns offered advice on legal issues such as 
	landlord-tenant law, the legal rights of arrested persons, and where to 
	receive free or low-cost legal help.&nbsp; The papers also publicized programs 
	and opportunities that helped Indians receive adequate healthcare and 
	education.&nbsp; Articles and columns such as these promoted public awareness of 
	Indian issues among Indians and non-Indians alike, and helped local Indians 
	learn about and gain access to much-needed social services.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most important causes the AIWSL championed was 
	education.&nbsp; The League saw education as being most critical to the 
	well-being and the future of American Indians, and the best way to overcome 
	poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Indian Center News </i>and <i>Northwest Indian News</i> 
	repeatedly reported widespread educational problems, though it seemed to 
	focus its attention on the social uplift of Indian students rather than the 
	politics of developing a culturally appropriate and relevant education in 
	Seattle’s schools.&nbsp; The papers discussed issues such as absenteeism and late 
	enrollment, which led to high school dropout rates of 18 to 21.8 percent 
	among Indian students in the 1960’s.<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Educational difficulties were also due to a living environment in some Indian 
	communities which involved deep poverty, alcoholism, overcrowding, and lack 
	of parental involvement.&nbsp; Many Indian families could not teach their children 
	the types of skills and discipline necessary to succeed in public schools. They also did not understand the necessity and importance of high 
	school and possibly postsecondary education in securing a future for their 
	children.<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></a></span>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The AIWSL recognized the importance of these educational 
	challenges and made it a priority to help Indian students succeed in 
	school.&nbsp; During the 1960s, an AIWSL education committee started a study hall 
	program at the Indian Center, where volunteer tutors assisted many Indian 
	students of all ages with their homework.&nbsp; The AIWSL also started the Indian 
	Center preschool  so that young Indian children 
	could get a head start on reading, listening, group cooperation, and other 
	important skills needed to succeed in the public school system.<a name="_ednref15" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The Indian Center also provided educational and career counseling.&nbsp; It 
	provided a successful GED class each year to help Indians receive their high 
	school diploma.&nbsp; The AIWSL's dedication to educational programs resulted in 
	a higher quality education and increased opportunities for many young 
	Indians throughout the Pacific Northwest.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Another problem that plagued the Seattle Indian community was 
	unemployment, which was at 45 percent among American Indians nationally in 
	1965.<a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Many Indians lacked the education and skills to be successful in the 
	workplace. To help Indians beyond high school and into their careers, 
	several members of the AIWSL, along with other professional Indians in the 
	community, formed the American Indian Professional Association (AIPA).&nbsp; 
	Their members were successful in fields such as electrical engineering, 
	interior design, law, and dentistry.&nbsp; Their goal was “to help Individual 
	Indians make a place for themselves in the Business World.”<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">To help Indians become successful in the workforce, the AIPA 
	promoted and stressed the importance of education and job-training among 
	young Indians, and created and spread awareness of scholarship 
	opportunities.&nbsp; They looked for job opportunities geared toward American 
	Indians, and emphasized the field of Indian arts and crafts that allowed 
	them to express their cultures and creativity.&nbsp; Lydia Johnson, a Nez Perce 
	and Cayuse, explained the reasoning behind these programs when she wrote 
	that “...it is ridiculous to expect in Indian to be content…with an 
	assembly-line job so different from the individualistic creativity Indians 
	are familiar with.”<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The AIPA helped many Indians receive the education and training they needed, 
	and instilled in their community a sense of pride and a desire to become 
	successful in the workforce.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Another way in which the AIWSL increased job opportunities 
	for Indians was by turning its own volunteers into paid employees.&nbsp; Warren 
	was able to parlay her organization’s success and community recognition 
	toward increased fundraising which allowed her and some of her core 
	volunteers to finally receive paid employment through the Center.&nbsp; And as 
	their programs expanded, other staff, such as the education counselors and 
	preschool teachers, were hired and paid for their services as well.&nbsp; This 
	provided a new means for local Indian women to enter the workforce, as many 
	female Indian Center employees had significant leadership experience, but no 
	previous employment experience outside the home.&nbsp; These entry-level 
	positions served as a “training ground” in the expanding social services 
	field, paving the way for advancement to more prestigious positions in other 
	organizations.<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Another problem that heavily concerned the AIWSL and the 
	Indian Center was the poor health conditions suffered by urban Indians.&nbsp; 
	Most Indians had no health insurance, and suffered disproportionately high 
	rates of debilitating diseases such as tuberculosis, diabetes, and hepatitis<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>.&nbsp; 
	The AIWSL began addressing this health crisis by starting a referral service 
	for Indians that could help prevent, diagnose, and treat disease.&nbsp; The work 
	of their health-related committees led to the formation of the Seattle 
	Indian Health Board (SIHB), which still exists today.&nbsp; In 1970, the SIHB 
	established a free clinic at the Seattle Public Health Hospital staffed by 
	volunteer physicians, providing a variety of services including pediatric 
	care, family planning, and even dentistry.&nbsp; Demonstrating both the demand 
	for the services as well as the diversity of Seattle’s Indian population, 
	the free clinic served over 1,100 patients from more than 100 tribes 
	throughout the United States and Canada during its first 16 months of 
	operation,.<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Throughout the run of <i>Northwest Indian News</i>, 
	alcoholism was a recurring theme and cause for concern in American Indian 
	family life.&nbsp; In 1973, the <i>Northwest Indian News </i>claimed that an 
	estimated one out of four Seattle Indians was an alcoholic.<a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The imprisonment of Indians due to alcohol- and drug-related crimes further 
	tore apart families and the community.&nbsp; In 1961, League members and Indian 
	Center volunteers established an Indian Center Alcoholics Anonymous group to 
	combat this problem.&nbsp; Later, the SIHB established the more formalized  Seattle Indian Alcoholism Program at the Indian 
	Center.&nbsp; This program was staffed by Indians who were recovering alcoholics 
	and counselors, and provided further supports and treatment for alcoholics 
	in the Indian community.&nbsp; The <i>Northwest Indian News</i> also featured a 
	monthly “Facts About Alcoholism” column to provide information about 
	alcoholism-related resources and education for the Seattle Indian community.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Though the League itself was more social service oriented 
	than protest oriented, it also nurtured a burgeoning sense of Indian 
	activism that outgrew the organization itself.&nbsp; Indian Center volunteer 
	Bernie Whitebear of the Colville tribe organized an occupation of Fort 
	Lawton in an attempt to seize the land in 1970 on behalf of all of Seattle’s 
	urban Indians.&nbsp; More than a hundred Indians took part in this 
	demonstration.&nbsp; While the AIWSL did not participate directly, many of its 
	members supported this movement from behind the scenes, bringing the 
	demonstrators food and drink when needed, and publicizing the cause in the
	<i>Indian Center News</i>.<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This demonstration led to the founding of a new political and social service 
	organization to promote the cause of urban Indians that many AIWSL members 
	also took part in: the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation (UIATF).&nbsp; 
	Several years later, the UIATF built the Daybreak Star Center at Discovery 
	Park, a cultural facility for urban Indians.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The AIWSL also believed strongly in preserving and exposing 
	others to traditional American Indian culture through the arts.&nbsp; In her 
	columns in <i>Indian Center News </i>and <i>Northwest Indian News</i>,<i>
	</i>AIWSL member Maxine Cushing Gray encouraged the Seattle Indian community 
	to “do-it-yourself in the arts,”<a name="_ednref24" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a> 
	pointing out that “Indian” art and souvenirs sold locally were often 
	inauthentic and manufactured in other countries, and Indian dances at 
	Seattle events such as Seafair were performed by non-Indians.&nbsp; The Indian 
	Center began sponsoring arts and crafts shows in the Seattle Center 
	featuring baskets, totems, dolls, jewelry, and paintings by Indian artists 
	(including some AIWSL members) from the Northwest and Alaska.&nbsp; The League 
	founded its own Indian arts and crafts store in the Indian Center, now 
	called Traditions and Beyond.&nbsp; The AIWSL also established an Indian cultural 
	presence in Seattle at community events by sponsoring Indian-led traditional 
	dance classes and exhibitions as well as fashion shows featuring local 
	Indian clothing designers and models.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">AIWSL members also served the cultural needs of the urban 
	Indian community, while raising funds, by publishing a cookbook. The AIWSL 
	compiled favorite recipes of their members and friends into a book, <i>Old 
	and New Indian Recipes</i>.&nbsp; The types of traditional recipes contained in 
	the book illustrated Northwest Indians’ cultural traditions relating to food 
	and their relationship to their surrounding environment.&nbsp; The great number 
	and variety of seafood, wild meat, and poultry recipes indicated that 
	Northwest Indian tribes primarily hunted, gathered, and fished for their 
	food, and were not agricultural in nature.&nbsp; This was an example of how 
	threatening and taking away hunting and fishing rights, and forcing Indians 
	onto agricultural reservation lands, was a threat to their traditional way 
	of life.&nbsp; <i>Old and New Indian Recipes </i>was the AIWSL’s way of helping 
	to preserve and share these culinary cultural traditions among Indians and 
	non-Indians alike, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of 
	hunting and fishing to their culture.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Also among the pages of <i>Old and New Indian Recipes</i> 
	were helpful hints for daily life.&nbsp; One section contains tips for preparing 
	traditional American Indian foods with modern kitchen appliances and 
	tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggestions for maintaining an efficient modern household included 
	techniques for laundry and cleaning.&nbsp; This recipe book, and the recipes and 
	advice it contained, preserved American Indian cultural traditions while 
	furthering the service league's goal of helping Indian households transition 
	to a modern urban lifestyle.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">In 1970, the AIWSL also kept Indian cultural traditions alive 
	in modern cities by sponsoring <i>Indian Legends</i>, a 34-page collection 
	of traditional Indian stories contributed by Indians from fifteen North 
	American tribes.&nbsp; <i>Indian Legends </i>featured tales of various adventures 
	of people and animals, many of which taught a “moral” or lesson important to 
	the Indians’ system of values.&nbsp; Several stories were about the origins of 
	traditional Indian crafts, such as basketry and bread-making.&nbsp; A federal 
	grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities made it possible to 
	purchase 250 copies of the <i>Indian Legends</i> and distribute them to 
	schools, colleges, libraries, and other public institutions.<a name="_ednref25" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<i>Indian Legends</i> served as an important means of passing on cultural 
	traditions to Indian children, as well as an educational tool for non-Indian 
	teachers and students nationwide.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Over the years, the American Indian Women's Service League 
	made a positive difference in the lives of thousands of American Indians, 
	easing their transition to urban life and helping them become successful.&nbsp; 
	The AIWSL helped several generations of American Indian children succeed in 
	school and beyond, improved access and quality of healthcare, and provided a 
	means for American Indians to express and celebrate their culture.&nbsp; Due to 
	the efforts of the AIWSL and the Indian Center, the penniless family living 
	out of its car was able to find a two-bedroom apartment, financial 
	assistance, clothing, and job training.<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This is one of many success stories attributed to the AIWSL and the many 
	spin-off organizations it started. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">&nbsp;What began as a small organization of seven Indian women 
	continued to expand and branch out over the years; in 2002, the AIWSL’s 
	Seattle Indian Center, the SIHB, and the UIATF together employed over 250 
	people and had an annual budget of over $8 million.<a name="_ednref27" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Due to decades of hard work and dedication and the lasting legacy of the 
	American Indian Women's Service League, any American Indian in Seattle will 
	continue be able to find, according to Collville tribe and AIWSL members 
	Harvey Davis and Nellie M. Davis:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:10px">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Food if he was hungry.<br>
	A friend if he was friendless.<br>
	Shoes if he was barefoot.<br>
	Sympathy and advice if he was troubled.<br>
	Thrown out if he was drunk.<br>
	Returned to his people if he was lost.<br>
	A quiet place to sit and read or contemplate.<br>
	Free clothing on Thursdays.<br>
	An opportunity to help our less fortunate tribesmen.
