		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Real American</i> 
		was a weekly paper by published by Hugh Howell in the small coastal town 
		of Hoquiam, Washington.&nbsp; Published between 1922 and 1924(?), the stated 
		purpose of the paper was to serve as a “National paper for Indians and 
		their Friends.”&nbsp; The pages of the newspaper carried a wide-range of 
		content, including news about local cultural events, the national 
		struggle of Native Americans, and numerous advertisements.&nbsp; Little is 
		known about Hugh Howell, the editor, but articles from the newspaper 
		suggest he was a member of a local tribe, as were the rest of the four 
		members of the editorial staff.&nbsp; Erin Plummer’s paper argues <i>The Real 
		American</i> advanced a pan-Indian agenda, by connecting and informing 
		local Indians in Western Washington with national news about native 
		struggle.&nbsp; In addition to this political content, throughout the 1924 
		editions, the paper focused heavily on local cultural events, 
		particularly a local beauty contest.&nbsp; Some of these articles have been 
		included on this page.&nbsp;</span></p>

font-family:Arial">Editions of the <i>Real American</i> newspaper published from 
		May to July, 1924 chronicle many of the issues facing the Native 
		American community of Washington, as well as the Native American 
		communities around the United States during the early 20th century.&nbsp; 
		Published in Hoquiam, Washington, the <i>Real American</i> primarily 
		served as a news source for the Native Americans of the Northwest, yet 
		on several occasions, articles appeared about the Native American 
		community in the Southwest and other parts of the United States.&nbsp; The 
		newspaper sympathetically described the struggles of Native Americans 
		and gave light to the idea of a Native American community that 
		transcended tribal barriers.&nbsp; The name of the newspaper, <i>Real 
		American, </i>gives the sense that writers and intended readers of the 
		newspaper felt they were the only people who could truly be called 
		Americans.&nbsp; Even if others took this title, it only rightfully belonged 
		to them.&nbsp; Through its use of sympathetic articles and its discussion of 
		American authenticity, the <i>Real American</i> newspaper promoted 
		solidarity among all Native groups and encouraged the construction of a 
		community based upon common indigenous heritage.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Each issue of the <i>Real American</i> from May to July of 
		1924 featured sections for each of the sub-communities of the Hoquiam 
		area.&nbsp; These sections provided a way for the individuals in each 
		particular community to make announcements.&nbsp; For example, in the May 22, 
		1924 issue, the first line of the section entitled “Aberdeen News” read, 
		“The stork was a recent visitor to the Chenois family, leaving a lusty 
		ten-pound papoose.”<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		This clearly illustrates the newspaper’s desire to bring together the 
		Native American community of Washington State.&nbsp; Announcements like these 
		also gave the community a chance to take a break from the harsh 
		realities that were occurring all around them—political issues, etc.—and 
		share the excitement and joy felt by their fellow community members.&nbsp; By 
		facilitating the publication of news from each sub-community, the <i>
		Real American</i> gave its readers and community members the feeling 
		they were part of a larger community.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, this sense of community extended well beyond the 
		boundaries of Washington State.&nbsp; An article in the May 15 issue about 
		the Navajo sympathetically described the tribe’s battle with the 
		government over their right to perform medicine dances.&nbsp; In the article, 
		the author writes, “There is mourning on the Navajo Reservation in 
		Arizona; for the Great White Father in Washington has frowned upon 
		medicine dances.”<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Underscoring the importance of the issue, this article was featured on 
		the cover of the paper and filled the entire page.&nbsp; Although the Navajo 
		were hundreds of miles away from the Hoquiam area, by highlighting such 
		an article in the <i>Real American,</i> the editor hoped to bridge the 
		gap between Native Americans of different tribes and different 
		geographical locations.&nbsp; Articles like this one gave readers an 
		opportunity to share stories with tribes from far away places and feel a 
		connection with the peoples of those places who were undergoing these 
		struggles.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article about the Navajo not only shows the newspaper’s 
		effort to help form a Native American community by bridging gaps between 
		tribes, it also demonstrates efforts to preserve Native American 
		customs.&nbsp; In the Navajo article, the newspaper described one tribe’s 
		fight to maintain their traditional methods of healing.&nbsp; Another article 
		in the May 22 issue of the <i>Real American</i> talked about the 
		extinction of the Indian tepee style of housing.&nbsp; The article argued 
		that Native Americans were becoming more and more likely to live in the 
		‘white man’s house’ than the traditional Native American wigwam.&nbsp; The 
		newspaper chose to include these struggles in the news it reported in 
		order to bring the community together and create a sense of urgency in 
		protecting their Native American heritage.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the colonial days until the present time, the Indian 
		population has fluctuated.&nbsp; Many Native American communities were 
		completely wiped out while others maintained some population.&nbsp; The 
		Pueblo Indians in New Mexico were just one of the many tribes that 
		struggled to keep their tribe alive.&nbsp; The <i>Real American</i> 
		chronicled the struggles of the Pueblo tribe:<i> </i>“Members of the 
		oldest civilization extant in America are now battling for life against 
		a combination of desperate odds.”<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		This article detailed the dangers facing the Pueblos, namely the ongoing 
		efforts of white settlers to seize tribal lands and threat of disease.&nbsp; 
		The <i>Real American</i> may have intended to warn its readers that they 
		too could face struggles similar to those of tribes like the Pueblos.&nbsp; 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articles about population numbers were not always so 
		depressing.&nbsp; Although several tribes lived under threat of encroachment 
		and disease, the overall population of Indians in the United States was 
		steadily increasing in the 1920s.&nbsp; The May 15, 1924 issue covered the 
		growing number of Native Americans in the United States and also the 
		growing number of Native American children in school.&nbsp; These articles 
		were meant to inspire hope in Native American communities.&nbsp; Native 
		Americans as a whole were keeping their population alive and this 
		inspired the individual communities to continue fighting for the 
		protection of their communities and traditions.&nbsp; Documenting the success 
		of Indian communities, the <i>Real American</i> continued to promote the 
		idea of one Native American community and inspired more to join.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did Native Americans have to fight to keep their 
		people alive, they also had to fight to keep the land that had belonged 
		to them for hundreds of years.&nbsp; Throughout the 1920s, native communities 
		were engaged in a number of land battles throughout the country.&nbsp; The 
		May 29 issue of the <i>Real American</i> featured an article about a 
		timber claim that had been won by the Quinault Indians of Washington 
		State.&nbsp; The June 19 issue included an article about the same claim, 
		reporting that the allotment of these lands would be deferred to a later 
		date.&nbsp; Land battles like the Quinault case were very common during this 
		period.&nbsp; The <i>Real American</i> presented these articles in a way that 
		would create a sense of hope in the reader.&nbsp; At the same time, the paper 
		made it obvious the battles would not be easily won and encouraged 
		Native Americans to stand up and fight for what was rightfully theirs.&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Real American</i> also featured updated news about 
		land battles that were occurring in other parts of the country.&nbsp; The 
		June 5 issue detailed the issues surrounding an ongoing law suit in 
		Texas, in which Indians were suing to control more than one million 
		acres of land in the Panhandle.&nbsp; The paper informed its readers that the 
		Texas Cherokee based their claim upon a one-hundred year old treaty, 
		which had been signed by their ancestors and the Republic of Texas. &nbsp;It 
		was common for treaties between whites and Natives to be manipulated in 
		favor of the whites and this article gave hope that the Indians would be 
		able to renew their claim.&nbsp; Coverage of treaty rights provided one more 
		example of how the <i>Real American</i> contributed to the creation of a 
		broadly defined Native American community.&nbsp; In pointing out similarities 
		among native peoples all over the United States, the newspaper attempted 
		to convince its readers to set aside their tribal differences and come 
		together as one people.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Real American</i> also recognized the important role 
		of education for an emerging nationwide indigenous community.&nbsp; Articles 
		about population growth also provided information about the growing 
		number of pupils attending the Indian schools.&nbsp; The tone of these 
		articles are optimistic in that they realize the importance of 
		education, but they also realize that funds for the schools were far 
		short of what they needed to be.&nbsp; The May 15 issue addressed this 
		concern and in a subtle way encouraged the community to stand up and 
		fight for the funding that was necessary.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newspaper also set out to correct some common 
		misconceptions among the white population about Native Americans.&nbsp; The 
		June 12 issue carried an article entitled “To the White People,” which 
		read:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The conflicting 
		statements, half-truths and prejudiced personal views flooding the 
		country today in the discussion of Indian questions,&nbsp; make it 
		exceedingly difficult for the average person to form accurate 
		conclusions.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The editorials and 
		articles dealing with the Past, Present, and Future of the Indian 
		printed in THE REAL AMERICAN possess an individuality and character not 
		found in other publications.&nbsp; The Real American is edited and published 
		by all Indians who are up to the minute in all questions regarding the 
		Indian.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></b></span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><i>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">This 
		shows the <i>Real American</i> was not only out to create a community of 
		Native American people but it also wanted to educate white people 
		interested in hearing both sides of the conflict between white Americans 
		and Native Americans.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The <i>Real American</i> promoted the formation of a Native 
		American community in many ways.&nbsp; The newspaper presented articles about 
		several different tribes to promote their belief that Native American 
		people were all one people - a people that needed to stick together in 
		order to overcome the challenges that faced them.&nbsp; The newspaper also 
		presented several ideas about what it meant to this particular community 
		to be American and in this case be a “real” American.&nbsp; The <i>Real 
		American</i> did not equate being American with United States 
		citizenship.&nbsp; Rather, the newspaper considered its readers and the 
		communities it served to be ‘real’ Americans.&nbsp; Before the expansion of 
		citizenship rights to all Indian people in 1924, in all its issues the 
		newspaper implicitly refused to recognize the institutions and politics 
		of the United States as authentically “American.”&nbsp; Only when native 
		people were granted full citizenship rights under the Snyder Citizenship 
		Act, did the newspaper redefine the meaning of “American” to include the 
		United States.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The June 12th issue featured an article with the bold and 
		large headline: “EVERY INDIAN NOW CITIZEN UNDER LAW.”<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Despite its prominent placement, the article was extremely short.&nbsp; It 
		was only a few sentences long and briefly mentioned the act that was 
		signed into law by President Coolidge making every native born Indian a 
		citizen.&nbsp; The brevity of the article suggests the editors of the paper 
		did not necessarily equate citizenship rights from the United States 
		with Indians’ “American” authenticity.&nbsp; The <i>Real American</i> had 
		consistently referred to the Native American communities that were its 
		audience as the only true Americans even before the law had passed.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although citizenship was not the most important 
		qualification to be considered “American,” the newspaper immediately 
		recognized how it could be a helpful tool when fighting for equal 
		rights.&nbsp; In the July 11 issue of the <i>Real American</i>, an article 
		entitled “Miss Williams Makes Protest to President” published a letter 
		written to the president of the United States.&nbsp; Borrowing language from 
		the Declaration of Independence, the letter’s author pointed out that 
		“as free born Americans,” Indians should be guaranteed the “right to 
		life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” and have the right to 
		practice their religious beliefs.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		With their citizenship secured, the publication of this letter suggests 
		Native Americans were willing to stand up to the president and ask for 
		the rights promised to every American citizen.&nbsp; Though Native Americans 
		always saw themselves as Americans, being granted citizenship was a 
		useful tool in the struggle for equal rights.&nbsp; The government had 
		accepted the Native Americans as citizens, and by doing so, Native 
		Americans felt justified in exercising their political rights.&nbsp; They had 
		been standing up for their rights and fought for equal treatment for 
		many years, but now they had the law on their side.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issues of the <i>Real American</i> also made several other 
		references to role of the Native American in American institutions.&nbsp; An 
		article for the July 3 issue, entitled “Symbolism,” highlighted the Camp 
		Fire Girls’ use of Native American symbols.&nbsp; This article spoke with 
		pride that the Camp Fire Girls would use Indian symbolism.&nbsp; As the 
		author suggested, “Indians are Americans” and “Camp Fire is essentially 
		an American movement.”&nbsp; The article further argued the club for girls 
		was helpful to the Indian cause: “Symbolism in Camp Fire gives color and 
		interest to our living… thereby enriching life.”<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		As a positive integration of Native American culture into American 
		culture, the article brought a sense of pride to the readers of the <i>
		Real American.</i>&nbsp; Although Native Americans had always seen themselves 
		as the authentic American, the appropriation of native symbols suggests 
		white Americans were beginning to see this too.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Real American </i>newspaper from Hoquiam, Washington 
		promoted the idea of a broad and solidified Native American community in 
		many ways.&nbsp; The newspaper introduced Native Americans in the northwest 
		to the struggles of other tribes living in the United States.&nbsp; The 
		newspaper also brought together diverse native communities by allowing 
		its readers to share in the triumph and travail of other tribal groups.&nbsp; 
		The <i>Real American</i> brought together Native Americans as a 
		community, setting aside tribal differences.&nbsp; The newspaper defined what 
		it meant to be American in many ways and gave its readers a sense of 
		pride in having such an identity.</span></p>
