      history of IBEW Local 46, and the region’s labor movement in general, is
      complicated, with elements of reaction and racism at one extreme and
      inclusiveness and revolutionary ideals at the other. For instance, the
      Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) focused much of its energy on the
      Northwest. These revolutionary s<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">yndicalists
      stood for the organization of all workers into one big union, regardless
      of race, gender or origin. The IWW fought for a better life for all
      working people. Their influence has been wide and lasting. Today the IBEW
      Local 46 website includes passages on the IWW, their
      history and tactics, even though Local 46’s craft unionism stands in
      marked contrast to the industrial unionism advocated by the Wobblies. And

      <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black;mso-bidi-font-weight:

      of racism inside the American Federation of Labor (AFL), an organization
      that is supposed to protect and improve worker’s situations. The AFL’s
      precursor in Seattle, the Knights of Labor, formed in the aftermath of an
      anti-Chinese riot in 1886 which drove most of the city’s Asian
      population out of the city.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[1]</span></a>
      The IBEW is an AFL craft union where members are organized based on their
      skill instead of their belonging to an industry. An industrial union of
      the construction industry, which does not exist in this country, would
      include carpenters, iron workers, electricians, pipe-fitters, material
      handlers, truck drivers and even non-management office workers. Under the
      craft union system, the different trades in an industry are divided by job
      description rather than workplace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      this environment, nepotism dominates as the vehicle for trade recruitment,
      and typically reinforces racial and gender exclusion. <o:p>

      ’s construction industry as an “FBI” union, indicating a
      relationship of “father, brother or in-law” is useful in attaining
      membership. These nepotistic ties are not limited to members inside the
      union, but across the industry. For instance, Rick Zenner, once the
      president of Local 46’s Wiremen’s Unit, is now a superintendent at
      McKinstry’s electrical division, and more than one of his children
      currently serve apprenticeships. Owners of electrical contracting
      companies are often able to introduce their family members into the union
      as electricians, creating personal links between workers and owners that
      obscure the issue of class and weaken the union’s ability to advance the
      quality of life of its members. This closed system of recruitment, coupled
      with the desirability of these high wage jobs, has led to the formation of
      minority groups over the years whose goal has been to integrate the
      construction industry. This is the legacy of the EWMC.<u><o:p>

      organization. Membership is open to anyone belonging to Local 46 and is
      actively encouraged, but despite their small numbers, black people have
      always played a disproportionately strong political role the labor
      movement, from fighting slavery through the Civil War and Reconstruction,
      to the rise of the CIO and in groups like the EWMC in the modern labor

      particularly vicious oppression that black men experience in everyday
      life, and not a minority of the population, white women have been
      historically discriminated against in the electrical industry in patterns
      that parallel other oppressed groups. Women electricians are stereotyped
      in ludicrous ways. Male electricians of a variety of political persuasions
      routinely state that women only join the trade to find a husband. In fact,
      women have sought entry into the trades for the same reasons as all
      workers- high wages and good benefits. Janet Lewis the first white woman
      to join Local 46 as an electrical apprentice remembers her early
      experiences fighting for equal training:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“In 1974 we were doing a lot of high-rises and you could get
      pigeon-holed doing nothing but lighting for a year and on top of that you
      were the last hired and first fired…It was hard because at a certain
      point it wasn’t the contractor who was out to get you or your union, but
      your actual brothers, the people you worked with hated you.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[2]</span></a>

      worker has black skin, it is their skin that is different, where as a
      woman electrician can appear to be physically inferior to a male
      electrician based on her size, build and strength. In fact tools do most
      of the actual work an electrician produces, especially power tools which
      are required to be provided by the contractor by contract.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[3]</span></a>
      Electrical construction does put physical demands on a worker, but it
      should be the worker’s decision whether or not they choose to be in a
      difficult trade. The mission statement of the IBEW declares its purpose to
      pursue an ever increasing quality of life for the membership. Regardless
      of gender, the idea is not to overwork oneself. <o:p>

      isolation of not feeling completely represented by political groups
      dominated by black men or white women. Beverly Sims, one of the first
      black people in Local 46 and first women to complete Local 46’s
      electrical apprenticeship notes that while white women did organize to
      defend themselves when they first got into the trade, “They were really
      clandestine. It wasn’t about saying ‘We have a right to be here!’
      They never waged any campaigns. It was more of a support group.” And,
      “Black Men were sexist too. I’m not going to lie. All men are sexist.
      They have to be to live in this society.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[4]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      most other racial minorities. By 1969, of the 2,700 members of the local
      only two were non-white. The glaringly white presence of the
      non-integrated electricians working on construction sites in the central
      district, like Medgar Evers Pool, provoked a demonstration by the Central
      Contractors Association (CCA)- an organization of black and Hispanic
      contractors.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

      economic opportunity and working conditions experienced by these
      “contractors” was worse than that of a union construction worker and
      should not be confused with the position of white construction company
      owners. Rather, the goal of CCA demonstrations was to gain entry into the
      unions and attain positions as workers on union job sites. The CCA
      employed militant tactics, such as occupations, to shut down job sites and
      was successful in spite of continuing hostility from the unions.
      Demonstrations were held by the CCA at construction sites across the city,
      especially at government buildings being erected with tax dollars like the

      of The U.S. Department of Justice vs. Ironworkers Local 86, introduced
      legal language dictating to the building trade’s unions that they would
      integrate. The United Construction Workers Association (UCWA) was one
      group of black worker-activists authorized by the courts to oversee the
      execution of the order in industry. For workers in the Local 46 EWMC,
      Tyree Scott, the leader of the UCWA, himself an electrician who would join
      Local 46, is a legend. All the early black members of Local 46 came into
      the union either directly from these struggles or as a result of the
      affirmative action legislation that they led to. While not<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      Individual workers who got in through affirmative action in the seventies

      to retire from Local 46 with full benefits (which requires 30,000 hours of

      demonstrations, nine women started apprenticeships. While minority male
      workers were often able to be organized in as journeymen, women mostly
      lacked prior construction experience and had to come in as apprentices.
      Still, women have been able to progress up the industry ladder better than
      non-white males. Cooperation and division between these two oppressed

      legacy of Tyree Scott and the UCWA lived on in Local 46 after the early
      seventies in the political work of black electricians. While not part of
      an official Local caucus like the EWMC, black electrical workers were
      organized and did meet and communicate on what situations they were
      encountering. The UCWA and later Labor Equality Law Office (LELO)
      facilitated the organization these workers. Because of their reputation
      for activism and the confrontational way they got into the union, these
      first black workers were often blacklisted by electrical contractors and
      found themselves working in maintenance for government agencies that hire
      out of Local 46 or traveling to other locals in search of work. Tyree
      Scott for instance, found a place where he could work as an electrician

      cabinet consisted of Ron Rouzan as vice president, Tony Elliot (a female
      journeyman) as treasurer and Sandra Moore-Jones as secretary. Daryl Prevo
      (current EWMC President) organized to get a charter from the national EWMC
      and started a dues assessment of $20 a week so they could put away money
      for a legal fund. The first meeting attracted forty members. While most
      new members were black, white women and other minorities also joined. Even
      white males would occasionally join. White EWMC member Doug Johnson
      describes his interest in the organization as such, “If [the local] was
      all white boys we’d just eat each other up…Instead of a fifteen minute
      break you’d start taking a seven minute break, which would turn into a
      five minute one, then no break at all. Then you start bringing in your own
      tools to keep that job. That’s what the white boys would do. The
      minorities keep everything in check. The women also. They’re the ones
      who push for equal rights, better conditions, they’re the ones who
      struggle for the union worker.”<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
      Local 46 EWMC got a lot of support initially from the city-wide minority
      worker’s movement. The Breakfast Club, a thirty-five year old club of
      black pipe-fitters and plumbers, who meet for breakfast at Skyway Bowl to
      discuss their union issues, also came to the first few meetings to talk
      about what issues to address and how. Tyree Scott, helped with advice and
      tactics too. He was instrumental in getting the caucus going on its first
      successful campaign.<o:p>

      campaign happened in April of 1998 at the Safeco Stadium construction
      site. It was a big job and an outside agency had been hired to monitor
      progress of the project and engage in community outreach, including
      enforcement of minority employment goals. White had been monitoring the
      apprenticeship and realized that the Safeco project had been skirting the
      laws by merely advertising the project’s availability to minorities
      without actually recruiting minorities. The caucus sent a delegation to a
      public meeting and called the situation out, the meeting was rapidly
      adjourned. Amidst these problems, a situation developed where racist iron
      workers, who had traveled to <st1:City w:st="on">

      pieces of steel from the ceiling when one of the women or racial
      minorities working there walked underneath. They were trying to send a
      message to minorities. That message was also seen in the restrooms in the
      form of racist vandalism. The hang-man’s noose began to appear on the
      jobsite as a threat to those who’s demographics put them outside the
      white-male, Christian majority.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[14]</span></a><o:p>

      Employment Law Office (LELO), the Seattle EWMC and other labor
      organizations, with Scott, Simmons and current LELO leader Mike Woo, a
      pipe-fitter. A Project Labor Agreement governing the job specifically
      forbade work stoppages of any kind. According to Fred Simmons, Local
      46’s leadership gave the walk out no support because work stoppages
      weren’t sanctioned. Organizers of the walk out had to meet together off
      site to plan the event. Word got around and what was supposed to be a
      small meeting attracted nearly a hundred workers. When it was time to
      walk, LELO contacted the media and everyone one stopped production,
      including the Local 86 Seattle Iron Workers. Only the <st1:State w:st="on">

      concerned stadium workers met at a diner a few blocks away from their job
      site to talk about the dangers they were facing and how to best resolve
      it…One young black worker said, ‘this is clearly a black/white
      issue…’ An older black worker disagreed and made an argument for the
      white stadium workers who were offended by the action of this group.
      ‘The vast majority of white workers, also, are opposed to what’s been
      going on,’ he argued. Respecting the view of the older worker and his
      allies, the younger worker asked, ‘What then is the issue?’ Another
      worker explained that while the attacks were most often directed at women
      and people of color, the real danger was that they constituted an unsafe
      work environment. He said that all workers felt threatened by the climate
      on their job. ‘Safety,’ he said, ‘that is the real issue.’”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[16]</span></a><o:p>

      equal opportunity and employment for minorities at all levels of the IBEW

      Mason, one of the women who joined the electrical apprenticeship in 1979,
      used affirmative action opportunities to rapidly climb the industry ladder
      and become the apprenticeship training director. Under her leadership, by
      1991 the apprenticeship had surpassed the state quota of 22 percent
      minorities to reach a height of 27 percent. Her efforts to get the
      apprenticeship to that point included changing the policy of accepting
      applications for only two weeks every two years, to accepting applications
      all the time and actively recruiting in minority communities.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn17" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[17]</span></a>

      activity. By working with the apprenticeship committee at the time of the
      Safeco campaigns, the EWMC was able to get the funding to set up
      application tables at community events and print advertisements in
      community newspapers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn18" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[18]</span></a>
      This type of recruitment also reaches potential white applicants who live
      in integrated communities and would normally be isolated from this kind of
      opportunity because they don’t know anyone in the union. Much remains to
      be done by the EWMC in terms of recruiting. Other trades such as the
      pipe-fitters have successfully fought their apprenticeship application
      procedures and remove various subjective factors from the process such as
      academic tests and panel interviews. When Simmons applied to the
      apprenticeship program, his interview was conducted by</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
      two white guys “drunk as hell” and luckily in a good mood. They told
      him that the difference between this and any other job is that as a union
      construction worker you can “tell someone to kiss your ass” and get a
      new job the next day. While not an example of racism, this story
      illustrates the pointless nature of the procedure.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[19]</span></a><span style="color:black;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p>

      were pitted against each other in competition for positions. Mandates to
      fill foreman and apprenticeship positions with a minority worker were
      disproportionately going to white women. In the most offensive cases,
      wives, sisters and daughters of powerful local members were brought in
      while blacks were iced out. But more subtly, women were simply promoted
      above black and other minority workers because the white male higher-ups
      felt more comfortable working with a perceived inferior of their own race,
      than a competitive minority male who would want to promote and retain more
      minority males at the company.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn20" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[20]</span></a>

      the years, the caucus has maintained itself as a factor in the political
      direction of Local 46. Many different political currents operate together
      within the caucus. That is the nature of an organization united by
      anti-racism, anti-sexism and open to everything else. Keeping lines of
      communication open and treating differences as a fact that will always
      need attention helps keep the caucus together and in the end fosters a
      more sophisticated political program. A strength of the EWMC is that it
