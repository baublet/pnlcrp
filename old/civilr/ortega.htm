	  <p class="arial10">Estela Ortega is the  Executive Director of El Centro de la Raza. She was born in Houston, Texas in 1950. During elementary school, Ortega became aware of the power of race as she noticed teachers treating non-white students differently. As a teenager, she came to appreciate Mexican and Chicano/a culture and attended numerous study groups and meetings that enabled her to develop an ethnic consciousness rooted in the Chicano Movement. Ortega involved herself in the United Farm Workers unionization campaign in Stafford, Texas by setting up a booth at a local dance and selling union buttons and distributing information to the public. </p>
		  	<p class="arial10">In 1972, Ortega met Seattle Chicanos Roberto Maestas (whom she later married) and Juan Bocanegra at a Chicano conference in El Paso, Texas. Shorty after this meeting, Ortega received a newspaper clipping of the Chicano takeover of the abandoned elementary school at Beacon Hill with an invitation from Maestas to join. She arrived in Seattle in late October of 1972 and immediately enlisted with the Chicano Ad-Hoc Committee in their occupation of the school, the future site of El Centro de la Raza. Ortega performed numerous volunteer duties including security, facility maintenance, and secretarial work and remained an active volunteer for the next seven years. As El Centro de la Raza expanded its services and employment opportunities, Ortega was able to translate her activism into a career through the center. </p>
		  	<p class="arial10">Ortega became director of El Centro in 2009 and received the Latino Heritage Award from the city of Seattle that same year. She continues to be active in various civil rights causes. She has developed solidarity networks in Latin America, especially Nicaragua, and is a vocal advocate of cross-racial alliances in the pursuit of social justice. Ortega is an adamant proponent of Latinas&rsquo; rights and credits El Centro de la Raza as a space that promotes the empowerment and involvement of women in both day-to-day decisions and strategic planning for the center. </p>
