	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1942, Florise Spearman and Dorothy West Williams became the 
	first African Americans ever to be hired at the&nbsp; Seattle-based Boeing 
	Airplane Company.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This important milestone capped a long struggle for African Americans 
	seeking the right to work at Boeing. Beginning in 1939 and continuing 
	through World War II, African American activism combined with pressure from 
	the federal government to finally force the company to relax its racially 
	exclusive hiring policy and integrate its workforce.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper positions the campaign within the context of three 
	overlapping developments. The first is the formation of a politically active 
	African American community in Seattle over the course of the first four 
	decades of the twentieth-century.&nbsp; Starting in 1939, a black activist and 
	former local Communist Party leader, Hutchen R. Hutchins, led the charge 
	against the Boeing Company and the International Association of Machinists. 
	Hutchins founded the Committee for the Defense of Negro Labor’s Right to 
	Work at the Boeing Airplane Company (CDNL) in 1940.&nbsp; The Seattle-based 
	African American newspaper, the <u>Northwest Enterprise</u>, was the driving 
	force behind this campaign, and Hutchins used his position as a reporter for 
	the <u>Enterprise </u>to facilitate his activism.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The second context is the struggle between the Boeing Company and its 
	principle union, the International Association of Machinists (IAM) Local 
	751.&nbsp; Boeing blamed Local 751 for the discriminatory hiring practices 
	against African Americans while the local union in turn blamed both the 
	company and its own national leadership.&nbsp; Briefly in 1940, the local union 
	decided to allow African American members, but this was soon revoked when 
	local union leadership was accused of Communist activities and removed by 
	the parent IAM.&nbsp; In truth, both the IAM and the Boeing Company&nbsp; had 
	histories of racial discrimination in the workplace.&nbsp; Boeing had never hired 
	African Americans in its twenty-five years of existence, and the IAM had a 
	clause in its oath that banned blacks from membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third context is the role of the federal government.&nbsp; In 
	June of 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt, under intense pressure from 
	national African American leaders, issued Executive Order 8802.&nbsp; The order 
	required that all companies with government contracts cease discriminatory 
	hiring practices and established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) 
	to investigate the employment practices of companies like Boeing.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, 
	despite the order, the Boeing Company did not immediately comply. As 
	historian Quintard Taylor points out, “in the ten weeks after the executive 
	order became law, the company hired 1,000 new employees per week, but not 
	one was black.”<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> 
	And it would take even longer for the IAM&nbsp; to finally change its policy and 
	grant African Americans membership.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States entered the war&nbsp; in December of 1941 after the 
	Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; Men and women all over the nation joined the 
	war effort by purchasing bonds, enlisting in the military, rationing food 
	and supplies, and signing up to work in war craft industries.&nbsp; Many of these 
	newer industries were located on the west coast, which prompted&nbsp; a&nbsp; 
	large-scale migration of workers and their families to the region.&nbsp; As 
	Taylor states, “forty-five thousand African Americans migrated to the 
	Pacific Northwest to work in World War II defense industries.” Largely as a 
	result, between 1940 and 1950 Seattle’s black population grew 413 percent, 
	from 3,789 to 15,666.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite their small 
	numbers prior to World War II, African Americans in Seattle built an active 
	community through networks of families, churches, civic organizations, and 
	fraternal clubs.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The first two African American churches, First African Methodist Episcopal, 
	founded in 1886, and Mount Zion Baptist, founded in 1890, often opened up 
	their facilities to the public for meetings, forums, and rallies.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	There were also black organizations such as the Knights of Pythias, the 
	Masons, and the Odd Fellows.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The community had a wide variety of nightclubs, entertainers, and sports 
	teams that it supported.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	For its size, the African American community in Seattle was also very 
	politically active. African Americans created a number of local branches of 
	national organizations, including the NAACP, the Universal Negro Improvement 
	Association, the National Urban League, and the National Negro Congress.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although Seattle seemed 
	far removed from the Jim Crow South, with its brutal mobs and lynching, and 
	even from the institutional racism of the Northeast, it was not free from 
	the divisions caused by racial discrimination.&nbsp; Much like the rest of the 
	nation, African Americans in Seattle were often the last to be hired and the 
	first to be fired, and they were not admitted to most unions, including the 
	longshoremen’s union and the waitresses’ union.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This in turn often caused blacks to become strikebreakers, which further 
	widened the gap between white and black workers in Seattle.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	African Americans were generally limited to menial jobs. Black men could 
	work as servants, waiters, and janitors while black women most often worked 
	as domestic or personal servants.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Discrimination in 
	Seattle was not limited to employment.&nbsp; African Americans were called racist 
	names and segregated in schools.&nbsp; Segregated housing was another major 
	concern as restrictive covenants banning blacks from certain neighborhoods 
	became widespread during the interwar period. [link to “Segregated Seattle” 
	section].&nbsp;&nbsp; These covenants forced the majority of blacks to live in what is 
	now known as the Central District, a region between Downtown Seattle and 
	Lake Washington.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">African Americans 
	generally stayed within the confines of their own community and, although 
	politically active, did not often militantly challenge the discrimination 
	that was evident in Seattle.&nbsp; There were of course exceptions.&nbsp; In the early 
	1930s, African Americans in the Communist Party, including Revels Cayton and 
	the future chairman of the Committee for the Defense of Negro Labor’s Right 
	to Work at the Boeing Airplane Company, Hutchen R. Hutchins, aggressively 
	protested racism and discrimination in Seattle and linked it to events 
	occurring in the rest of the nation. And in the mid thirties a broad 
	coalition of black and white organizations, including the Communist Party, 
	the NAACP, and the Urban League successfully fended off two 
	anti-intermarriage bills introduced in the state legislature. More 
	typically, however, small political groups would challenge discriminatory 
	practices on a limited scale.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> 
	For the most part, these efforts failed to yield dramatic results because 
	the African American community was too small to make a major impact.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As the main newspaper 
	serving the African American community in Seattle in the 1930s and 1940s, 
	the <u>Northwest Enterprise</u> was the voice of a number of civil rights 
	struggles.&nbsp; The newspaper’s editors were important political leaders in the 
	African American community, including William Wilson who was president of 
	the local chapter of the NAACP during the early 1930s, Prentice Frazier and 
	Clarence Anderson who were leaders of the Seattle Urban League, and Edward 
	Robinson who was a prominent business owner.&nbsp; <u>The Northwest Enterprise</u> 
	gave each of these men a podium to voice their concerns over such topics as 
	discrimination in the workplace and equal housing opportunities and helped 
	bring the community together to achieve common goals.&nbsp; In the early 1940s, 
	the paper would build on this legacy, becoming a crucial resource for black 
	activists struggling for the right to work at Boeing.

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Boeing campaign is 
	also an example of how African Americans had to overcome conservative labor 
	unions in their struggle for equal employment opportunities. Throughout the 
	nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, unions often played a significant 
	part in upholding the color line in American industries..&nbsp; The American 
	Federation of Labor (AFL), founded in 1886 with Samuel Gompers as its 
	president, was formed to help workers gain rights through solidarity and 
	mutual aid.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	However, the AFL was not an organization intended&nbsp; for African Americans.&nbsp; 
	Some AFL unions practiced discrimination in their ranks, even if they 
	allowed African Americans to join, while others, like the IAM, explicitly&nbsp; 
	barred African Americans from membership altogether.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The International Association of Machinists was formed in 1888 
	and by 1889 had thirty-nine locals.&nbsp; In 1895, it joined the AFL, and over 
	the next thirty-five years grew to be one of the largest unions in the 
	Federation.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The IAM was originally an organization for highly skilled craftsmen who 
	performed general operations on locomotives and other engines.&nbsp; By the turn 
	of the century this changed as groups of specialists such as the Allied 
	Metal Mechanics entered the union.&nbsp; Over time, the jurisdiction of the IAM 
	continued to broaden as semiskilled automobile and aircraft workers were 
	admitted.&nbsp; By the 1930s,&nbsp; the IAM was no longer a union specifically for&nbsp; 
	skilled machinists, but rather was beginning to resemble a quasi-industrial 
	union.<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discriminatory practices in the IAM started to change when the 
	Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) challenged the AFL’s leadership.&nbsp; 
	Led by United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) president John L. Lewis,&nbsp; a 
	delegation to the 1935 national convention challenged AFL leadership by 
	proposing a shift toward industrial unionism,&nbsp; a strategy&nbsp; that sought to 
	organize both skilled and unskilled labor within entire industries.&nbsp; Lewis 
	and his supporters were rejected by the AFL, which caused them to form the 
	rival CIO.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The CIO knew that it had to have an inclusive policy&nbsp; uniting black and 
	white workers together if it was&nbsp; to gain power and survive in the labor 
	arena.&nbsp; In 1939, the CIO had about 1,838,000 members and included The United 
	Automobile Workers (UAW), the United Steel Workers (USW), the UMWA, the 
	United Electrical Workers (UE), and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of 
	America (ACWA).<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	In the late 1930s, these unions began to work with black communities, 
	promising them more jobs and opportunities. Because of this, civil rights 
	groups formed alliances with the CIO.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Walter White, the executive 
	secretary of the NAACP, stated, “the CIO has proved … it stands for Negro 
	advancement.&nbsp; It has fought for our people within the unions and outside the 
	unions.”<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Boeing Airplane Company became a battleground for the fight 
	for African Americans’ right to work.&nbsp; Founded in 1917 by William Boeing, 
	the Boeing Company started with just twenty-eight employees, including 
	pilots, carpenters, boat builders, and seamstresses.&nbsp; After securing a Navy 
	contract during World War I, Boeing was able to expand both in employment 
	and in production.&nbsp; However, with the end of the war came a contraction in 
	the demand for airplanes.&nbsp; The Boeing Company took to making furniture and 
	boats in order to survive.&nbsp; Throughout the 1920s, Boeing was able to sell 
	some small orders for aircraft, started to make mail-carrying planes, and 
	even began to make passenger planes.&nbsp; By the 1930s, Boeing sent passenger 
	airplanes from coast to coast, trained pilots, and continued to ship mail 
	throughout the country.<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in the mid 1930s that Boeing started to build large 
	military aircraft.&nbsp; The B-17 was developed in 1935 as the first Boeing 
	military plane to have a flight deck instead of an open cockpit, and it was 
	outfitted with bombs and machine guns.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The Army Air Corps ordered eighty B-17s in 1940 and twenty more were sent to 
	the British Royal Air Force that same year.&nbsp; The B-29 was introduced in 1939 
	and became the largest bomber to be manufactured during the war.&nbsp; It had a 
	number of new special features, including mounted guns that could be fired 
	via remote control.<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	By the end of the war, 3,970 B-29s had been built, most of them at Boeing 
	facilities.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The massive contracts for both the B-17 and the B-29 enabled&nbsp; Boeing to come 
	out of World War II as one of the nation’s leaders in airplane manufacturing 
	and also one of the largest employers in Seattle. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 
	IAM established a local branch at Boeing in 1935 in order to unionize 
	Boeing’s expanding number of workers.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	This&nbsp; branch, Local 751, was an industrial union, but it was assigned to the 
	IAM by the Executive Council of the AFL.&nbsp; This occurred because although the 
	AFL was generally against industrial unions, the international unions within 
	the AFL were allowed to decide amongst themselves who was to have 
	jurisdiction over what industry, and hence, what local.&nbsp; With only 
	thirty-five founding members, IAM Local 751 was able to sign its first 
	collective bargaining agreement with Boeing in 1936.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The CIO was still very new and did not focus on the aircraft industry until 
	1939; by that time, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recognized IAM 
	Local 751 as the bargaining agent at Boeing and the workers there were well 
	established with that union.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In barring African 
	American membership, the IAM was reinforcing the Boeing Company’s own 
	longstanding policy of racial exclusion.&nbsp; From the company’s founding in 
	1917 through the first years of World War II, not a single African American 
	was hired at Boeing, despite its massive growth over the period.&nbsp; Members of 
	the African American community challenged the Boeing Company because it had 
	become one of the largest&nbsp; employers in the region, and blacks wanted&nbsp; to be 
	included.&nbsp; As Quintard Taylor writes, this meant that “if economic exclusion 
	was at the heart of the black community’s dilemma, and progress in this area 
	appeared virtually impossible, then politics and civil rights would provide 
	a way out.”<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Drawing on existing community resources and a tradition of political 
	activism, African Americans in Seattle would eventually gain the right to 
	work at the Boeing Company, but it would take&nbsp; the intervention of the 
	federal government for this to happen.&nbsp;</span></p>

	activist ideals and its willingness to openly attack racism and 
	discrimination, and was able to quickly work his way up through the ranks to 
	become one of the few African American leaders in the party.&nbsp; Cayton used

	Susie Revels Cayton, Revels’ mother, also became a member of the Communist

	For local African Americans like the Caytons and Hutchen Hutchins, as well 
	as for African Americans in other regions of the country, the Communist 
	party&nbsp; in the 1930s was an important ally in the struggle for civil rights 
	and social justice.&nbsp; However, association with the CP also left black and 
	white activists open to the red baiting tactics of civil rights opponents 
	who sought to paint the movement as subversive in order to discredit it.&nbsp;

	wartime industry boom, a number of African Americans came to Seattle to work 
	at Boeing. As was the case in defense industries throughout the nation, many 
	of these workers were women.&nbsp; They had been trained in their local areas by 
	the National Youth Administration, which was created during the 1930s as a 
	way to train young people in trades and then assist them in finding jobs.<a name="_ednref63" title href="#_edn63"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[63]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Once they came to Seattle, many found work&nbsp; at Boeing, although they were 
	still subjected to racial discrimination.&nbsp; Some of the African American 
	women who worked at Boeing during World War II recall their experiences as 
	positive, as they were able to travel away from home, seek adventure, and 
	make more money than they ever had before.&nbsp; However, others remember the 
	discrimination faced in the workplace as they were banned from the union and 
	treated like second-class citizens. Whatever their experience, these women 
	owed their jobs to the activism of the local African American community and 
	the intervention of the federal government.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Belle Alexander described how in Georgia she was trained in 
	sheet metal for three months, welding for another three months, and then was 
	put on a bus bound for Seattle.&nbsp; She remembers working with mostly women in 
	the three years she was at Boeing.&nbsp; As a sheet metal worker, Alexander felt 
	that “They don’t talk about nothing but the Riveter,” and wishes other 
	skills were highlighted&nbsp; in the history books as well.&nbsp; A variety of skills 
	were needed to properly build and assemble airplanes at that time.&nbsp; 
	Alexander compared it to making a cake.&nbsp; As with a cake, workers had to 
	start from scratch, from the making of each panel to the assembly.&nbsp; Working 
	for sixty-two cents an hour, Alexander paid union dues but was not allowed 
	to join Local 751.&nbsp; After working at Boeing for three years, she left to 
	start a family, and did not go back because, in her words, “By the time I 
	was all ready to go back, Japan had surrendered.”<a name="_ednref64" title href="#_edn64"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[64]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	There was little job security for African Americans who worked at Boeing 
	during this time, although to&nbsp; some degree&nbsp; this was true across racial 
	lines as whites were also laid off in significant numbers&nbsp; after the war.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other women had similar experiences.&nbsp; Katherine Thompkins came 
	to Seattle from Tulsa, OK when she was sixteen years old.&nbsp; She had trained 
	in welding, but, “When we got out here, the welding we couldn’t do, because 
	of our race.”<a name="_ednref65" title href="#_edn65"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[65]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Her instructor had told her of the possibility of racial discrimination in 
	the workplace, but until she arrived it was unclear what she would have to 
	face.&nbsp; The Boeing Company&nbsp; retrained her in sheet metal work.&nbsp; Thompkins 
	first worked at Plant 1, known as the Little Red Barn, as a mechanic.&nbsp; She 
	too recalls working for sixty-two cents per hour, and received a substantial 
	amount of overtime. Through this she was able to earn a great deal of 
	money.&nbsp; At the end of the war, she was laid off for nine months because her 
	plant was shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the plant reopened, Thompkins was rehired.&nbsp; 
	Although Local 751 did not allow her to join when she first started working 
	at Boeing, she recalls that by 1948 everyone was admitted to the union.&nbsp; 
	Thompkins worked for the Boeing Company for almost forty years.&nbsp; Reflecting 
	on that time, she says, “I felt that it was a difficult job, but the best 
	job for a woman,” because she was able to make more money, have more 
	opportunities, and receive better benefits.<a name="_ednref66" title href="#_edn66"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[66]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Although she was thankful for the job at Boeing, Thompkins remembers facing 
	discrimination in Seattle.&nbsp; For instance, she was not allowed in some shops 
	or restaurants because of her race.&nbsp; There were no signs on these 
	establishments, but she could tell by the atmosphere that she was not 
	welcome.&nbsp; Some restaurants&nbsp; refused to serve her outright.&nbsp; Summarizing her 
	experiences from that time, Thompkins&nbsp; reminds people that “we still have 
	discrimination now;” it has not gone anywhere.<a name="_ednref67" title href="#_edn67"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[67]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katie Burks and Vivian Laye both came from Birmingham, Alabama 
	to work at the Boeing Company.&nbsp; Burks first worked in the tool room and then 
	later as a mechanic.&nbsp; She recalls that coworkers would offer her candy and 
	food stamps if she would do their work, which she gladly did.&nbsp; She also felt 
	a sense of confidence in herself and her job.&nbsp; As she stated, “if the 
	supervisor said anything to me that I didn’t like, I’d tell him off.”<a name="_ednref68" title href="#_edn68"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[68]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	.&nbsp; Vivian Laye weighed only 92 pounds when she first started working for the 
	Boeing Company, and the first machine she was assigned to was too heavy for 
	her to operate.&nbsp; Both&nbsp; women worked on the B-17 and the B-29.<a name="_ednref69" title href="#_edn69"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[69]</span></span></a> 
	The confidence that Burks recalls may have stemmed from the fact that the 
	black community she moved into was small, and most of the blacks she 
	interacted with were not native to Seattle.&nbsp; Even her church, People’s 
	Institutional Baptist Church, had a congregation mostly made up of African 
	Americans from out of state.&nbsp; Laye, however, remembered discrimination in 
	Seattle:&nbsp; “we felt it [discrimination] was more here, because it was 
	hidden.”<a name="_ednref70" title href="#_edn70"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[70]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These women all came to Seattle to work at the Boeing Company 
	during World War II, either to move away from home, to seek adventure, or to 
	support the war effort.&nbsp; They shared similar experiences but different 
	perspectives, which varied from&nbsp; resentment toward the Seattle community and 
	the discrimination faced there, to a sense of belonging and freedom from 
	racial discrimination.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">CONCLUSION</span></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1944, Boeing employed a wartime peak of 1,600 black workers.&nbsp; 
	In 1945, the leadership of Local 751 decided to once again pressure the IAM 
	to remove the clause in its constitution barring African Americans from 
	membership.&nbsp; Local 751 brought the largest delegation of any IAM local to 
	the International Convention in New York.&nbsp; It challenged the discriminatory 
	clause, but was outvoted.&nbsp; A year later, the delegation tried again and this 
	time, was successful.&nbsp; In 1946, Local 751’s delegation convinced the IAM to 
	remove the discriminatory clause from its ritual oath.<a name="_ednref71" title href="#_edn71"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[71]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; African Americans finally won the right to work at the Boeing 
	Company and to participate in Local 751 after a long ordeal involving both a 
	grassroots community campaign and government intervention.&nbsp; Without the 
	efforts of local black activists, the Boeing Company would have continued to 
	deny employment to qualified African Americans.&nbsp; Ultimately, it was FEPC 
	that forced the integration of the Boeing Company, but it was the Seattle 
	African American community, led by the <u>Northwest Enterprise</u> and the 
	CDNL, which had to bring the issue to the attention of the federal 
	government in order to correct the problem.&nbsp; However, even after Boeing 
	began hiring African Americans, blacks still faced racial discrimination in 
	the workplace.&nbsp; There were segregated lunchrooms and bathrooms, and white 
	workers had nicer facilities than black workers.&nbsp; African American workers 
	were often denied promotions and were laid off for protesting&nbsp; 
	discrimination.<a name="_ednref72" title href="#_edn72"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[72]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	And of course being hired did not ensure fair treatment, or even admittance 
	until 1946, in the union. Today, Boeing has come a long way to become a 
	highly integrated workforce with a strong anti-discrimination policy.&nbsp; 
	However, discrimination still exists; it is important to remember how and 
	why people fought discrimination in the past in order to not just keep the 
	status-quo, but to continue forward in the fight for equality in the 
	workplace, on the street, and in the home.</span></p>
