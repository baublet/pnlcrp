    <p class="MsoNormal style6" style="line-height: 120%">	 The influence of communism 
	within the American labor movement significantly altered the course of labor 
	history. Out of this fascinating convergence came a unique figure: the 
	communist labor leader. Studying these men and women, much can be learned about the 
	radicalization, internal politics, and ultimately the suppression of the 
	labor struggle in North America.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal style3 style5" style="line-height: 120%"><span class="arial10 "> With regard to the issue of communism and organized labor on the West Coast of the United States and into British Columbia, 
	  Canada, two figures dominated the stage: Harry Bridges and Harold Pritchett.  </span><span class="arial10"><span style="line-height: 120%">Pritchett was the president of the International Woodworkers of America 
	  (IWA) from 1937 until 1940 while Bridges fearlessly led dockworkers as 
	  president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). Both 
	  men played an integral role in shaping the labor movement during the Great 
	  Depression. Pritchett and Bridges also shared an important characteristic: they 
	  were aliens, non-citizens of the United States. Both were heavily influenced 
	  by the Communist Party and formed their unions into militant protectors of 
	  labor. Both faced persecution from anti-union red-baiters who fought labor’s 
	  every move. Both faced intense scrutiny by the U.S. Government. Both were 
	  tried before the anti-communist tribunals of the time. And both faced 
	  deportation. </span></span></p>
	<p class="arial10" style="line-height: 120%">But while Bridges survived government attempts to deport him, 
	    Pritchett was eventually denied re-entry into the United States because of 
	    his political convictions. Harold Pritchett thus became one of the first 
	    casualties of the “second red scare” and, along with Bridges, personifies 
	    the figure of the communist labor leader on the West Coast. While Bridges' 
	    life has been well chronicled, less is known about Harry Pritchett. This 
	    essay will follow Pritchett from his humble beginnings as a 
	    rank-and-file shingle weaver to his ouster from power as president of the 
	    IWA. Pritchett's life provides unique insight into the lives of woodworkers 
	    and the political struggles that marked IWA history during the 1930s and 
	    1940s. </p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold Pritchett was born on May 9<sup>th</sup>, 1904 in the 
	city of Birmingham, England, widely known for its contribution to the 
	Industrial Revolution. Perhaps these roots destined him for a life 
	in labor and industry.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[1]</span></a> In 1912, at the age of eight, the Pritchett family emigrated from England to 
	Canada aboard the SS “Tunisia” and landed in Quebec.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[2]</span></a> 
	From there, the family traveled to Port Moody in British Columbia, just east 
	of Vancouver, where they settled.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[3]</span></a> 
	After Pritchett graduated from grade school, as a boy aged fifteen years, he 
	began his career in the woodworking industry.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pritchett received his first job at the Thurston-Flavelle 
	sawmill in Port Moody, BC in 1919.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[4]</span></a> 
	For eleven hours a day he tended conveyors in a planer mill (which 
	essentially processes raw timber into a usable product). His wages? Ten 
	cents an hour.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[5]</span></a> It was here that he got his first exposure to the industry and it did not 
	take him long to begin campaigning for worker rights. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%"><span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> The 
	  rapidity with which Pritchett joined the labor movement was no doubt caused 
	  by the deplorable condition of the camps where he worked.</span><span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> The forest industry consisted of two different types of 
	occupations:&nbsp; mill workers and loggers. Though quite different, both 
	involved miserable and dangerous conditions. Aside from the strenuous 
	physical labor – in 1919, not much mechanized machinery had found its way 
	into the industry – the workers in logging camps had to deal with nearly 
	unbearable conditions at the bunkhouses where they stayed. One logger, an 
	old-timer from Sweden named Charlie Hemstrom, remembered “going into the pig 
	pen to get some straw to sleep on. The pigs had some nice straw … we washed 
	in a hole outside.”<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[6]</span></a> After a long day’s work, the men piled into the bunkhouses, their wet 
	clothes drying, filling the air with a suffocating dampness. The boarding 
	conditions were exacerbated by long hours and very low pay. In addition, the 
	lumbermen were in constant danger of physical harm while working in the 
	lumber industry. As historians Jerry Lembcke and William Tattem write, 
	“Safety regulations and inspections were either non-existent or ineffectual, 
	and every week loggers fell beside trees” or were injured or killed in the 
	mills.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[7]</span></a> The conditions served as a major source of discontent for the men. The camps 
	in which the loggers toiled were isolated, and it took a special type of man 
	to handle the work. In a situation where there was little opportunity to 
	communicate with anyone outside of the camp for extended periods of time, a 
	strong bond was formed, a fraternity of men who understood each other’s 
	situations. This brotherhood, in both the camps and the mills, contributed 
	to the development of a strong labor movement that fought to improve the 
	lives of woodworkers. And it was this labor movement that Harold Pritchett 
	joined in 1924, signing up for the Vancouver local of the AFL Shingle 
	Weavers Union and setting the course for the rest of his life. <a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[8]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Northwest quickly became known as a radical stronghold in 
	the early twentieth century. With its extensive mining and logging 
	industries, the Northwest and British Columbia were fertile grounds for 
	labor unrest and radical ideologies such as Marxism. Many of the workers 
	were Scandinavian immigrants who brought with them a penchant for 
	radicalism. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, also commonly known as 
	the Wobblies) was especially active in the Northwest and recruited heavily 
	in the lumber industry. Many of the Scandinavian Wobblies from the Northwest 
	and Canada would participate later on as leaders of the National Lumber 
	Workers Union, a Communist-led organization.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[9]</span></a> 
	This active history provided a strong radical legacy for Pritchett to join.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Pritchett joined the labor movement, he rose quickly in its 
	ranks. After his initial work in the saw mills, Pritchett went on to be 
	employed with the shingle weavers, first as a shingle packer, then as a 
	shingle sawyer.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[10]</span></a> It did not take long for him to hold a position of leadership. A mere three 
	years after joining the labor fight, Pritchett, now employed at the Fraser 
	Mills, became an official in the Shingle Weavers’ Union in 1927.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[11</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">The 
	Shingle Weavers were part of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which 
	was the largest organized labor association and usually the only one that 
	employers would recognize. The only other acceptable union option for 
	woodworkers was the government-sponsored Loyal Legion of Loggers and 
	Lumbermen (LLLL). The 4-L was the federal response to labor radicalism 
	during World War I and was not well respected by labor’s militant leaders.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[12]</span></a> The AFL was a craft based federation, which meant it was opposed to the idea 
	of an all-inclusive industrial union that organized &quot;unskilled&quot; workers of a 
	particular industry alongside skilled workers, let alone the notion of &quot;one 
	big union&quot; advocated by the IWW. The AFL's selective membership effectively 
	ostracized most of the woodworkers. The woodworkers were an eclectic group, 
	comprised of lumber and sawmill workers, plywood and veneer workers, pile 
	drivers, coopers, shingle weavers, furniture workers, and boommen and 
	rafters,<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[13]</span></a> 
	and most found themselves unrepresented in the AFL. The elitist, old-style 
	attitude of the AFL would prove to be an issue later on.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> Pritchett was quickly becoming a leading figure in the Northwest’s union 
	community. In 1931, he rose to prominence when he chaired the Fraser Mills 
	Strike Committee. By 1933, at age twenty-nine, Pritchett was president of a 
	Shingle Weavers local. In a meteoric rise to power, Pritchett had asserted 
	himself as a dominant influence in the labor movement, a powerful organizer, 
	and a charismatic leader. However, in what was perhaps the first move in a 
	major battle that would rage for more than ten years, the American 
	Federation of Labor expelled the Pritchett-led Shingle Weavers local and 
	renounced their charter. The reason? “On the grounds that the Union was in 
	the hands of Communists.”<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[14]</span></a></span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">From 
	the onset, communism never sat well with the political and business leaders 
	of the United States. For the ideals of the movement to come to fruition, a 
	complete restructuring of the U.S. government and economy was necessary. 
	That meant revolution, whether sudden or evolutionary. That, in turn, meant 
	the imminent loss of power of the privileged wealthy. And the privileged had 
	vowed to fight. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">The 
	foundation for the fight was laid in 1903, when Congress passed an 
	immigration law allowing for the deportation of those who advocated 
	anarchism (which was often erroneously conflated with communism and 
	socialism).<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[15]</span></a> The extent to which the United States was going to resist communists was 
	demonstrated early in what was later dubbed the “First Red Scare” from 1917 
	to approximately 1921. The First Red Scare was a reaction to the Bolshevik 
	revolution in Russia and the upheaval of World War I. The fear manifested 
	itself in an unprecedented use of federal power to crush what were deemed 
	subversive activities.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">From 
	the beginning, the federal government showed a penchant for attacking labor. 
	The IWW was the first major victim and became the template for future labor 
	suppression. Congress expanded the immigration law in 1918 so that alien 
	members of a group which advocated revolutionary views could be deported, 
	even if they, themselves, didn’t personally support the overthrow of the 
	government.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[16]</span></a> 
	Other legislation included the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 
	1918, which further limited free speech.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[17]</span></a> 
	State and local governments in the Northwest passed criminal syndicalism 
	laws that were used often to persecute radicals and undermine the labor 
	movement.<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[18]</span></a> 
	These laws, all of which restricted civil liberties, set a dangerous 
	precedent and were a dire warning to labor.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">On 
	the fateful day of November 7, 1919, led by future FBI Director J. Edgar 
	Hoover, the Justice Department rounded up 1,100 workers, many with loose or 
	nonexistent ties to the Communist Party, in what became known as the “Palmer 
	Raids.” 249 of these, most without a proper hearing, were deported to 
	Russia.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[19]</span></a> The powers of the United States were obviously highly allergic to the 
	Communist Party and would go to extensive ends to prevent a worker coup. 
	Similar situations existed north of the border in Canada. Though, on the 
	whole, less aggressive in their persecution of radicals, British Columbia 
	was by no means a safe haven for leftists as a “red scare” swept Canada as 
	well. This aggressive and ongoing protection of the status quo in the U.S. 
	would be a major factor in Harold Pritchett and the IWA’s history.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the onset of his work in the sawmills, Harold Pritchett 
	immersed himself in Marxist writings and doctrine. The lumber camps proved 
	fertile ground for the ripening of communist ideals. Through “his 
	discussions with his workmates and regular reading of Marxist literature, 
	[Pritchett] had developed into a politically astute union activist.”<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[20]</span></a> 
	Jerry Lembcke and William Tattam, in their book <i>One Union in Wood</i>, 
	assert that Pritchett, after first joining the socialist Independent Labour 
	Party, was recruited to the Communist Party and became an active member.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[21]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because labor organizers were well aware of the negative 
	connotation affiliation with the Communist Party carried, it is not easy to 
	find conclusive evidence of membership. In fact, throughout all sources, 
	such as public correspondence, hearing proceedings, and newspapers (even 
	publications with known Communist connections), Pritchett denied Communist 
	Party membership. In the <i>Timberworker</i>, the official organ of the IWA 
	with known Communist editors and affiliations, Communist Party membership 
	was repeatedly denied by leaders of the union and any accusations were 
	dismissed as viscous “red-baiting.” In official hearing proceedings on 
	Harold Pritchett by the U.S. Department of Labor, Pritchett was repeatedly 
	asked, “Are you a member of the Communist Party of Canada?” And Pritchett 
	always responded, “No.”<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[22]</span></a>	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Pritchett readily admitted to having strong ties to the 
	Communist Party. At a particular hearing in Vancouver, B.C., Pritchett 
	expounded on his Party connections while under oath. Pritchett stated that 
	he began conferring with the Communists when he joined the labor movement in 
	1924. While he was working in Port Moody (where he had grown up and 
	continued to live as an adult), he attended several meetings of the 
	Communist Party. However, Pritchett specified that the meetings were “open 
	door,” meaning that one did not have to be a member to attend. Participating 
	did not automatically insinuate membership. Pritchett admitted to attending 
	twenty or so meetings.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[23]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a strange coincidence, the Communist Party of Canada owned 
	property directly next door to Harold Pritchett in Port Moody. That property 
	was used not only for meetings, but also for children’s summer camps put on 
	in cooperation with the Communist Party and the Young Communists League, in 
	which Pritchett participated heavily as an organizer. He helped with the 
	sports, swimming, and most other activities. Pritchett, the father of five 
	small boys at the time (ages 3 to 12), also had his children attend the camp 
	with his wife, Hazel. It was a family affair: the children attended 
	instructional classes and put on plays acting out union strikes with 
	employers. The stated purpose of the camp was to provide children who were 
	on relief a vacation (Pritchett was on relief from 1932-34),<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[24]</span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, regardless of the lack of absolute evidence, we might 
	assume that Harold Pritchett was indeed a member of the Communist Party. 
	Everyone who was associated with him knew it, and his policies and actions 
	as a union organizer indicate a commitment to Communist objectives during 
	the Depression:&nbsp; advocating working-class solidarity, a united labor front, 
	civil rights, and social reforms.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Depression years were marked by increased labor action, 
	which resulted in heightened awareness of workers to the class struggle. 
	However the movement was fragmented and unorganized. According to Lembcke 
	and Tattam, “The deteriorating working conditions, high unemployment and low 
	wages that accompanied the onslaught of the 1930s spawned walkouts and 
	sporadic, quick strikes led by short-lived camp or mill committees.&quot;<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[25]</span></a> The chaotic situation was a prime environment for communist rhetoric and 
	Harold Pritchett, along with his longshoreman colleague Harry Bridges, 
	quickly gained the reputation of being an effective and powerful organizer. 
	Union membership jumped to unprecedented levels as workers responded to the 
	call, “Organize! Organize! Organize!” which was often distributed in 
	literature propaganda.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[26]</span></a> 
	Communist organizations, such as the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL) and the 
	National Lumber Worker Union (NLWU) led the way in the early 1930s.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[27]</span></a> They were met with opposition at every turn, though, from the outspoken 
	anti-Communist AFL, which tried to limit Communist influence with blacklists 
	and cooperation with the employers. The Communists, realizing that 
	collaborating with the AFL was not an option, followed the policy of “dual 
	unionism;” instead of trying to change the AFL, they organized along side it 
	as a rival union.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[28]</span></a> 
	Their work was extensive, especially in British Columbia, Canada, where 
	groups of grassroots organizers would sneak from camp to camp and kindle

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> However, despite the increase in union membership, workers saw little to no 
	improvement in their situation. During the labor organizing activity amongst 
	the lumber workers, the fragmented movement began to coalesce, but still 
	lacked a central organizing body. After years of limited gains with 
	employers, the Communists ended the policy of “dual unions” and instead 
	opted for a strategy of “boring from within,” or joining AFL locals and 
	attempting to gain a leftist foothold within the giant federation. The AFL, 
	grasping this opportunity to vastly increase their membership, stepped in 
	and organized the Northwest into 90 FLUs.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[29]</span></a> 
	An FLU, or federal union, was essentially the halfway point between being 
	recognized as a local and being issued a charter for AFL membership. They 
	came under the jurisdiction of Bill Hutcheson, the president of the United 
	Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (UBCJ). Almost overnight, the AFL had 
	added nearly 70,000 dues paying members to its ranks.<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[30]</span></a> 
	Hutcheson sent Abe Muir, an executive board member of the UBCJ, to spearhead 
	the battle for positive change in the lumber industry. Now, with a loose 
	confederation known as the Sawmill and Timber Workers Union, the timber 
	workers went on strike in 1935 with Abe Muir leading the way.<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[31]</span></a></span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">From 
	the beginning, the lumber workers' relationship with the AFL was strained. 
	This was demonstrated in the Great Strike of 1935. It was clear from the 
	onset that Muir and the AFL would be setting the terms with little attention 
	paid to the rank-and-file. Muir negotiated closely with the employers but 
	could not gain the support of the locals. In Muir’s first attempt at a 
	settlement, the timber workers rejected his “compromise” with the employers 
	by a vote of 8 to 1, largely as a result of Communist opposition.<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[32]</span></a> 
	In the end, after months of striking, the workers were urged back to work by 
	the influence of the Secretary of Labor on the terms of Muir and the 
	employers.</span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> Little is documented of Harold Pritchett’s activities during this time. As 
	stated above, he was president of the Shingle Weavers until 1933. He did not 
	hold office continuously,<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[33]</span></a> and it can be assumed he spent his down time out in the field organizing the 
	rank-and-file. He was making his presence known, though, as he would again 
	step into union leadership in 1935. Pritchett’s actions and that of the 
	Communists were having an impact on the AFL. The rank-and-file were 
	dissatisfied with the outcome of the 1935 strike and, spurred on by the 
	Communist organizers, felt that Muir and Hutcheson had not shown the lumber 
	workers respect. The craft-based UBCJ gained the reputation in the 
	industrial Northwest woods of being high-handed, haughty, and a little too 
	big for timber worker britches. The stage was being set for a showdown 
	between the respected Communist organizers and the powerful AFL.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 120%">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UBCJ made several mistakes while dealing with the 
	woodworkers. First of all, Abe Muir failed to win any significant 
	concessions during the great strike of 1935. Also, they blatantly exhibited 
	their elitism by only allowing the woodworkers fraternal status, which 
	didn’t include full voting rights, despite the fact that the UBCJ collected 
	dues.<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[34]</span></a> This was seen as an undeserved insult to the integrity of the woodworkers. 
	When lumber locals’ delegates attended a 1936 UBCJ convention in Florida, 
	having traveled across the entire continent, they were designated as 
	“non-beneficial” and were forced to observe the proceedings without a vote.<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[35]</span></a>&nbsp; 
	The familiar cry of, “No taxation without representation,” echoed throughout 
	the Northwest woods. The arrogant AFL just was not compatible with the rough 
	timber workers. The timber workers felt discounted because they were 
	designated “unskilled” workers and the AFL put little effort and money into 
	organizing the woods. To make matters worse for the UBCJ, Harold Pritchett 
	again stepped into power (after having been relieved in 1933), taking 
	control of the District Council in British Columbia.<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[36]</span></a> The “boring from within” tactic had worked. The central UBCJ leadership had 
	earned a reputation for doing nothing while the Communists within the 
	organization, Harold Pritchett safely at the helm, solidly held the respect 
	of their fellow workers.</span></p>

	more specifically, the UBCJ, a secret convention was called on September 18, 
	1936. The woodworkers of the Northwest gathered in Portland and officially 
	banded together as the Federation of Woodworkers, asserting their power in 
	the face of Abe Muir, Hutcheson, and the UBCJ. Harold Pritchett, 
	spring-boarding to power from his position as president of the UBCJ in BC, 
	not only chaired the convention, but was also elected the Federation’s first 
	president. This was a result of the Communists being seen as the premier 
	opposition to AFL elitism. He did not have a clear mandate for power nor the 
	complete support of all the timber workers,<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[37]</span></a> but the feelings of discontent and desire for change presented the unique 
	opportunity for Pritchett to grab leadership. The woodsmen of the Northwest 
	were now well on their way to building their own identity. As Pritchett 
	wrote, “70,000 industrial woodworkers vulnerable to joint attacks by the 
	employers and top leadership of the AFL,” now had a voice of their own.<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[38]</span></a> 
	This voice, however, was weak and foundationless. The new Federation of 
	Woodworkers was not chartered by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
	Joiners and was officially unaffiliated with any of the major union 
	organizations of the time. The failure of a vote that would have withheld 
	per capita tax from the UBCJ showed that the rank and file still desired 
	contact with the Carpenters.<a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[39]</span></a>

	a better lot. For many workers, more &quot;civil&quot; or traditional means had 
	failed, and now radicalism was a legitimate option. Change was also brewing 
	in Washington, D.C. The AFL had been at the forefront of union organization 
	since the onset of the twentieth century. However, it focused only on 
	craft-based unions, leaving out the broad market of “unskilled,” industrial

	(namely Muir and Hutcheson). However, new offences had been committed in the

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">The

	the Midwest, and even down into the South.<a name="_ednref53" title href="#_edn53"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[53]</span></a>&nbsp; The organization waged many successful strikes against the industry, 
	asserting itself as a powerful collective bargaining agent. According to a 
	report by Pritchett in 1939, membership totaled roughly 100,000 members, 
	though this number has been hotly debated.<a name="_ednref54" title href="#_edn54"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[54]</span></a> 
	In the <i>Timberworker</i>, Pritchett championed the policy of “organize the 
	unorganized,” especially leading up to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual Convention, 
	and he had made this goal a reality. The IWA was also quite powerful in 
	Canada. Pritchett’s home, the British Columbia District, was one of the 
	largest districts in the IWA. The hierarchy in the IWA consisted of the 
	International offices at the top (Pritchett and his administration); the 
	membership was then split into district councils (such as the CRDC), locals, 
	and sub-locals. A local’s strength depended on its surroundings. In cities 
	such as Portland, the local was strong, encompassing a large number of 
	mills, but in smaller towns, locals might only represent a mill or two.<a name="_ednref55" title href="#_edn55"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[55]</span></a>

	Pritchett used the <i>Timberworker</i> as his voice to the IWA 
	rank-and-file, writing a near-weekly article, titled “The President’s 
	Column,” to expound upon not only union issues but national and world 
	concerns as well. During his time as president, he kept the <i>Timberworker</i> closely affiliated with communist ideas. Pritchett wrote continually in 
	support of the New Deal and its social reforms, clearly stating his views on 
	how the IWA rank-and-file should vote. For instance, one editorial was 
	unabashedly titled:&nbsp; “‘No’ On Anti-Labor Measures, ‘Yes’ On New Deal 
	Candidates, Is the Rule For Voting Nov. 8.”<a name="_ednref56" title href="#_edn56"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[56]</span></a> 
	In the lead-up to World War II, Pritchett published many articles blasting 
	fascism, at least up until the Nazi-Soviet Non Aggression Pact in August of 
	1939, after which the regularity of such opinions dropped dramatically in 
	line with the general policy of the Communist Party. During the Spanish 
	Civil War, the <i>Timberworker</i> aligned itself with the “reds” fighting 
	Franco and glorified the revolutionaries participating in the war. In 
	addition, Pritchett often wrote in favor of civil rights and liberties and 
	the need for a united labor front.<a name="_ednref57" title href="#_edn57"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[57]</span></a> He wrote motivational pieces championing the worth and power of the working 
	class which usually were quite spiteful of the elite. As Pritchett wrote on 
	September of 1939, “Slums only exist where workers live and can never be 
	found where employers live … the answer is to build a strong international 
	union.”<a name="_ednref58" title href="#_edn58"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[58]</span></a> Much space was also used to praise the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, 
	commonly known as the Wagner Act, which guaranteed to workers&nbsp; “the right to 
	self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain 
	collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in 
	concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other 
	mutual aid and protection.”<a name="_ednref59" title href="#_edn59"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[59]</span></a> 
	As the war neared, in 1940 especially, the <i>Timberworker</i> filled up 
	with anti-war articles (again, most likely as a result of the Hitler-Stalin 
	pact). At one point, Pritchett blamed the war for the suffering of thousands 
	of fellow workers in Europe.<a name="_ednref60" title href="#_edn60"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[60]</span></a>

	wrote with a complexity that belies the fact that he stopped schooling at 
	age fifteen, and it is obvious he was well read. Pritchett deftly conveyed 
	his belief “that union action should be premised on the understanding that 
	the interests of employers and employees were not the same,” and that only 
	militant labor action could procure the desired results.<a name="_ednref61" title href="#_edn61"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[61]</span></a> This militant platform came out in Pritchett’s writing style, which was 
	forceful and emotional. He truly conveyed his passion for the plight of 
	labor. “The President’s Column” always included a call to action and an 
	affirmation of the movement's value and strength. As Pritchett wrote in his 
	December 3, 1938 column, “…our people have not faltered in their conviction 
	that they have rights which must not be destroyed.” In a way, the column 
	served as a weekly pep talk to the rank-and-file and an occasion to 
	indoctrinate them with Pritchett’s own political beliefs.</span></p>

	For Pritchett, the hearing took place in the summer of 1938. This issue was 
	covered extensively in the <i>Timberworker</i>, which wasted no time in 
	condemning the Dies Committee as the strong arm of Big Business, calling it 
	a direct attack on the IWA. In his presidential address at the 1939 IWA

	Canada, he never had an official deportation hearing. Harry Bridges, 
	however, had quite another story. Bridges was constantly hassled by the 
	government and the legislature even gave Bridges his very own law when

	Secretary of Labor to deport Bridges.<a name="_ednref67" title href="#_edn67"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[67]</span></a> 
	In 1939, the entire labor movement was faced with the possibility of losing 
	one of its most dedicated organizers when Bridges, faced with deportation, 
	went on trial for subversive (communist) activities. Originally from 
	Australia, Bridges had never attained citizenship and remained officially an 
	alien. Being a labor radical, this fact put him in great jeopardy. The 1939 
	trial lasted nine-and-a-half weeks and produced a 7,724 page transcript.<a name="_ednref68" title href="#_edn68"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[68]</span></a> However, despite the extensive effort by the government, Bridges escaped 
	unscathed. This was for a number of reasons but mainly due to the fact that, 
	by a stroke of luck, the chair of the hearing was Dean Landis of Harvard 
	University. Landis doubted (rightly) the legitimacy of the government’s 
	witnesses and appeared to have an admiration for the accused, engaging in 
	friendly, “long philosophical discussions” with Bridges while he was on the

	waged for control of the IWA. Perhaps this was to remind the rank-and-file

	during the upheaval and expressed support for Pritchett and his policies. 
	Judging form the articles in the <i>Timberworker</i>, a majority of the

	This was a fateful move. Instead of being a savior, Germer became the wedge

	plotting the ouster of Pritchett.<a name="_ednref91" title href="#_edn91"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[91]</span></a> Sworn affidavits of those involved indicated that the CIO was knowingly

	union, and had been an active participant in the Canadian labor movement 
	with the IWW. When Mr. Roebuck became ill, because he was on relief he did 
	not receive proper medical care and was condemned to the “X ward,” a 
	basement ward reserved for relief patients. Roebuck died in Pritchett’s 
	arms, weighing only eighty pounds. At the funeral, rightfully indignant 
	about the care Roebuck had received, Pritchett stated “that [the] working 
	people would look forward to the day when such untimely deaths were not 
	necessary.”<a name="_ednref99" title href="#_edn99"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[99]</span></a> 
	After the body was lowered into the ground, those gathered sang the Red 
	International. Now, six years later, Pritchett and his family were being 
	denied the privilege to live in the United States based on this obituary.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%; margin-right: .7pt">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">The 
	official reasons for denial were that Pritchett failed to prove 
	non-immigrant status (because he had lived in the U.S. almost continually on 
	visitor's permits since 1936 as he conducted union business) and that he 
	would compromise public safety (because of subversive activities).<a name="_ednref100" title href="#_edn100"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[100]</span></a> Communism may have been the reason for this “deportation” on the surface, 
	but as the <i>Timberworker</i> editorialized after the news, the IWA was in 
	the midst of a significant drive to organize the Southern timber industry 
	and anti-labor factions desired to prevent the expansion of the powerful 
	leftist labor movement.<a name="_ednref101" title href="#_edn101"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[101]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 120%; margin-right: .7pt">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">Stuck 
	in Vancouver, BC, Pritchett could not attend the Fourth Annual Convention of 
	the IWA. After legal alternatives failed, it was clear that Harold Pritchett 
	was not going to be allowed legally into the United States for quite some 
	time and that he would be unable to fulfill his duties as president of the 
	International Woodworkers of America.<a name="_ednref102" title href="#_edn102"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[102]</span></a> 
	And so, with great frustration, Pritchett tendered his resignation to the 
	Executive Board, reported first in the November 30, 1940 issue of the <i>
	Timberworker</i>, then officially in the December 7, 1940 edition. Vice 
	President O.M. Orton stepped up to fill the position until the elections the 
	following year. In his official letter of resignation, Harold Pritchett 
	wrote,</span></p>

	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial"> Despite the rocky path his three years as president of the IWA had taken, 
	Pritchett’s term can be considered a success. Membership grew markedly 
	during his tenure; the IWA waged several successful strikes and established 
	a powerful collective bargaining presence; Pritchett was able to run the IWA 
	in his militant, leftist style. Essentially, at least up until 1940, he was 
	realizing his vision of a radical union that would truly represent its 
	membership.<a name="_ednref104" title href="#_edn104"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[104]</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 37.4pt; line-height: 120%; margin-right: .7pt">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">In 
	Canada, Pritchett continued his work for the labor movement wholeheartedly. 
	Outside the reach of American reactionaries, Pritchett’s radical tactics 
	could proceed relatively unmolested. Canada was more conducive to organizing 
	at the time due to its capital intensive industries and a severely exploited 
	workforce.<a name="_ednref105" title href="#_edn105"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[105]</span></a> He became president of the IWA’s British Columbia District 1 and joined the 
	leadership of the Labor Progressive Party, a communist equivalent which did 
	not advocate violence or force.<a name="_ednref106" title href="#_edn106"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[106]</span></a> 
	Throughout the 1940s, he continued in the vanguard of the struggle of the 
	red-versus-white war that was just reaching full force in the United States. 
	In 1948, Pritchett helped lead a leftist break from the IWA with the 
	formation the Woodworkers Industrial Union of Canada (WIUC). Many parallels 
	between the 1937 IWA split from the AFL and the formation of the WIUC were 
	drawn, and just like the Communist control of the IWA, it was short lived.<a name="_ednref107" title href="#_edn107"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[107]</span></a> It fell apart in 1951, bringing down Pritchett’s career as a labor organizer 
	with it. Although he tried multiple times to gain re-entry, Harold Pritchett 
	was never again permitted to be a member of the IWA. Returning to his 
	original roots, Pritchett lived out the rest of his working life as a sawyer 
	and shingle weaver.<a name="_ednref108" title href="#_edn108"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[108]</span></a> 
	Harold Pritchett died in 1982.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 37.4pt; line-height: 120%; margin-right: .7pt">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">In 
	the IWA, the coercive tactics of Germer and Hartung proved successful in the 
	end as the White Bloc assumed control and reformed the union in Pritchett’s 
	absence. As the 1940’s progressed, it became clear that the battle for the 
	IWA had been one of the first in the overall reform of the CIO and the labor 
	movement. According to historians Jerry Lembcke and William Tattam, John L. 
	Lewis, despite his superficial support for Pritchett, had actually backed 
	the Pritchett “deportation” and was behind the CRDC takeover (Hartung was 
	finally elected President of the IWA in 1943).<a name="_ednref109" title href="#_edn109"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[109]</span></a> Harold Pritchett had been one of the first casualties of the “Second Red 
	Scare” that would continue in the United States deep into the 1950s.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 37.4pt; line-height: 120%; margin-right: .7pt">
	  <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">But 
	as one reads through Harold Pritchett’s history, what emerges is not a 
	violent&nbsp; Communist who desired to overthrow the capitalist government. 
	Rather, Pritchett was a man who gave his life's work to helping working 
	people. For him, the best way was the Left way, but it really wasn’t a 
	political issue for Pritchett, it was a human one. Time and time again, 
	Pritchett stressed unity in the movement and the power of the rank-and-file. 
	For Pritchett, being a woodworker was the harsh reality of the job. This 
	reality transcended politics, but politics was also a reality, and it was a 
	game Pritchett was willing to play.</span><span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
