    <p>	Radical Women is a socialist feminist organization founded in the late 1960s that grew out of the Freedom Socialist Party, but only included women. Radical Women identified the root of gay and female oppression in the heterosexual monogamous family, which they viewed as the basic social unit necessary to support a capitalist political economy.  That is, they viewed capitalism and patriarchy as inextricably linked and sought the defeat of both.  Radical Women continues today with socialist feminist politics that also take into account racial oppression and gender identity issues.

Their grassroots campaign targeted minority neighborhoods and  forged a connection between Initiative 13 and Initiative 15, which granted  police officers greater discretion to use firearms with its passage.</p></td>
