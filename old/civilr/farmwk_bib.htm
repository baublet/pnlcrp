      <p class="arial10">This bibliography includes the major  primary and secondary sources for research on farm labor organizing and the Chicana/o Movement in the State of Washington.</p>
      <p class="arial12"><strong> General Document and Image Collections: </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10">In Yakima, two collections have perhaps the most useful material on farm labor activism and the Chicana/o Movement: The Click Relander Collection and the Documents Collection at the Sundquist Research Library. Click Relander, former editor and author in Yakima collected a vast personal library related to Pacific Northwest history, and especially the history of the local American Indian population in Central Washington. Originally sold to a bookstore in Seattle and later purchased by anonymous donors, the collection was returned to Yakima where it is presently housed at the Yakima Valley Regional Library. Though rich in documents concerning the local history in the Yakima Valley, there was only one folder with material on labor. Nothing was found on movements post-1950.</p>
      <p class="arial10">Likewise, the Sundquist Research Library at the Yakima Valley Museum offers similar material. Though still in the process of organization, the library has an incredible wealth of material ranging from original clippings of newspaper articles concerning Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) activity in 1933, to formation of the United Farm Workers (UFW) and campaigns around farm worker housing in the late 1990s. Most material on the history of Chicana/o activism still overlaps with farm labor activism and is still small in comparison to other topics.</p>
      <p class="arial10">In the Seattle area, many of the document collections are at the University of Washington&rsquo;s main campus. One archive housed at the UW&rsquo;s Ethnic Cultural Center is the MEChA de University of Washington Document Collection which includes journals, organizational documents, resolutions, newsletters, position papers, photographs and random ephemera from 1968 up to the present day. Some of these documents may also be found on the Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chicana/o Movement in Washington State&rdquo; Special Section, produced in collaboration with MEChA de UW. </p>
      <p class="arial10">A few notable collected works at University of Washington Libraries&rsquo; Special Collections area include The Tomas Ybarra-Frausto Papers, Teresa de Aragon de Shepro Papers, and Roberto Garfias Papers, all of whom are former faculty members at UW&rsquo;s &lsquo;Centro de Estudios Chicanos.&rsquo; The aforementioned collections include material ranging from the Chicana/o Student Movement, to Chicano Studies, the visual arts, literature, performance art (Teatro del Piojo and Teatro Quetzalcoatl), as well as educational equity and the emergence of UFWOC activity in Washington State. In addition, the collections also have important documents pertaining to the evolution of Urban Chicana/o Activism in Seattle. Specifically activity surrounding the development of Las Chicanas, MEChA, El Centro de La Raza, Activos Mexicanos, the Brown Berets (UW and Yakima Valley Chapters), as well as a host of others.</p>
      <p class="arial10">Other collections housed at UW Libraries also include the Office of Minority Affairs&rsquo; Records (which also include some MEChA de UW, Chicano EOP, and other documents). UW Libraries also offers additional sources on farm labor organizing in Washington&rsquo;s Yakima Valley during the first half of the 20 th century, in particular the efforts of the Industrial Workers of the World&rsquo;s (IWW) Agricultural Workers Organization (later renamed the Agricultural Workers Industrial Union) in fighting free speech battles and organizing migrant workers in the fruit industry. Of note is the James G. Newbill: Research Materials on Yakima Valley Labor History, 1909-2001 (includes original research and interviews with participants of the IWW and the &ldquo;Battle at Congdon Orchards&rdquo; of 1933), the Claire Litchman Papers (relative of Mark M. Litchman, ACLU lawyer hired to represent IWW workers arrested in Yakima), the ACLU Papers, as well as the Cannery Workers and Farm Laborers Union Local 7 papers. </p>
      <p class="arial10">The Manuscript and Special Collections (MASC) Division at Washington State University also offer a wealth of knowledge as far as images and special documents that relate to the Chicana/o presence in Pullman. The two collections that stand out most are the Irwin Nash: Photographs of Yakima Valley Migrant Labor, 1967-1976 collection (the collection includes photos of migrants, camps and facilities, cultural projects, UW&rsquo;s El Teatro del Piojo, UW Chicano Studies meetings, MEChA de UW, UW Grape Boycott, UFW, Cesar Chavez, etc.). Yet another collection in MASC at WSU Libraries is the WSU Chicano Archive, unveiled in late March of 2008. The new addition is perhaps the most comprehensive Chicano Archive in Eastern Washington and the best source concerning the history of the Chicana/o population in Pullman (since the 1950s) and subsequent student movements at WSU (1970-early 2000s).</p>
      <p class="arial10">Perhaps the largest collections both on farm labor and urban activist history can be found at the Walter Reuther Library&rsquo;s Archive of Labor and Urban affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, home of both the UFW and IWW Archives respectively. The Reuther Library also happens to be the largest Labor archive in North America, and holds more than 2000 collections relating to topics such as union history, working class organizations, Women and African Americans in the labor movement as well as extensive collections on radical social movements. </p>

      <p class="arial12"><strong>Online Archival Material: </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10">In addition to physical image and document collections, there are also archives found online that range from labor history to visual art movements in Washington&rsquo;s Chicana/o and Latina/o community. One such source is the Chicano/Latino Archive hosted by The Evergreen State College Library. This research and teaching collection focuses on Chicano and Latino art in the Pacific Northwest, activity mostly during the 1970s and 1980s which ran parallel to literary and performance art movements and helped incorporate visual arts as a tool for expressing the goals of the Chicana/o Movement. Included in the archive is a guide to the original &ldquo;Chicano/Latino Artists in the Pacific Northwest&rdquo; exhibit (1984-86), an article from the UW-produced &ldquo;Metamorfosis&rdquo; journal on the state of the art movement, and an exhibit catalog, among others. </p>
      <p class="arial10">Another archive in Western Washington south of Seattle are the Columbia River Basin Ethnic History Archives at Washington State University, Vancouver Campus. The project itself is done in collaboration with the Idaho, Oregon and Washington State Historical Societies, as well as with the WSU-Pullman. The project focus is to highlight the presence of the oft ignored ethnic minority groups in the tri-state Columbia River Basin region (Western and Southwestern Idaho, Northern Oregon, Southern and South-Central Washington). </p>
      <p class="arial10">The more general of this set of archives is HistoryLink.org, The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History. The site itself is funded largely by the State of Washington, King County, the City of Seattle, the Seattle Public Library, the 4 Culture program in King County, the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI), and a set of other donors. Though a general reference of Washington State history, the site itself includes many essays on Chicano/Latino history as well as farm labor organizing, ranging from Spanish Expeditions into what is now Washington parting from Mexico&rsquo;s West Coast (1774), to the introduction of Mexican <em>Braceros</em> in the Yakima Valley (1942), to the roots of Seattle&rsquo;s Immigrant Rights Movement (1999), and the May Day marches in Seattle and Yakima (2006).</p>
      <p class="arial10">The University of Washington also houses two research units associated with Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies. Created in 2004, the United Farm Workers in Washington State History Project documents the formation and evolution of farm labor history in the Yakima Valley from the late 1960s to the present (the unit is also undergoing an expansion). Of note are transcripts of interviews, a photo essay history of the UFW as seen through images donated by long time labor activist, Tomas Villanueva, as well as a page with external links to sites of interest. </p>
      <p class="arial10">The other of these two archives is the Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project. Within the archive is the &ldquo;Chicana/o Movement in Washington State History Project&rdquo; which was initiated in 2005 with the aid of a group of undergraduate researchers connected to MEChA de UW. The section includes a history timeline, a collection of oral histories, a page containing photo collections donated, a slide show, a historical narrative, a list of digitized newspaper articles and a special documents collection from MEChA de UW&rsquo;s archive. </p>
      <p class="arial10">The last archive listed is the An Oral History Of The Crewport Farm Labor Camp project produced for the Center for Columbia River History, a unit produced in collaboration between Washington State University and Yakima Valley Community College. The Crewport archive includes a historical narrative created by then YVCC Professor, Mario C. Compean, a list of oral history interviews, a photo essay as well as a set of documents. </p>

      <p class="arial12"><strong> Books: </strong></p>
      <p class="arial10"><strong> &nbsp;</strong>There have been several books written on both Chicanas/os as well as farm labor history in the Northwest. Below is a brief list of full length studies. Of said sources, Alaniz and Hall have a broader focus as they look at subject matter in a larger regional and national context, yet both offer detailed narrative of activity in the northwest (Alaniz includes two appendices documenting UFW activity in Washington and the 1975 Student Strike at UW. Hall writes about IWW activity in Yakima in the late 1910s, Free Speech battles as well as the eventual suppression of early IWW activity by way of legislation such as the sedition act of 1917 and Criminal Syndicalism legislation). Likewise, Garcia (Gilberto), Gamboa and Swantes incorporate a regional Northwestern analysis. Garcia (Jerry) and Flores are more specific to Washington State.</p>
