    <p class="arial10">The story of LGBTQ Seattle is over 130 years in the making.&nbsp; In the 1880s same-sex relations were of  little concern to most residents.&nbsp; Later,  in 1893, they were declared a crime, and in the late 1960s, activists  politically organized around same-sex intimacy.&nbsp;  Gay Seattleites fought for nondiscrimination in the 1970s. Transgender activists likewise fought for inclusion in Seattle's nondiscrimination ordinances in the 1980s. &nbsp; From the 1880s through today,  Seattle&rsquo;s LGBTQ history has been about laws, morality, understanding, cultural  and political expressions, and city space.&nbsp;  At the heart of Seattle&rsquo;s LGBTQ history are people, those who have persecuted  same-sex sexuality, those who have challenged heterosexist oppression, and  those who wanted to live a life free of persecution and judgment.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="arial10">This essay explores Seattle&rsquo;s gay history from the late 19th century up to 2012. It was commissioned by and appears here courtesy of the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/" target="_blank">Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest.</a></p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong> Vice, the Tenderloin, and  Rehabilitation</strong> </p>
    <p class="arial10">      When  Arthur Denny and his colonizing party landed on Alki Point in 1851, the Puget  Sound area was already part of a larger indigenous and Euro-American  economy.&nbsp; The base of this economy was  organized around extracting resources, especially timber, and shipping these  materials across the area.&nbsp; In 1880,  Seattle had a humble population of about 3,500, but the growing town serviced a  sizeable number of migrant laborers who worked in the timber industry or as  casual workers in numerous jobs.&nbsp;  Boarding houses, bars, gambling dens, and brothels soon became  concentrated in the section south of Yesler Way, what is today Pioneer  Square.&nbsp; The Tenderloin (as it was known  then) gained a reputation for vice, including various sexual practices.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Transient  worker life was governed by a different set of codes and standards than those  of Seattle&rsquo;s middle- and upper-class people.&nbsp;  Sexuality for transient men and youths was largely organized on a  jock-punk relationship, in which the older man (jock) was the penetrator during  interfemural (between the thighs) or anal sex with the youth (punk).&nbsp; The available evidence from transient  networks across the Pacific Northwest suggests that men and youths entered into  sexual relations with each other to gain protection and material goods for the  youth and sexual release in the absence of women for the older man.&nbsp; Transient male-male intimacy was not  necessarily labeled as gay or homosexual by contemporaries, but was instead seen  as a threat to the ideals of a heteronormative family and Christian values of  Seattle&rsquo;s moral guardians.</p>
    <p class="arial10">In 1893,  Seattle not only gained the Great Northern transcontinental railroad line, but it  also took a stand against sodomy.&nbsp; For  reasons not entirely clear, the Washington state legislature passed an antisodomy  law in February of 1893.&nbsp; Referred  to as a &ldquo;crime against nature,&rdquo; <em>sodomy</em> was a term that could apply to anal or oral sex for both hetero- and  homosexuals.&nbsp; Sodomy could also mean bestiality  and other forms of nonprocreative sex.&nbsp;  However, the law was applied almost exclusively to male-male sexual acts,  and breaking this law could result in a sentence twice as long as the punishment for  heterosexual rape.&nbsp; When  the 1897 Klondike gold rush was underway, Seattle officials seemed to turn a  blind eye on male same-sex relations.&nbsp;  Just four years after the disastrous Panic of 1893, the city was  profiting by providing supplies, rest, food, and entertainment in the  Tenderloin to miners traveling to and from Alaska.&nbsp; As the Klondike gold rush slowed down,  however, the city of Seattle began to seriously crack down on men having  consensual sex when Kenneth Mackintosh was elected chief prosecutor in  1904.&nbsp; His deputy, George Vanderveer,  took a particular interest in suppressing male-male sexual behavior in the Tenderloin, and Vanderveer replaced Mackintosh as chief prosecutor in 1908.</p>
    <p class="arial10">During  these early investigations into same-sex sexual relations, not every  participant was <em>homosexual</em>.&nbsp; In the late 19th and early 20th  century, the term &quot;homosexual&quot; implied an effeminate male who desired sex with other men.&nbsp; In 1918, Progressive physician and  diagnostician Lilburn Merrill wrote an academic article on juvenile delinquents  in Seattle.&nbsp; In this report, Merrill  concluded that the male youths who were sexually involved with men or boys were  not homosexual.&nbsp; Instead, Merrill believed  that these young men were resorting to same-sex relations out of material necessity,  but they preferred sex with women.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="arial10">The first documented person who might be considered transgender in Seattle was Nell Pickerell, who  went by the name Harry Allen. Nell/Harry was written about in <em>The Seattle Times</em>, which identified her as a woman; however, Nell passed as Harry, working many men's jobs, including serving as a bartender and a farmhand. The first story about Nell appeared in 1901. Pickerell was arrested numerous times, including once for transporting a protsitute, who was Harry's partner at the time, across state lines from Portland.    </p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>An Emerging Community</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">      It was not  until the 1930s that a visible gay Seattle began to emerge.&nbsp; Like other gay communities across the United  States, Seattle&rsquo;s formed within the context of industrialization.&nbsp;  From 1880 to 1930, Seattle&rsquo;s population grew from about 3,500 to an  incredible 365,588, a 10,353 percent jump.&nbsp;  Although gay individuals lived in rural areas, cities provided  opportunities for men and women to escape the supervision of their families and  neighbors, allowing for the possibility of forming distinct identities,  communities, and cultures.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Men and  women often looked for same-sex intimate partners in bars, yet the combination  of Prohibition (1919-1933) and increased prosecution of sodomy cases during the  Progressive Era made this possibility difficult.&nbsp; In 1930, Joseph Bellotti opened the Casino  Pool Hall, which allowed same-sex dancing.&nbsp;  Patrons nicknamed the hall &ldquo;Madame Peabody&rsquo;s School of  Dance&rdquo; as a code phrase that described what visitors practiced. &nbsp;When Prohibition ended in 1933, bars catering  to men seeking sex with men began to open.&nbsp;  Bellotti then opened the Double Header bar above the Casino Pool Hall in  1934, believed to be the nation&rsquo;s oldest continuously operating gay bar until its closure in on December 31, 2015.&nbsp; These bars were heavily concentrated in the  Tenderloin/Pioneer Square area, and were welcoming to lesbians as well.&nbsp; Many working-class gay men and lesbians who  could be considered the first stalwarts of Seattle&rsquo;s gay community frequented  these spaces.&nbsp; Some middle-class  individuals entered the bar in hopes of an anonymous sexual encounter without  compromising their identity in their daily life.&nbsp; The Tenderloin was slowly developing a gay  community where people drank together and sought same-sex companionship.</p>
    <p class="arial10">World War  II was a particularly important event in crystallizing gay identities and urban  gay communities, particularly in port cities such as Seattle.&nbsp; While gay communities  were already forming prior to the war, mass urbanization and industrialization during  World War II brought many people together in the armed services and defense  industries.&nbsp; Many men with homosexual  tendencies met one another in the service and went in and out of major port  cities that had visible and developed gay subcultures, while women with  sexual interest in othe women could meet in wartime factories.&nbsp; For men, same-sex sexual relationships during  the war were hidden so that friends and family would not think negatively of  them.&nbsp; Also, if a serviceman was accused  of being gay, he faced the real possibility of a dishonorable discharge and  declared ineligible for veteran (GI) benefits.&nbsp;  Women in the armed forces faced similar consequences if they were  accused of same-sex intimacy.    </p>
    <p class="arial10">Following  the war, gay venues proliferated not only in Pioneer Square, but also in other areas  of downtown, including First and Second Avenues.&nbsp; While not every tavern was   gender-integrated, gay men and lesbians largely belonged to the same community  and could feel comfortable visiting establishments that might cater to the  opposite sex, as they had during the Great Depression.&nbsp; Seattle&rsquo;s first bars catering explicitly to  lesbians sprung up during the 1950s.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Drag  performances quickly became a  central feature of the gay community, first appearing in vaudeville  performances as early as 1898, when the nationally recognized female  impersonator Edward Stewart performed in a Seattle Theater production of <em>1492</em>.&nbsp;   The Garden of Allah, a gay cabaret located on  First Avenue between University and Seneca Streets that opened in 1946, became a central venue for drag performances in the postwar period.&nbsp; The Garden of Allah was of particular  importance in fostering Seattle&rsquo;s gay community until its doors closed in  1956.&nbsp; This venue was the first gay-owned  cabaret in Seattle, and many of its visitors were heterosexual tourists and  military servicemen who came to see its famed drag performers, including Skippy  LaRue and Jewel Box Revue.&nbsp; In addition to being a drag performer, Skippy LaRue  founded at least two boarding houses for gay men.&nbsp; Drag performances during this time often provided social  commentaries on heteronormative culture.&nbsp; The military thought differently of drag  performers and The Garden of Allah.&nbsp; During  the Lavender Scare of the Cold War, the armed services banned personnel from  visiting such venues, arguing that homosexuality&mdash;and by association, drag&mdash;would  place servicemen in danger of being blackmailed by communists.</p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>Bribes and the Law</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">      Gay bars  in Seattle were not raided or otherwise harassed by the police as often as they  were in most major cities with a large gay presence, such as San Francisco and  New York.&nbsp; The reason for this was that some  officers of the Seattle Police Department forced institutions, including gay  bars, to pay them off.&nbsp; As long as the  bar owners paid, the police left the bars alone.&nbsp; For example, Golden Horseshoe owners Joe  McGonagle and Jake Heimbigner agreed to pay the police $100 a month to ignore  drag shows and an extra $50 a week to overlook same-sex dancing.&nbsp; Operators of  bath houses catering to gay men  also paid off the police.&nbsp; With the  safety provided by the payoffs for patrons of gay spaces, the number of gay bars increased dramatically  in the 1960s in Pioneer&rsquo;s Square and into the Central Business District.&nbsp; The police even  bargained with gay business owners MacIver Wells and Jake Heimbigner to open a  new after-hours gay dance club in 1965.</p>
    <p class="arial10">It was  Madison Tavern owner MacIver Wells who exposed the police payoff system by  cooperating with the FBI over a seven-year period, keeping records of payments  paid to police officers and the officers involved.&nbsp; However, when the story broke in the <em>Seattle Times</em> in 1966, the reporters did  not indict corrupt police officers but instead remarked on Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;homosexual  problem.&rdquo;&nbsp; A year later in  1967, the <em>Seattle Times</em> gave more  details about police bribes after reporters were thrown out of the police  chief&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; By  the early 1970s, some, but not all, of the corrupt officers were put on trial and  convicted of receiving bribes and payoffs.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Seattle Police Chief George Tielsch was hired to reform the police force following the payoff system. Tielsch had a particular penchant for policing vice crimes, which resulted in a greater policing of gay life than had existed under the payoff system. This brought Tielsch into conflict with Mayor Wes Uhlman, who signed Seattle's employment nondiscrimination ordinance including sexual minorities in 1973. As a result, Tielsch resigned his position in March 1974.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Despite  the toleration and even promotion of gay bars on the part of police, gay men  were still vulnerable to sodomy convictions.&nbsp;  Keith Rhinehart founded the Seattle Aquarian Church and promoted the  right of individuals to sexual privacy regardless of preference.&nbsp; The church grew to more than 600  members.&nbsp; Despite shaky testimony and  conflicting evidence, Rhinehart was convicted of sodomy in 1965.&nbsp; The trial hinged on the multiple confessions  and recantations of James Miller, a man alleged to have intercourse with Rhinehart.&nbsp; Seven years after his incarceration, Rhinehart  was finally released in 1972.&nbsp; Rhinehart  was one of the last people convicted of sodomy&mdash;Governor Dan Evans signed a bill  that decriminalized the act in 1976.    </p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>Gay Liberation</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">      The widely  accepted beginning of the Gay Liberation movement was late June 1969 when  patrons of the Stonewall Inn in New York City fought back against a routine  police raid.&nbsp; Seattle had few raids because  of the police payoff system.&nbsp; Regardless,  the Seattle gay community quickly adopted <em>Gay  Liberation</em>: the philosophy that same-sex sexuality should be open and celebrated rather than hidden and persecuted.&nbsp; Seattle was one of a handful of cities&mdash;also  including Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles&mdash;that commemorated the first  anniversary of the Stonewall riots.&nbsp; To this day, Seattle holds Gay Pride Week the last week of June along with New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, in commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. </p>
    <p class="arial10">Seattle&rsquo;s  first gay organization, the Dorian Society, predated Stonewall by two  years.&nbsp; Formed in 1967, the Dorian  Society sought to serve the gay community and educate mainstream Seattleites on  homosexuality.&nbsp; In one of its first  public acts, the group worked with the  <em>Seattle</em> magazine and placed Peter Wichern, a gay businessman, on the  cover.&nbsp; Wichern and the Dorian Society  signaled a different homosexual lifestyle from the Tenderloin, one more  palatable to middle-class Seattleites.&nbsp; In a picnic sponsored in part by the group,  attendees were not allowed to wear drag, an indication that the Dorian Society  was trying to move away from certain forms of gay cultural expression to achieve respectability in the eyes of hetersexual residents.&nbsp; The society opened a house in 1969  that served as a de facto gay community center on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; The house provided counseling services and  employment help for gay Seattleites.&nbsp; The  Seattle Counseling Services for Sexual Minorities emerged out of the Dorian  House, the first organization of its kind in the United States.    </p>
    <p class="arial10">During the  era of the civil rights movement and Vietnam War (1960s-70s), Seattle&rsquo;s gay  activists and lobbyists were transforming Seattle into a city increasingly  tolerant of homosexuality.&nbsp; After the Stonewall riots  and with increasing momentum generated by Gay Liberation activists, Mayor Wes  Uhlman declared the city&rsquo;s first official &ldquo;Gay Pride Week&rdquo; in 1977.&nbsp; Organizations dedicated to gay pride included  the Union of Sexual Minorities, the Gay Women&rsquo;s Alliance, the Seattle Counseling  Service, the Gay Community Center,  Seattle&rsquo;s chapter of the Gay Liberation Front, Stonewall (a drug and alcohol  rehabilitation center), and the Lesbian Resource Center.&nbsp; The language of power, pride, and freedom from  oppression from the civil rights movement influenced many of these   organizations.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Sexual  minorities gained a major legal victory with the passage of city ordinances  banning employment and housing discrimination against sexual minorities in 1973  and 1975, respectively.&nbsp; Seattle  voters defeated a city referendum challenging both ordinances, Initiative 13,  in 1978.&nbsp; Along with  the defeat of the Briggs Initiative in California, which would have banned homosexuals  from teaching, these were the first democratic defeats of antigay initiatives  that sprung up beginning in 1977.&nbsp;  Proponents of Initiative 13 argued that gays were not a minority group  that required legal protection like women, blacks, Latinos, Asians, Native  Americans, and other ethnic and racial groups.&nbsp;  Led by a Seattle police officers David Estes and Dennis Falk, the group Save Our Moral  Ethics (SOME) led the effort to overturn nondiscrimination for sexual minorities.&nbsp;  Countering SOME were three main organizations: Women Against Thirteen, the Seattle Committee Against Thirteen, the Citizens to  Retain Fair Employment (CRFE).&nbsp;  Despite disagreements over political messages and tactics between the first two organizations and CRFE, gay activists defeated SOME and Initiative 13 on November 7, 1978, with Seattle voters rejecting the initiative by a near two-to-one margin. </p>
    <p class="arial10">Gay  communities nationwide were known for their gender divisions during the 1970s,  and Seattle was no exception.&nbsp; While the  older generation in Pioneer Square was largely gender-integrated, the new  generation of Gay Liberationists and lesbian feminists did not always see  eye-to-eye.&nbsp; As the younger generation of  gay men established institutions on Capitol Hill, lesbian feminists  sought to create exclusively lesbian spaces in the  University District.&nbsp; Decrying &ldquo;gay  patriarchy,&rdquo; they sought their own separate enclaves where women could focus on  issues that affected them in particular, especially rape and sexual harassment.&nbsp;  The Gay Women&rsquo;s Resource Center (later Lesbian Resource Center) was  established out of the University District YWCA in 1971.&nbsp; The goal of this center was to provide a  space where women could identify their sexuality and remove &ldquo;lesbian oppression&rdquo;  from their lives.&nbsp; Some  lesbian and feminist groups believed that separatism (living, organizing, and  socializing with women only) was the answer to ending male dominance, yet the  Union of Sexual Minorities, a coalition of gay men and women who shared anti-racist and anti-imperialist views, believed this approach to be shortsighted because  society is composed of both women and men.&nbsp; Meanwhile, many gay men injected a  domineering and aggressive masculinity into gay culture unseen before the Gay  Liberation movement.&nbsp; Tensions were  evident in the 1980 Lesbian and Gay Pride March.</p>
    <p class="arial10">Throughout  the Gay Liberation movement, religion played a part in the debates.&nbsp; There were three main Christian camps: those who  believed gays were children of God, those who argued  homosexuals could&mdash;and should&mdash;change their sexuality through faith, and others  who declared homosexuality was a sin of the highest order.&nbsp; The United Church of Christ and Metropolitan  Community Church embraced and preached to gays and lesbians.&nbsp; The Methodist Church was split in its  approach to homosexuals, with the conservative regional Pacific Northwest  governing body disagreeing with the open Seattle church.&nbsp; The Catholic Church was also split in  spreading the gospel to gays.&nbsp; The  Vatican was thoroughly against supporting any gay issues or priests that did  not declare homosexuality as evil.&nbsp;  Seattle Catholic priests, however, were much more accepting of  homosexuals.&nbsp; Archbishop Raymond  Hunthausen hosted a conference of the gay Catholic organization Dignity in 1983  at St. James Cathedral, prompting the Vatican to closely observe the Seattle  Archdiocese.</p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong> Race and Class</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">      While  Pioneer Square and First Avenue were the center of gay entertainment, many gay  residents moved to Capitol Hill as post-World War II suburbanization attracted  wealthy and upper middle class Capitol Hill families to the suburbs.&nbsp; Several larger homes were subdivided into  separate units or became communal homes inhabited by countercultural youth and  gay &ldquo;families,&rdquo; a group of gay people living together in a tight-knit  community.&nbsp; The expansion of the African  American population in the adjacent Central District during and after World War  II also made the southern part of Capitol Hill less attractive to more  well-to-do white residents, driving rents down and thereby making the area more  affordable for gay residents.</p>
    <p class="arial10">The Union of Sexual Minorities, which was active in the mid-to-late 1970s, carried on the politics of the ealry gay liberation movement, connecting the oppression of sexual minorities with other oppressed peoples. Their politics were explicitly anti-racist and anti-imperialist. The organization Black and White Men Together, now called Men of All Colors and Cultures Together, formed to fight racism within the gay community in the late 1970s.  The Seattle Urban League, an African American organization, leased space in its building in the Central District for the Gay Community Center in the late 1970s, and the Central District voted against Initiative 13 at a higher rate than any other neighborhood in Seattle in 1978.</p>
    <p class="arial10">The Gay  Liberation movement made it easier for middle-class men to identify as gay  without fear of discrimination, especially after the passage of Seattle&rsquo;s  employment and housing non-discrimination ordinances.&nbsp; As in other parts of the U.S. after  Stonewall, gay residential and business areas formed around white middle-class  gay men.&nbsp; The Greater Seattle Business Association was formed in 1981 to foster gay  patronage of gay businesses.&nbsp; Members  sought to establish a gay commercial district along Broadway on Capitol Hill,  though they never succeeded in creating the kind of strip like San Francisco&rsquo;s  Castro Street or Los Angeles&rsquo;s Santa Monica Boulevard.&nbsp; By the early 1990s, GSBA's focus expanded beyond the gay  community, welcoming allies and asserting gay people&rsquo;s equality via their  purchasing power.&nbsp;The role gay businesses played in the economic recovery of the Capitol Hill neighborhood in the 1980s made the GSBA and its members in the neigborhood welcome players in neighborhood politics.</p>
    <p class="arial10">The Pike/Pine Corridor, bordering  Capitol Hill and the Central District was a particularly contentious area in which the growth of the gay community came into direct contact with the historical center of African American life in Seattle.&nbsp; As econonic development and demographic growth pushed racial  and ethnic minorities south, social divisions emerged  among former residents and the gay community, perceived as white and middle-class.&nbsp; The Pike/Pine Planning Study, which brought together varoius organizations and financial support from the City of Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund to study the development of the Pike/Pine Corridor, includes the gay community as belonging to the area while ignoring the historical presence of African Americans.   Gentrification of this  once highly accessible area  produced  tensions with a gay community viewed as exclusively white and middle class by the early 1990s.</p>
    <p class="arial10">A  number of organizations have been formed in recent years to address the needs and increase the visibility of sexual minorities of distinct racial and cultural backgrounds. Entre Hermanos formed in 1991 to promote the health and well-being of LGBTQ Latinos. Pride Asia empowers and nurtures the diversity of LGBTQ Asians and Pacific Islanders, and Trikone Northwest provides support, education, and political space for LGBTQ+ South Asians in Seattle. The Center for Multicultural Health sponsors Emerald City Black Pride, which promotes sexual health and well-being Black LGBTQ Seattleites. Noor provides a meeting space for LGBTQI people who have ever identified as Muslim. </p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>AIDS Awareness</strong> </p>
    <p class="arial10">      Signs of  AIDS preceded the first diagnosed case in Seattle in November 1982, but Seattle  never received the kind of attention around &ldquo;gay cancer&rdquo; or GRID (Gay-Related  Immuno-Deficiency) that Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York did.&nbsp; AIDS was known, named, and linked to gay men  by the time the first case received attention in Seattle.&nbsp; The city council promptly set aside funds for  AIDS treatment and research, becoming the second municipality in the United  States to do so in 1983.&nbsp; Gender  divisions softened during the 1980s.&nbsp;  More lesbian spaces opened on Capitol Hill, including communal  houses.&nbsp; Many lesbians became involved in  AIDS activism, often as caregivers for sick gay men in the group Chicken Soup  Brigade.&nbsp; The Northwest AIDS Foundation  (NWAF) gained a seat at the table with Seattle-King County Public Health (SKCDPH) in the  mid-1980s and received funding from SKCDPH for outreach in the gay community.&nbsp; ACTUP (AIDS Coalition to  Unleash Power) first formed in New York City as a radical protest organization  that sought to draw more public attention and funds to AIDS research in 1987,  and the ACTUP chapter in Seattle was quite active by decade&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; For example, they picketed centers of  clinical trials for AIDS treatment, demanding quicker trials for faster  relief.</p>
    <p class="arial10">People of  color responded to AIDS by forming organizations focusing on non-white AIDS  patients.&nbsp; One of the major groups was  the People of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN) established in 1987.&nbsp;Like NWAF, POCAAN received funding from SKCDPH for outreach to communities of color.&nbsp; The main goal of POCAAN   was to educate gay men of color about safe sex,  AIDS awareness and treatment.&nbsp; These groups provided a space where gay  people of color and AIDS patients could feel culturally welcomed.&nbsp; Specifically, Entre Hermanos addressed its  audience in Spanish and English while also combating homophobia in Latino  culture.</p>
    <p class="arial10">By the  year 2000, AIDS had claimed the lives of 3,500 Seattleites.&nbsp; Numerous gay activists passed away, including  many of those who had made gay Seattle. &nbsp;Cal  Anderson became the first gay member of the Washington State legislature when  he was appointed in 1987 to serve Seattle&rsquo;s 43rd District (central Seattle) in the state house.&nbsp;  He won election to the state senate in 1994, but served less than one  year before dying of complications related to AIDS.</p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>Trans Activism</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">Native Seattleite Marsha Botzer founded the first transgender center in the United States, the Ingersoll Gender Center, in 1979. She was inspired by counselors at the Seattle Counseling Service for Sexual Minorities, the oldest mental health counseling service specifically for sexual minorities in the United States. The center has served as a community center for transgender and gender-questioning people, and in its early days it assisted in raising funds to help transgender people get the surgeries they desired to fully transition. To this day, Ingersoll holds a support group every Wednesday night.</p>
    <p class="arial10">With the greater sense of identity and community, which Ingersoll helped generate among transgender people in Seattle, the transgender community turned to political activism. Acitivsts sought the inclusion of gender identity and expression in the City of Seattle's nondiscrimination ordinances. The annual Pride Parade  first included Bisexual and Transgender in its official title in 1992. That same year, the Seattle Commission for Lesbians and Gays became the Seattle LGBT Commisison.   Seattle added gender identity to its nondiscrimination ordinances in 1999.</p>
    <p class="arial10">While transgender identity most often involved a transition from male-to-female (MtF) or female-to-male (FtM) in the  twentieth century, today, gender fluidity and genderqueer identity are also common. To reflect this gender diversity, the term trans is used rather than transgender, a word that implies a transition from one gender to another.    </p>
    <p class="arial10">When the Washington State legislature passed a gay nondiscrimination law in 2007, trans activists, many of whom hailed from Seattle, successfully won the inclusion of language protecting people from discrimination based on gender identity and expression.</p>
    <p class="arial10">While the Ingersoll Gender Center continues to support people in the community grappling with gender identity issues, the Gender Justice League was founded in 2013 to address systemic oppression faced by trans people. GJL is particularly  concerned with intersections of social, economic and racial justice.</p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>Gay Marriage and Queer  Visions</strong> </p>
    <p class="arial10">      While marriage equality is a recent political movement, sexual minorities have ridiculed the gender exclusivity of marriage for deades. When drag performer  Jackie Starr married Bill Scott around 1950, their nuptials took place without  the permission of the state, yet legal authorization mattered little to the  newlyweds in celebrating their matrimony.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="arial10">Two decades after the Starr-Scott wedding, Gay  Liberation Front members Paul Barwick and John Singer challenged the legality  of heterosexual-only marriage by requesting a marriage license in September of  1971.&nbsp; The request was denied by King  County.&nbsp; Barwick and Singer pointed out  that Washington State law did not specify marriage as a union between a man and  a woman, so a same-sex couple should receive a marriage certificate.&nbsp; However, the Washington State  Court of Appeals ruled in 1974 that marriage was intended to be a procreative partnership.&nbsp; Barwick and Singer revealed a key logical  flaw in the court&rsquo;s ruling: What if a heterosexual couple could not have  children?&nbsp; Why should these partners be given  a marriage license while same-sex couples could not?&nbsp; These questions went unanswered for another  thirty-eight years.</p>
    <p class="arial10">While Barwick and Singer did not win their case, Seattle was the site of the first successful lesbian mothers' custody case. Madeleine Isaacson and Sandy Schuster won custody of all of their children when their husbands challenged their custody based on their sexuality by proving they maintained a respectable, religious home. The judge, however, ruled in 1972 that the two women had to live separately. With the help of the Lesbian Mothers' National Defense Fund, which formed in Seattle in 1974, they won the right to live with their children in a joint household in 1978.</p>
    <p class="arial10">In the 21st  century, marriage equality took hold of the time and resources of mainstream  gay activists.&nbsp; Washington State passed a  domestic partnership law in 2007, and gay marriage passed in 2012.&nbsp; The law formally went into effect after  Washington voters approved Proposition 74 on November 6, 2012.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="arial10">While most gay men and lesbians supported the  struggle for marriage equality, a smaller number of queer activists would  rather have seen energy and resources go to causes such as ending the bullying  of gay and queer youth.&nbsp; Many queer activists  believed marriage should not be a state institution and that same-sex  relationships should not depend on the approval of the state.&nbsp; Queer critiques also questioned if marriage  equality would apply to partners who did not fit the heteronormative concept of  a relationship and family.</p>
    <p class="arial10">In the  1980s and early 1990s, queer theory developed in academia.&nbsp; The core of queer theory critiques  the idea of an unchallenged state and fixed sexual and gender identities,  showing how each develops at certain historical points and revealing  non-heteronormative ways of living and  expression.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="arial10">The group, Queer Nation, took the ideas of queer theorists and  sought to foster a new queer politics.&nbsp;  Most Queer Nation &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; lasted only a few years, as activists did not  always share the same agenda.&nbsp; Some  members supported the liberal &ldquo;equal rights&rdquo; approach that depended on the  state for the recognition and protection of sexual minorities.&nbsp; Queer activists, on the other hand, embraced  a politics that did not support integration into mainstream society.&nbsp; These queer activists questioned the  enforcement of heteronormative behaviors and institutions.&nbsp; Seattle&rsquo;s  Queer Nation tribe was the seventh formed in the country, in August 1990, and it  lasted until 1995.&nbsp; This  activism contributed to greater awareness around bisexuality and transgender  identities as well as queer identity.</p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">      Same-sex relationships and gender non-normativity have been part of Seattle&rsquo;s history and peoples for over a century. From the  earliest cases of sodomy in the early 1890s to Referendum 74 in 2012, the  Emerald City has responded to same-sex sexuality in various, often conflicting  ways.&nbsp; Amidst changes in morality, law,  political movements, and urban landscape, Seattle&rsquo;s LGBTQ+ community has remained  steadfast in its opposition to silence. </p>
    <p class="arial10">The  history of Seattle&rsquo;s gay, lesbian, bisexual,  transgender, and queer peoples is an  ongoing historical process that is continually being rewritten as new evidence  becomes available to researchers.&nbsp; Archives  are in need of more documents to provide scholars the opportunity to compose  histories that can better reflect how the past explains Seattle&rsquo;s present. &nbsp;Paying attention to other factors that make up  a person&rsquo;s identity&mdash;especially class, race, ethnicity, and gender&mdash;will reveal a  much more complex LGBTQ community and history.&nbsp; It is our job to critically understand Seattle&rsquo;s LGBTQ+  history and question any attempt to oversimplify this history.</p>
