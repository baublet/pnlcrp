    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tyree Scott grew up in
    Texas and served in the U.S. Marine Corps before moving to Seattle in
    1966.&nbsp; When he arrived in Seattle, Scott worked for his father, who was
    an electrical contractor.&nbsp; When Model Cities, a federal antipoverty
    program led by local civil rights activist Walter Hundly, organized local
    black contractors to help them gain access to lucrative federal construction
    contracts in the Spring of1969, Tyree Scott emerged as the leader of this
    new group, the Central Contractors Association (CCA).</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;But the CCA had an
    uphill battle to fight.&nbsp; In 1966, the Washington State Board Against
    Discrimination found that Washington State’s 15 Building Trades unions,
    representing over 29,000 workers, had only 7 non-white apprentices.&nbsp;
    Despite years of complaints from CORE, the Urban League, the NAACP, and the
    Catholic Archdiocese’s Project Equality, little had changed in three years
    since that report.&nbsp; And the unions’ near-total control over the local
    labor market made it nearly impossible for both black workers and black
    contractors to find a way to benefit from large government contracts.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Frustration with unions’
    refusal to work with them, as well as federal guidelines that made it
    difficult for black contractors to get work, inspired Scott and the CCA to
    shut down federal construction sites throughout Seattle to protest their
    impossible position and demand jobs for black workers and contractors.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;Forsaking what they
    believed to be failed forms of negotiation, the CCA brought every major,
    federally funded construction site in the city of Seattle to a halt in late
    August and September of 1969.&nbsp; They did this— as other activists were
    doing in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Chicago at roughly the same time—
    by disabling equipment, blocking workers from their jobs, and demanding that
    federal civil rights law be used to force unions to hire more black
    workers.&nbsp; The most dramatic actions included running a bulldozer into a
    large open pit at the University of Washington, and marching over a hundred
    protesters onto the flight apron of Sea-Tac airport to halt air
    traffic.&nbsp; See <a href="ucwa_timeline.pdf">UCWA Timeline</a>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;The CCA’s direct
    action protests created a political firestorm that quickly pushed county,
    state, and federal officials as well as federal courts to take sides in the
    dispute between black workers and white unions.&nbsp; In Seattle, like many
    other cities around the country at the same time, these debates precipitated
    the first federal imposition of affirmative action upon local governments
    and industries.&nbsp;</font><font size="2"> </font>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;<b><a name="founding"></a>UCWA
    FOUNDING AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, 1970-72</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">By December, 1969, debate
    within the Central Contractors Association (CCA) over how to negotiate with
    unions, contractors, and government officials divided the organization
    between those who wanted to advocate for more jobs for black workers and
    those who wanted more federal contracts to go to black contractors.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tyree Scott, despite having
    worked as a contractor, left the CCA at the invitation of the Seattle Branch
    of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) to found the United
    Construction Workers Association (UCWA) in early 1970. With the AFSC’s
    financial and organizational backing, Scott shifted his attention away from
    contractors’ issues to make black construction workers’ struggles
    against union racism his sole focus.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
    UCWA’s original mission of supporting black workers encompassed a number
    of specific tasks that fused activism, social work, and political advocacy.
    It facilitated worker support and study groups; negotiated with parties on
    behalf of black workers; initiated lawsuits; and led protests that included
    non-violent direct action. See <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gregoryj/civilrights/idea.pdf">
    &quot;An Idea Whose Time Has Come: Minority Employment in the Seattle
    Construction Industry.&quot;</a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Though
    founded before the Federal District Court officially imposed affirmative
    action on the Seattle/ King County Building and Construction Trades Unions,
    the UCWA grew to demand a prominent role as enforcer of federal law and
    judicial decrees.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
    U.S. Justice Department filed suit against the unions in late 1969 following
    the CCA’s protests. On June 16, 1970, Federal District Court Judge William
    Lindberg’s ruling in U.S. v. Ironworkers Local 86 found Seattle’s
    building trade union hiring practices and apprenticeship programs in
    violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&nbsp; Lindberg further
    ordered the imposition of a broad affirmative action program on the
    construction industry to be implemented through a board representing all the
    parties in the dispute, called the Court Order Advisory Committee (COAC).&nbsp;
    Lindberg’s decision was, according to employment law professor William
    Gould, “the earliest, and at the time of its issuance, the most
    comprehensive Title VII decree rendered in any court.”&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">But
    a vote by COAC members to keep Scott and the UCWA from overseeing the day to
    day hiring of black workers mandated by the court order caused immediate
    rancor, with Scott accusing COAC of allowing union hiring halls to undermine
    the affirmative action program from the inside.&nbsp; When institutional
    confusion, foot dragging, divisive behind the scenes lobbying, and on the
    job conflict between white and black workers prevented unions from meeting
    their court-ordered quotas for minority hiring, UCWA members took to the
    streets in the summer of 1972 and led dramatic protests that closed down
    I-90, Seattle Central Community College, and construction sites around the
    area.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">In
    response, on July 13<sup>th</sup>, 1972, Judge Lindberg made the UCWA party
    to U.S. v Ironworkers Local 86, gave it two representative positions on COAC,
    and gave it significant power over union apprenticeship programs.&nbsp;
    Scott served on COAC until it disbanded in 1978.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">From
    this new position of power, Scott and the UCWA had the unusual power—compared
    to other affirmative action programs—to act as implementer, watchdog, and
    enforcer of a federal court order to desegregate one of Seattle’s most
    powerful collection of labor unions.&nbsp; This gave the black workers of
    the UCWA a voice and leadership role in Seattle’s civil rights struggles
    that they augmented through alliances with the U.S. Equal Employment
    Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Washington State Manpower and Planning
    Council, the Seattle Urban League, and other government and non-governmental
    institutions.</font><font size="2"> </font>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">
    <a name="expands"></a>UCWA EXPANDS ITS REACH, 1973-5</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The UCWA expanded its
    organizing in 1971 to try to mobilize black workers in Denver to combat
    racial discrimination in the building trades there.&nbsp; Following its
    legal victories in 1972, Tyree Scott and the UCWA grew even more in their
    efforts to create solidarity networks in other cities, other industries, and
    other communities of color.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The UCWA’s end of year
    1972 report, “A Proposal to Combat Employment Discrimination in the State
    of Washington,” made this shift clear with its emphasis on developing
    organizing strategies in Washington that could then be exported to other
    cities throughout the region.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">In
    1973, the UCWA founded a branch in Oakland, California.&nbsp; And with a
    federal grant from the EEOC, it continued its work in Denver as well as
    created the Southwest Workers Federation, whose headquarters were in Little
    Rock, Arkansas.&nbsp; From there, Tyree Scott and fellow UCWA activist Todd
    Hawkins tried to organize minority construction workers, with mixed results,
    in eight cities: Little Rock and Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Monroe and
    Shreveport, Louisiana; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Austin, Tyler,
    and Waco, Texas.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    <span style="color: black">In Seattle, the UCWA also provided the training,
    the seed money, and the organizing model for the Alaska Cannery Workers
    Association (ACWA).&nbsp; The ACWA was founded in 1973 by radical Filipino
    youth who had been involved in solidarity work with the UCWA.&nbsp; </span>The
    ACWA fought racial segregation and inequality in Alaska cannery worker
    facilities through Title VII lawsuits and challenges to union elites that
    the young Filipino activists claimed were complicit in creating Filipino
    cannery workers’ poor working conditions.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;Also in 1973, the
    UCWA, ACWA, and Northwest Chapter of United Farm Workers (UFW) joined forces
    to found the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office (LELO).&nbsp; LELO
    pooled together legal resources and support for activist pro bono lawyers
    who had been pursuing Title VII lawsuits to aid these grassroots labor
    movements among workers of color.&nbsp; One of LELO’s lawsuits on behalf
    of the ACWA, Antonio v Ward’s Cove, went to the U.S. Supreme Court in
    1989.</font><font size="2"> </font>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">
    <a name="marxism"></a>UCWA AND THIRD WORLD MARXISM, 1975-1980</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tyree Scott was influenced
    by and became a lead participator in Seattle’s vibrant Third World Marxism
    community in the early to mid 1970s.&nbsp; Third World Marxism varied in its
    specific ideologies, but was generally most influential in the way that its
    thinkers used the term “Third World” to unify very different peoples
    around the world into a singular movement for racial and economic
    justice.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;Rather than
    organizing only African American workers, fighting a class struggle without
    attention to issues of race, or working to reform American society in
    exclusion from other countries, Scott increasingly came to see his and the
    UCWA’s activism as part of a global, grassroots, movement of “Third
    World” peoples against racism and imperialism.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;From 1973 to 1980,
    Scott and a number of other UCWA leaders helped coordinate the Seattle
    Workers Group, which later became associated with the Organizing Committee
    for an Ideological Center (OCIC).&nbsp; OCIC facilitated the interaction of
    20 Marxist worker organizations around the country from its founding in 1978
    to its demise in 1981.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;Scott was also a
    founding member of the Third World Coalition, a national racial justice
    organization begun by various American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)
    staff who were influenced by Third World Marxist ideas in 1971.&nbsp; From
    1977-79, Scott served as the national organization’s co-chair.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
    UCWA’s direction during this time reflected Scott and others’
    ideological shift.&nbsp; From 1975 to 1978, it produced a publication “for
    the Third World Poor” called <i>No Separate Peace</i>.&nbsp; Archived in
    its entirety on this web site,<a href="NSP.htm"> <i>No Separate Peace</i></a> 
    was an important part of the Seattle left press in the late 1970s, and
    sought to link Seattle’s local political issues to broader critiques of
    racism, sexism, and imperialism.</font><font size="2"> </font>

    <font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="color: black">POSTSCRIPT</span></font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    <span style="color: black">UCWA activists gradually shifted their energies
    to NW LELO in the late 1970s and early 1980s, allowing the UCWA to fade away
    sometime around 1980.&nbsp; A number of factors contributed to this shift:
    the transformation of COAC into the </span>
    Vocational Exploration and Referral Service Center in December, 1978; the
    end of <i>No Separate Peace</i>  in 1978; and the curtailment of federal
    funds for UCWA organizers around 1979.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">During
    this same time, LELO began to change its mission away from being merely a
    legal support agency. A growing backlash by federal judges throughout the
    1980s against Title VII lawsuits made it increasingly difficult for
    plaintiffs to prove racial discrimination using statistics about minority
    employment.&nbsp; With this shift, LELO’s focus opened up to include
    worker solidarity organizing that seemed to carry on the spirit of UCWA
    struggles under a different name.&nbsp; For more information about LELO,

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Before
    passing away on June 19, 2003, Scott donated his personal and organizational
    papers to the University of Washington Archives, the contents of which are
    almost entirely open to the public.&nbsp; For more information about the
