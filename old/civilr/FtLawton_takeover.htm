	morning of March 8, 1970, two half-mile long columns of vehicles began 
	forming in a south Seattle neighborhood. The vehicles moved north towards 
	Seattle’s Magnolia neighborhood and the recently decommissioned Fort Lawton 
	Army installation.&nbsp; As the convoys headed north onlookers could see the red 
	cloth banners streaming from the antennas of the automobiles. When the 
	caravans reached their destinations, both the north and south sides of Fort 
	Lawton, the occupants of the cars launched a coordinated effort to occupy 
	the fort and establish it as a cultural and social services center for 
	Seattle’s growing Native American population. In the midst of the ensuing 
	struggle, the occupation’s principal organizer Bernie Whitebear stated, “We, 
	the Native Americans, reclaim the land known as Fort Lawton in the name of 
	all American Indians by right of discovery.”<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a></span></p>

font-family:Arial">The Native activists who invaded Fort Lawton that day were 
	ultimately successful in their goal of establishing an urban Indian cultural 
	center at the site. While similar centers already existed in San Francisco, 
	Minneapolis, and New York, what was to become Daybreak Star Center was the 
	first to be established through militant protest. This paper tells the story 
	of the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation’s (UIATF) unique success in 
	its battle for Daybreak Star and, in a larger sense, for what Bernie 
	Whitebear later described as “self-determination.”<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

	Urban Indians and the Impetus for Invasion</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fort Lawton invasion was a response to the declining state 
	of Native reservations and to the challenges faced by Seattle’s growing 
	urban Indian population, as well as the government’s apparent lack of 
	concern for either. In this sense, the invasion was years in the making. 
	During the 1950s the federal government began what it termed the policies of 
	Relocation and Termination in order to deal with the “Indian Problem.” This 
	meant that in an attempt to “liquidate all tribal assets, the federal 
	government set up relocation programs moving thousands of Indians into 
	cities with promises of better employment and educational opportunities.”<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a> 
	It was no coincidence that the reservations identified for termination were 
	also those with the most wealth and natural resources. According to Fort 
	Lawton occupier and current UIATF board member Randy Lewis, the result was 
	that “overnight the richest reservations in the country became some of the 
	poorest counties in the country.”<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Indian Health 
	Service developed a concurrent Relocation policy that worked in tandem with 
	the policy of Termination to deprive Natives of government services. Many 
	Natives found that living in the stagnant economy of the reservation had 
	become impossible without the financial aid of the federal government and so 
	moved to cities in order to gain access to burgeoning urban economies. 
	Seattle’s Native population rose from 700 in 1950 to more than 4,000 in 
	1970.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
	Under its Relocation policy, the federal government encouraged Natives to 
	migrate to cities and then ensured that once Indians left the reservation, 
	or the reservation was terminated, they were no longer under the 
	jurisdiction of the Tribal Governments or under the administrative authority 
	of the BIA. In effect, Relocation nullified the federal government’s 
	longstanding treaty obligations and further decreased its commitment to 
	Native populations. In doing so it dramatically reduced the amount of aid 
	the federal government was responsible for administering. Thus the 
	government could wash its hands of Native reliance on federal programs and 
	funding.</span></p>

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Natives in Seattle, there were few places to 
	turn for help in an often new and unfamiliar urban setting.&nbsp; As there were 
	no federal, state, county, or city funds available, Natives had to rely on 
	volunteer social services. Most of these were provided by the American 
	Indian Women’s Service League, which operated out of an old church downtown.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a> 
	A free health care clinic also operated three nights a week in space donated 
	by the Marine Public Health Hospital. Volunteer doctors and nurses staffed 
	the clinic, utilizing donated pharmaceuticals stored in a lady’s restroom.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the late sixties, the city of Seattle was at least marginally 
	aware of the need to address the problems of urban Indians. In 1969, the 
	city assigned Blair Paul, a young University of Washington Law School 
	graduate who was working as a Seattle Human Rights Department officer, to 
	address the problem. Paul, who would become a founding member of the UIATF 
	board of trustees, recalls that the city and the Human Rights Department 
	hired him in an attempt to become more relevant within the widening context 
	of the Civil Rights Movement: “It was clear that other than blacks, by the 
	late sixties early seventies [the Civil Rights Movement] had really touched 
	very few other minority groups.”<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
	War on Poverty programs meant that millions of dollars were coming into 
	Seattle for minorities, but Indians were receiving none of these funds. 
	Neither the Service League nor Kinatechitapi, a Native American employment 
	assistance collective formed in 1969, were successful in securing any 
	federal funds. As one observer stated, the city “passed the buck” while 
	“millions of dollars poured into the Central District.”<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul felt that in order for Natives to be successful in the 
	competition for public assistance funds floating around at the time they 
	needed to organize. “Natives were not well organized,” he recalls. “They 
	weren’t organized at all. I was hired by the Department to focus on the 
	needs of urban Indians in Seattle. The first thing I did was to organize a 
	meeting at Kinatechitapi. There were as many as sixty different Indian 
	groups that showed up.”<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> 
	The meeting, held in September 1969, proved to be a success because it 
	provided a forum for the emergence of new leadership. &nbsp;.&nbsp; According to Paul, 
	&nbsp;that is where Bernie Whitebear began to show his abilities. “And the next 
	two years with Bernie, it was full tilt to the wall. An amazing, amazing 
	human being. I can’t speak highly enough of him.”<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born Bernie Reyes in the small Eastern Washington town of 
	Inchelium on September 27, 1937, <span style="color:black">Whitebear </span>
	became aware of the problems facing urban Indians through first hand 
	experience. <span style="color:black">He was by birth a member of the 
	Colville Confederated Tribe, an amalgamation of eleven different Plateau 
	bands – Colville, San Poil, Nespelem, Lakes, Southern Okanogan, Entiat, 
	Methow, Columbia, Wenatchi, Palus, and Nez Perce – created in 1872 under 
	executive order of President Grant. He was also half Filipino, an ethnic mix 
	common enough that the term &quot;Indipino&quot; has entered the parlance of our time.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a> 
	Whitebear</span> often had difficulty finding work and was aware of the 
	racism that Indians faced in American cities. As a young man living in 
	Tacoma, he fished the Puyallup River with his friend, Puyallup Native Bob 
	Saticum. Both men were having trouble finding work and fishing was the one 
	source of livelihood that racist hiring practices could not restrict Indians 
	from engaging in.<span style="color:black"> </span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:black">In 1959 Whitebear began meeting regularly with 
	other Natives in Tacoma, usually at Indian taverns, to discuss the problems 
	they faced and possible solutions. The core group, consisting of Whitebear 
	and Saticum, George Meachem, Robert Taylor, and Gary Kalapis, began 
	referring to themselves as the “Skins.” According to Whitebear’s brother and 
	biographer Lawney Reyes, “They spent most of their time drinking, talking, 
	and trying to solve all the world’s needs. But Bernie knew that this was 
	only a shallow exercise. He listened and became aware of the many problems 
	Natives faced each day but felt it was time to move on with his life, to 
	somehow help relieve the problems of his people instead of just talking 
	about them.”<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
	1961 Whitebear moved to Seattle where he began organizing events to make 
	Native concerns more visible to the White population and also creating 
	cultural activities to help affirm traditional Native identity among urban 
	Indians. He was </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">aware of the political climate of Seattle during the mid to late sixties 
	and saw it as an opportunity to press Native grievances. “Seattle had the 
	Students of Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, United Black 
	Contractors, Vietnam War and United Farm Workers protestors,” he wrote.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Whitebear was not alone in thinking it was time for Native people to be more 
	militant. At Western Washington University, Randy Lewis, also a Colville, 
	was helping to establish the American Indian Student Union. The hosted a 
	conference, The Right to be Indian Conference, “that drew together a lot of 
	people from throughout the nation,” Lewis recalls.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">On November 20, dozens of young Native American activists 
	headed through San Francisco’s early morning fog toward the abandoned 
	Alcatraz penitentiary and forever changed the way Native Americans would 
	fight for their rights. Among them were a number of Northwest Natives, 
	including Bernie Whitebear and Randy Lewis. The activists who occupied 
	Alcatraz were for the most part young urban Indians who were either college 
	students or recent college graduates. Their strategy was militant, 
	confrontational, direct-action, non-violent protest. This was new in the 
	Indian community and contrasted with the strategy of older tribal government 
	officials, often referred to as “Uncle Tomahawks” by the new radical Indian 
	youth, who advocated a gradualist approach and held their leadership 
	positions through a perceived cozying up to non-Indian officials. The youth 
	felt that they were being misrepresented by traditional leaders, and for the 
	first time utilized their voices and stood in numbers behind such spokesmen 
	as Clyde Warrior, who in testimony before the President’s Advisory 
	Commission on Rural Poverty in 1967 illustrated the dissatisfaction of 
	Indian youth: “We are not free. We do not make choices. Our choices are made 
	for us; we are the poor. For those of us who live on reservations these 
	choices and decisions are made by federal administrators, bureaucrats, and 
	their ‘yes men,’ euphemistically called tribal governments.”<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The Alcatraz occupation lasted nearly eighteen months and was 
	ultimately joined by over five thousand protesters. The young activists 
	succeeded in capturing the attention of the national media and spotlighting 
	the plight of urban Indians. Their ultimate goal was to establish a Native 
	American university and cultural center on Alcatraz Island. Although 
	unsuccessful in this regard, their methods influenced and inspired 
	discontented and frustrated urban Indians around the country, including 
	Seattle.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Whitebear returned from Alcatraz with an even stronger 
	awareness of the need for a new, more radical approach in Seattle. This 
	awareness was catalyzed in 1970 when Richard Nixon signed a bill into law, 
	introduced by Washington Senators Henry Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson, 
	which enabled non-federal entities to obtain surplus federal lands for 0-50 
	percent of fair market value.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> 
	Under the new law, the city of Seattle was eligible to acquire Fort Lawton 
	at little to no cost. The Service League and Kinatechitapi repeatedly 
	petitioned to have a portion of the fort set aside to accommodate a Native 
	cultural center.&nbsp; But the city denied their requests and suggested that they 
	appeal to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Of course, the city knew that under 
	the policy of Relocation and Termination this would be pointless because the 
	BIA had no authority over urban Indians. To Whitebear and his cohorts, the 
	city’s actions displayed a complete lack of regard for its Native 
	population.<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a> 
	Coming as it did on the heels of the Alcatraz occupation, Whitebear saw the 
	new law as an opportunity for political action. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">In<span style="color:black"> March of 1970, Whitebear was the 
	leader of a growing number of younger urban Indians who were tired of the 
	misrepresentation of the American Indian in Seattle politics and frustrated 
	by the city’s unwillingness to negotiate. Inspired by the success of the 
	Black Power movement and by the birth of Red Power and the recent occupation 
	of Alcatraz, and free from the older, more conservative Native leadership, 
	Whitebear organized for an assault on Fort Lawton</span>.&quot; We felt he (Sen. 
	Jackson) had channeled us into oblivion,” said Whitebear.&nbsp; “And that touched 
	off the demonstrations at Fort Lawton.”<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Whitebear and the others felt the time was right to follow 
	the path of those who acted on Alcatraz and attempt to physically occupy 
	Fort Lawton. They sent out a national call for help.&nbsp;  
	As he later wrote, the “‘Moccasin Telegraph’ worked surprisingly well and 
	within days numbers of supporters began arriving in Seattle.”<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
	Among those pledging assistance were National Indian Youth Council members Clyde 
	Warrior, Vine Deloria, Shirley Whithill, and fellow Colville Randy Lewis. 
	When it became clear that members from the Indians of All Tribes on Alcatraz 
	would be willing to help in the occupation of Fort Lawton, as would similar 
	groups from Canada led by George Abbot, the decision to act 
	was sealed.<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Whitebear didn’t see the breaching of the Fort’s defenses and 
	gaining access to the area as much of an obstacle as he had spent plenty of 
	time training on the grounds as both a paratrooper and as a special forces 
	soldier, as did a Garry Brey another member of the invading group.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	The most challenging portion to him would be organizing all of the potential 
	occupants that had no training.&nbsp; The night before the invasion, drawing on 
	the connections of his heritage, Whitebear organized a powwow at the 
	Filipino Community hall in south Seattle, both to celebrate the coming 
	operations and to communicate to as many people as possible the plans for 
	the invasion.<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a> 
	At the powwow Whitebear addressed the potential participants with the 
	message that, “it may get rough.&nbsp; I want you all to hold you temper, in 
	spite of the difficulty and pain you might face.&nbsp; If any of you need alcohol 
	or drugs to get you through this, forget it.&nbsp; I don’t want to make the same 
	mistakes that were made at Alcatraz.&nbsp; I want to win this one.”

	following morning, March 8, 1970, more than 100 participants mustered into 
	two half-mile long convoys and began the drive to opposite ends of the Fort.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	As the caravans drove towards the north and south ends of the Fort the

	protesters scaled the fences on both the north and south ends of Fort 
	Lawton, draping blankets over the razor wire as they climbed over. They 
	quickly set up tepees and drum circles and began singing traditional Native 
	songs. A Reserve Military Police (MP) company completing its weekend 
	drilling was surprised by the invasion and, in turn, surprised the invaders. 
	“We didn’t realize there were still soldiers on the base,” Randy Lewis said 
	later. The MPs requested help from Fort Lewis and armed troops soon arrived 
	alongside squads of Seattle police officers. With bolstered numbers they 
	descended on the occupiers and began marching or carrying them away through 
	a blackberry patch toward awaiting trucks. This was done not out of malice 
	said one soldier, but because “the Army always does everything the hard 
	way.”<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>

	out,” Reyes writes. “The leaders Bernie had selected had to intervene more 
	than once to maintain order. The Indians that were caught were put in the 
	stockade.”<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[30]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">While the occupiers were removed from inside the fort, the 
	protest continued outside the gates. Indeed, the demonstrators who gathered 
	en masse to continue the fight were a critical component of the invasion’s 
	success. As Reyes recalls, “Outside the main gate of Fort Lawton, five 
	hundred Indians and non-Indian allies assembled to show their support to the 
	invading activists. The Media was there with their cameras.”<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[31]</span></span></a> 
	There is considerable debate over the actual numbers of protesters outside 
	the gates. Some estimates claim hundreds of participants while others 
	remember the numbers ranging from fifty to ninety. Those who were outside 
	carried lighthearted signs with messages such as “Custer Wore Arrow Shirts” 
	and “Kill Our Women, Rape Our Buffalo.”<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[32]</span></span></a> 
	The protesters remained outside of the front gates for three weeks, thanks 
	in part to the support they received from community members who supplied the 
	vigil, which became known as “Resurrection City,” with food and clothing. 
	Hewlett’s Catering, owners of Tillicum Village, provided a catered meal each 
	day.<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[33]</span></span></a> 
	These protesters caused the Army such consternation that two active duty 
	companies were sent to Fort Lawton from Fort Lewis to install nearly one 
	mile of concertina wire around the entrance to prevent any further 
	invasions.<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[34]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Despite the army’s new security measures, Indian leaders were 
	anxious to maintain their momentum and the interest of the press, as well as 
	to perhaps exorcise grudges over the rough treatment the protesters had 
	received on March 8. “The beatings we took were not going to be forgotten,” 
	said Lewis about the first invasion.<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[35]</span></span></a> 
	Consequently, a second invasion was planned to take place four days later. 
	The group found that the only viable access to the fort was from the least 
	likely of approaches, the water. On March 12, complete with teepees, drums, 
	elderly persons, and children, the group infiltrated the south end of the 
	fort. They scaled the large bluffs abutting the fort by clinging to the root 
	systems of the trees that grew out of the cliffs. They also shrewdly timed 
	the foot patrols of the guards and were able to set up their teepees, build 
	a fire, and begin a drum circle in between the rotation of the sentries. 
	Randy Lewis remembers the reaction of the guard upon discovering the 
	invasion: “The next time he comes by he goes, what the hell! There are a 
	hundred Indians over there drumming and singing. What happened?”<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[36]</span></span></a> 
	The MPs soon descended once again, coming in force and in full riot gear. 
	Before they could see the MPs the occupiers heard the thumping of their 
	black jacks as they advanced in unison. Lewis recounts climbing a ridge to 
	get a better look. “I was with Douglas Remington, who was a Ute Indian from 
	Utah of all places … We climbed this ridge and as far as the eye could see 
	there were MPs marching. They crested the hill and we all figured this is 
	it. It’s going to be Wounded Knee all over again.”<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></span></a> 
	This time the occupiers chose not fight back, but rather fell limp to the 
	ground in nonviolent resistance. “We didn’t want to risk the old people or 
	the Children,” Lewis said. Still, they did not go easily. Lewis remembers 
	Grace Thorpe, the daughter of famed athlete Jim Thorpe saying, “‘I stand 
	over six feet tall and it’s going to take eight of you to move me.’ And it 
	did.”<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[38]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Eventually, the occupants were rounded up and once again taken to Fort 
	Lawton’s stockade.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">While the city’s general population seemed to be behind the 
	Native group after the occupation, there was considerable dissent from 
	within the Native community. After meeting with Army officials, Whitebear 
	and his group felt compelled to defend their actions to the Native elements 
	of the community who thought they were inappropriate and counterproductive. 
	During a meeting held at the Alaska Native Services building the invaders 
	were faced with strong opposition. Much of it stemmed from the American 
	Indian Women’s Service League and especially its founder, Pearl Warren, who 
	felt that militant action would jeopardize the modest funding the city was 
	already granting to Natives.<a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[39]</span></span></a>Although 
	he himself was a militant activist, Randy Lewis regrets the divisions caused 
	by the invasion. “The old guard in the Service League in many ways felt they 
	were being ignored, resented, and even displaced. If I could do one thing 
	different I would honor those women for what they had done previously, and 
	apologize to them for the ill will that was brought on to them because that 
	was a lot of pain.” Thus, in Lewis’s words, the invasion “both galvanized 
	and factionalized our community.”<a name="_ednref40" title href="#_edn40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[40]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Resurrection City remained 
	outside of the front gates of the fort for over three weeks, complete with 
	functional teepees and continuous demonstrations to block and complicate the 
	mission of the Army personnel attempting to operate in the area. By the end 
	of March, Indian leaders faced a decision. According to Lewis, “We had to 
	decide if we were going to stay or go, so we met again at the Filipino 
	Community Center and decided to call it quits on April 1st. We decided to 
	take down Resurrection City the next day. Frank White Buffaloman, an old 
	Sioux medicine man that lived in the area told the press that there would be 
	a message from the sky that day.&nbsp; Everybody poo pooed him of course and 
	Frank was out there when we were holding our press conference and from up in 
	the sky … Frank had hired a sky writer and it says, ‘Surrender Ft. Lawton.’”<a name="_ednref41" title href="#_edn41"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[41]</span></span></a> 
	As the teepees were being taken down about fifty Indians, accompanied by 
	television crews and cameras, rushed past the guards for a third and final 
	occupation on April 2, 1970.<a name="_ednref42" title href="#_edn42"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[42]</span></span></a> 
	The Natives scattered throughout the base while MPs began making immediate 
	arrests. When <i>Seattle Times</i> reporter Don Hannula reached Bernie 
	Whitebear for comment, Whitebear said that the third occupation was “an 
	effort to reaffirm Indian demands that surplus designated Fort Lawton land 
	be turned over for a multipurpose and education center.”<a name="_ednref43" title href="#_edn43"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[43]</span></span></a> 
	As Resurrection City came down and the trespassing Natives spent their last 
	night in Fort Lawton’s stockade, Whitebear announced the transition from 
	occupation to negotiation.<a name="_ednref44" title href="#_edn44"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[44]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
	<h2 style="line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Phase Two: Negotiation</span></h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most immediate success of the occupation of Fort Lawton was 
	the effect it had on public opinion. As Whitebear wrote, “the invasions and 
	occupations had achieved one major objective, gaining commitments of support 
	from the local residents of Seattle.”<a name="_ednref45" title href="#_edn45"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[45]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Perhaps even more important than local support was the support of 
	actress/activist Jane Fonda, whose impact on public opinion, not only 
	locally but nationally and even internationally, cannot be understated. 
	Fonda, perhaps more than anyone else, got Bernie Whitebear through the door 
	and brought the politicians to the bargaining table.<a name="_ednref46" title href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[46]</span></span></a> 
	“She broadcast that face and that Barbarella body,” said Lewis of Fonda’s 
	involvement. While she did little at the actual occupation her leverage and 
	media presence granted Whitebear and others the foothold they needed to 
	begin the bargaining process for the land they desired. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Whitebear was advised by attorneys Garry Bass and Blair Paul 
	to form an organization that could be seen as representative of the Natives 
	in Seattle during the negotiations to come. The new organization was named 
	the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation and was sponsored by the 
	National Congress of American Indians, the largest Indian organization in 
	the United States at the time, in addition to more than forty non-Indian 
	organizations throughout King County.<a name="_ednref47" title href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[47]</span></span></a> 
	This level of public support enabled a UIATF committee to gain an audience 
	with BIA commissioner Louis Bruce. The committee,&nbsp; consisting of Whitebear, 
	Randy Lewis, Dr. Frances Svensson and others, successfully convinced Bruce 
	to place a hold on Fort Lawton lands, thereby preserving their status as 
	“surplus” federal land, until further negotiations could be completed. Bruce 
	was later pressured politically by the Department of the Interior to remove 
	the hold because it represented a breach of the BIA’s policy of refusing to 
	deal with urban Indians.<a name="_ednref48" title href="#_edn48"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[48]</span></span></a> 
	In the meantime, the hold meant that the city could not acquire the land.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The temporary hold enabled the UIATF to make an application 
	for part of the property prior to the city of Seattle’s application through 
	the Department of the Interior. This early application put the UIATF on 
	equal ground with the city of Seattle in the eyes of the General Services 
	Administration, which was responsible for final disposal of federal surplus 
	property. The early application reportedly enraged Mayor Uhlman, who had 
	been lobbying for the property for years. Whitebear responded by stating 
	that he could “understand how they felt after 10 years of work to get the 
	property for the city, but I remember that we’ve had 300 years of 
	injustice.”<a name="_ednref49" title href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[49]</span></span></a> 
	The move, in conjunction with pressure from Senator Jackson, forced Uhlman 
	to negotiate with the UIATF. Senator Jackson was at the time a candidate for 
	the Democratic presidential nomination. As one negotiator pointed out to the
	<i>Seattle Post Intelligencer</i>, “Jackson turned on the Heat. He needed to 
	improve his image with Indians, and the last thing in the world he wanted 
	was to have a bunch of them here and elsewhere on the warpath.”<a name="_ednref50" title href="#_edn50"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[50]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Negotiations started in June of 1971 and were not completed 
	until November when it was agreed that the UIATF would lease twenty acres 
	for a 99-year period with options for successive 99-year leases without 
	renegotiation. The agreement was approved, executed and incorporated on 
	March 29, 1972 and the surplus land was transferred on August 30.<a name="_ednref51" title href="#_edn51"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[51]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
	Bernie Whitebear was sure to refer to the agreement as anything but a 
	treaty: “it’s not a treaty. The white man doesn’t keep treaties. It’s a 
	legal, binding, agreement.”<a name="_ednref52" title href="#_edn52"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[52]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">With the agreement reached, the next task was to develop the 
	program for the cultural center, to design the buildings, and to seek funds 
	for their construction. In March of 1973 the city of Seattle designated 
	$500,000 of its general revenue sharing funds for the development of the 
	cultural center. An additional grant of $250,000 was awarded from the 
	Economic Development Administration (EDA). Both the city and the EDA later 
	contributed more funds to the project in addition to the timber the UIATF 
	received form the Colville, Quinault, and Makah Tribes. In the end, the 
	total construction cost reached&nbsp; $1.2 million.<a name="_ednref53" title href="#_edn53"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[53]</span></span></a> 
	With the funding for the center secured, the groundbreaking occurred on 
	September 27, 1975. Eighteen months later, on May 13, 1977, the building, 
	which Lawney Reyes helped design, was dedicated. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invasion of Fort Lawton was not a total victory. The 
	activists had hoped to secure all ten thousand acres of surplus land and in 
	the end received only forty.<a name="_ednref54" title href="#_edn54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[54]</span></span></a> 
	And the militant nature of the protest caused dissension within Seattle’s 
	Indian community along generational lines. Yet in other important respects 
	the invasion was a momentous success. Alongside the Alcatraz takeover, it 
	signaled to the city of Seattle and the nation that urban Indians would 
	fight for rights, redress, and respect by any means necessary. In this way, 
	it is inseparable from other radical movements for social justice and civil 
	rights involving persons of color, women, and the working-class that have 
	defined the period between the late 1960s and mid 1970s. The invasion also 
	resulted in the formation of the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, a 
	crucial institutional body that continues to unify the Native community 
	across diverse tribal affiliations. Equally important, the Daybreak Star 
	Center filled, and continues to fill, a vital place in Seattle’s Native 
	community as both a provider of essential social services and a preserver of 
	Native history and culture. The UIATF named the center Daybreak Star after a 
	vision by Black Elk, a Sioux medicine man. According to the center’s 
	official history, Black Elk’s vision foretold of “a ‘daybreak star herb,’ 
	the herb of ‘understanding,’ falling to the ground and blossoming forth on 
	one stem in four directions … a black, a white, a scarlet and a yellow.&nbsp; The 
	four colors symbolize the four races of mankind united in four directions … 
	spiritually, physically, mentally and emotionally. On March 8, 1970, the 
	herb fell to the ground.”<a name="_ednref55" title href="#_edn55"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[55]</span></span></a></span></p>
