		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The phone suddenly 
		rang in the middle of the night at the home of a reporter for the <i>
		Helix</i>, a Seattle alternative newspaper, on March 15, 1970.&nbsp; The call 
		was from an organizer from a Seattle Indian activist group known as the 
		United Indians of All Tribes (UIAT), who instructed the <i>Helix </i>
		reporter to come immediately to a secret meeting place.<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a> 
		&nbsp;Upon their arrival, the reporter and other news staff found nearly a 
		hundred American Indians from all walks of life assembled at a Seattle 
		home.&nbsp; The reporters were about to witness the second “occupation” of 
		Fort Lawton, part of a series of UIAT demonstrations to reclaim the 
		soon-to-be surplus military grounds for use as a cultural and social 
		service center for American Indians.&nbsp; They followed along as the group 
		snuck along private beachfront properties and over to a hill leading up 
		to the fort.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 6:30 a.m., the Indians quickly moved onto the Fort 
		grounds, and built a small teepee and a fire to warm them.&nbsp; “Full of 
		high spirits, the Indians dance and chant to celebrate their victory,”
		<i>Helix </i>reported.&nbsp; However, around 7:15 a.m., they were discovered 
		by a patrol and soon, 50 military police arrived and demanded their 
		surrender.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Helix</i> 
		reporter observed that despite the Indians’ “defeat” at the fort, 
		“People are becoming more aware of the validity of the Indians’ claim 
		for recognition.”&nbsp; In fact, this three-week series of demonstrations by 
		the UIAT, with Colville Bernie Whitebear and Puyallup Bob Satiacum as 
		their leaders and spokesmen, created a media buzz in the local, 
		national, and international press.&nbsp; The media coverage of this new, 
		militant, intertribal Indian movement not only informed the public about 
		the fort land takeover, but also the struggles and challenges faced&nbsp; by 
		urban Indians, such as poverty, disease, poor education, and lack of job 
		opportunities.&nbsp; The extensive press coverage helped give the UIAT the 
		publicity, public support, and leverage they needed to negotiate with 
		the city to reclaim Fort Lawton for what would become the Daybreak Star 
		Cultural Center. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This essay will 
		examine the press coverage of the UIAT demonstrations at Fort Lawton, 
		controversies surrounding the events, and how American Indian activists 
		used the expanding press attention and public sympathy to increase 
		public consciousness of their needs.&nbsp; Local mainstream newspapers such 
		as the <i>Seattle Times</i> and the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> 
		provided expansive, in-depth coverage, which was highly informative but 
		sometimes unsympathetic, and often contained language that reinforced 
		stereotypes.&nbsp; College and alternative newspapers such as the <i>Helix
		</i>and the <i>University of Washington Daily</i> were supportive of the 
		UIAT and encouraged Seattle residents to get involved.&nbsp; The American 
		Indian press, which was rapidly growing at the time, was split over the 
		issue; some American Indians chose not be associated with the militant 
		tactics of the new Red Power movement.&nbsp; These differences were 
		important, but the sheer volume of press attention was the most 
		significant development.&nbsp; This explosion of media coverage of American 
		Indians was part of a change of journalistic style and treatment of 
		American Indians of the press.&nbsp; &nbsp;American Indian activists were making 
		headlines, voicing their concerns and opinions through the press, and 
		reaching a broad, mainstream audience in the United States and around 
		the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although there were 
		over 4,000 American Indian residents in Seattle in 1970, they remained 
		an “invisible” part of the population.&nbsp; Seattle Indians were 
		geographically dispersed throughout the city, unlike Asian and African 
		Americans whose populations were concentrated in the International and 
		Central Districts, respectively. Federal government agencies such as the 
		Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Indian Health Services (IHS) only 
		recognized American Indians who lived on reservations, and did not 
		direct any resources to help urban Indians.<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> 
		&nbsp;Many Seattle Indians felt that federal programs and funding were 
		disproportionately going to the African-Americans in the Central 
		District.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The American Indian 
		Women's Service League, established in 1958, was the first American 
		Indian-run organization in Seattle dedicated to providing social 
		services to urban Indians.&nbsp; Although the AIWSL did manage to help 
		thousands of local Indians navigate their way through the challenges of 
		their urban surroundings, their Seattle Indian Center operated out of a 
		small, rented space, and relied upon private donations.&nbsp; Seattle Indians 
		lobbied and voiced their concerns to the local and federal governments, 
		but the government and the BIA continued to drag their feet on the 
		issues.&nbsp; For example, Bernie Whitebear had previously proposed a new 
		Indian Center on the Fort Lawton grounds.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		He believed the government had not taken his request seriously.<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">By the late 1960s, 
		many American Indians had grown weary of the government’s lack of 
		response to their petitions, lobbying, lawsuits, and other attempts to 
		work within the system.&nbsp; Inspired by the success of the more militant 
		Black Power movement, American Indians began to take direct action.&nbsp; In 
		1969, American Indian activists in California occupied Alcatraz Island, 
		formerly a federal prison, reclaiming it for their own and demanding a 
		cultural facility on the rock.&nbsp; While they were unsuccessful in gaining 
		permanent ownership of the island, the demonstration attracted a 
		whirlwind of international media attention, and inspired other “Red 
		Power” activists in other parts of the country.<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
		&nbsp;With the struggles and challenges facing American Indians publicized in 
		the media, as well as a general increase in social consciousness of the 
		time, public sentiment was turning in favor of American Indians, who 
		could now use this as a strategy to advance their agenda.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On March 8, 1970, a 
		week before the <i>Helix</i> reporter accompanied the demonstration, 
		Colville Bernie Whitebear and dozens of other American Indian activists 
		and their families, who came to be known as the United Indians of All 
		Tribes, entered and peacefully occupied Fort Lawton. &nbsp;Their goal was to 
		reclaim the surplus land for the American Indians, which they believed 
		was legally and morally theirs.&nbsp; They wanted to build a permanent 
		cultural and social service center to help urban Indians become 
		self-sufficient and successful, and also celebrate their cultures and 
		traditions.&nbsp; Over the next several weeks, the UIAT led two more 
		occupations of the fort, an around-the-clock picket outside the fort 
		grounds, and demonstrations in front of the United States Courthouse to 
		protest the activists’ arrests and alleged military police brutality.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Immediately, the 
		local press was at the scene.&nbsp; The <i>Seattle Times</i> and the <i>
		Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>, the two largest mainstream Seattle 
		newspapers, covered the demonstration extensively.&nbsp; Both publications 
		gave regular updates throughout the next several weeks of the 
		demonstration, as well as developments in the UIAT’s subsequent 
		negotiations with the government for ownership of the surplus land.&nbsp; 
		They helped give American Indian activists a voice, a chance to tell the 
		public in their own words why they were there on the fort grounds.&nbsp; 
		However, each newspaper had a different “take” on the series of events.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On March 9, 1970, 
		the day after the first occupation of Fort Lawton, the front page of the
		<i>Seattle Times</i> detailed the experiences of actress Jane Fonda, who 
		attended the demonstration in support of the American Indians.<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Little mention was made of the UIAT, the demonstration, and its purpose 
		until page A11.&nbsp; The article mostly focused on specifics of accusations 
		of military police violence, and the United States Courthouse 
		demonstration the group was planning to protest the violence.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The<i> Seattle Times</i> briefly explained the Fort Lawton occupation as 
		being a result of leaders Bob Satiacum and Bernie Whitebear's 
		difficulties in obtaining the land through official channels to build 
		their new Indian center.&nbsp; “We don't have a chance in hell of getting 
		it,” Whitebear told the <i>Times.</i>&nbsp; The <i>Seattle Times</i> 
		consistently covered every new development during the three-week series 
		of demonstrations, raising public awareness of the events, but the 
		writers seemed indifferent to the underlying issues behind it, and the 
		needs of urban Indians.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, the <i>
		Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> picked up where the <i>Seattle Times</i> 
		fell short, and took an active interest in the UIAT's demonstrations and 
		its message. While the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer </i>did not profess 
		sympathy for the cause, the news coverage expressed a deeper concern for 
		and fascination with this new American Indian movement, and struggles 
		facing urban Indians.&nbsp; The takeover of Fort Lawton dominated the 
		headlines, pictures, and articles featured on the first two pages of the 
		March 9 issue.&nbsp; On March 12, a headline read, “Equality in Seattle Is 
		Indians’ Message.”&nbsp; &nbsp;The <i>Post-Intelligencer</i> acknowledged, “the 
		city of Seattle must bring all its citizens up to the same level if it 
		is to progress as a community.”&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Through the<i> 
		Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>, Bernie Whitebear informed the public 
		about challenges facing urban Indians, such as the 37% unemployment rate 
		among Seattle Indians, poor housing and living conditions, and 
		illiteracy.<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Whitebear and Satiacum presented their plans for the new Indian center 
		as a place that would not only address these problems by providing 
		social services and education, but would also celebrate traditional 
		American Indian cultures and educate the Seattle community.<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Satiacum said, &quot;For the school, we want to show how proud we are of our 
		own culture and heritage.&nbsp; We want to pass that along -- not to just our 
		own descendents, but to whites, too.”&nbsp; The leaders also planned to 
		restore most of the land to its natural state.&nbsp; “There would be berries, 
		trees, game… somewhere among the trees, we would build a true Indian 
		longhouse to be used as school and museum,” Satiacum told the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer.</i></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to the 
		mainstream Seattle press, the Fort Lawton demonstrations naturally 
		attracted the attention of the rapidly growing American Indian press. 
		The reaction from the American Indian press reflected a difference in 
		opinion between different Indian groups.&nbsp; The <i>Indian Center News</i>, 
		a monthly newsletter published by the American Indian Women's Service 
		League, gently supported the demonstration.&nbsp; The April 1970 issue 
		briefly covered the events of the three-week demonstration, reported the 
		names of the activists involved, and reprinted the entire text of a UIAT 
		“proclamation” reclaiming the land for the American Indians.<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The Service League was not a militant organization, and most of its 
		members chose to support the occupation from behind the scenes, rather 
		than on the front lines.&nbsp; The AIWSL was optimistic about the results of 
		the demonstration; they reported that “the nonviolent 
		invasion…accomplished the UIAT goal of bringing the plight of urban 
		Indians to the attention of officials and the public.”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i>
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Cherokee Examiner
		</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">editor N. 
		Littlefoot Magowan, however, was an excited and passionate participant 
		in the demonstration.&nbsp; The editor gave a detailed, in-depth personal 
		account of the events that transpired on April 2, 1970 in a special 
		report to the <i>Los Angeles Free Press</i>.<a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		After storming the gates with 30 to 40 other American Indians, Magowan 
		described “giving the soldiers a run for their money,” and exclaimed, “I 
		was the first member of my family in three generations to rip off an 
		army fort.&nbsp; Haya-hei-hai!”&nbsp; After being chased by a young MP, he was 
		finally arrested and participated in an attempted escape.&nbsp; Magowan ended 
		his piece by proclaiming, “This area, this Fort, is ours in all 
		ways…I'll be back at Fort Lawton, possibly before the story is even 
		printed.&nbsp; WE SHALL LIVE AGAIN!”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While some American 
		Indian publications and journalists gave their full support, others were 
		completely silent about Fort Lawton. <i>The Indian Voice</i>, published 
		by the Small Tribes Organization of Western Washington in Federal Way, 
		made no mention of the demonstration that occurred only a short 
		geographic distance away.&nbsp; It is unknown specifically why the paper 
		decided to ignore these events; however, according to the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer,</i> the<i> </i>Small Tribes Organization did not 
		endorse the Fort Lawton demonstrations.<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Perhaps they wanted to distance themselves from the untraditional, more 
		radical tactics embraced by activists of the UIAT.&nbsp; The <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer</i> cited the lack of endorsement as &quot;evidence that 
		the state's reservation Indians were not in total sympathy with the aims 
		and methods of their urban brothers.&quot;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As news of the Fort 
		Lawton occupation and urban Indian issues reached readers throughout the 
		city, the United Indians of All Tribes gained the support of local 
		student publications.&nbsp; The <i>University Of Washington Daily</i> 
		concentrated on the UIAT's perspective in the debate; reporter Francis 
		Svensson writes, &quot;because Indians have all too often been ‘invisible’ 
		for purposes of health, welfare, employment, and educational services in 
		Seattle… there has been a very real need to concentrate services and 
		facilities in a centralized multipurpose facility.&quot;<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> 
		The Seattle Community College publication<i> The City Collegian</i> 
		featured an article titled &quot;Ft. Lawton Indians Capture Summit,&quot; which 
		outlined the key points a group of American Indian guest speakers 
		presented to college students on behalf of the UIAT.<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		This article was followed by an editorial that encouraged Seattle 
		Community College to step forward and “meet with the United Indians of 
		All Tribes to smoke a peace pipe, and agree to meet with all others to 
		facilitate and aid the Indians in finding and establishing an Indian 
		University and Cultural Center.&quot;<a name="_ednref15" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Fort Lawton 
		occupation became a national sensation, bringing awareness of American 
		Indian issues to readers across the country. The <i>New York Times </i>
		reported on March 9, 1970 that the “Indians ‘attacked’ Fort Lawton at 
		its main gates, set up diversionary actions, scaled bluffs and fences 
		and managed to put up a teepee in the small clearing in some woods.”<a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		In a related article, <i>New York Times </i>writer James Naughton 
		acknowledged the American Indians' plight, bringing national attention 
		to the problems urban Indians were facing.<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		He explored a number of issues, such as poor education and healthcare, 
		and difficulties accessing welfare and other social services outside the 
		reservation.&nbsp; He wrote, &quot;they are smothered with federal paternalism 
		alternating with malignant neglect.”<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a></span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> 
		reporters were fascinated by the American Indian activists’ new 
		direct-action tactics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff writer William Greider wrote that while 
		many American Indians are uncomfortable with having to take such extreme 
		measures, they felt that high-profile demonstrations were the only way 
		to get results.&nbsp; He described the demonstrations at Alcatraz and Fort 
		Lawton as a reflection of two national issues: “One is the growing 
		concentration of Indian migrants in the cities and the problems they 
		face in adjustment…The other issue--job discrimination against Indians 
		by the Bureau [of Indian Affairs] itself.”<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The national 
		attention the Fort Lawton demonstration received, as well as other 
		Indian demonstrations and movements sparked by Alcatraz, pushed the 
		Indians’ cause all the way to the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 1970, the <i>
		New York Times </i>described a “pledge” by President Nixon promising 
		federal help for American Indians’ social service programs and Indian 
		centers, as well as land rights.<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		While this “pledge” was mostly symbolic and had little funding to back 
		it up, it was considered a step in the right direction by a number of 
		American Indian leaders.&nbsp; However,<i> </i>the <i>Washington Post </i>
		reported that President Nixon's “promise” later came under criticism by 
		Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy.<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Speaking at an Indian conference, Kennedy called for increasing Indian 
		participation in the BIA, and improving national policies to better 
		serve the American Indian population.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The occupation also 
		captured the attention and fascination of the world press.<i>&nbsp; </i>The<i> 
		Seattle Times</i>, while dismissing the occupation as “only a 
		demonstration with a teepee set up on a pleasant, sleepy military 
		reservation,” humorously discussed how this event was a fascinating 
		story in Europe.<a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		A representative of the Italian News Agency inquired, “Tell me, do you 
		have an Indian problem out there? ...Is it true you have 12,000 Indians 
		living in your city?”&nbsp; A reporter from the <i>London Daily Express </i>
		wanted to know if Jane Fonda had been handled roughly, instructing the
		<i>Seattle Times</i> reporter to call him if she said anything new.<i>&nbsp;

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The expansive media 
		coverage of the demonstrations at Fort Lawton signaled a shift in the 
		treatment of American Indians in the press.&nbsp; In her book,<i> Native 
		Americans in the News: Images of Indians in the Twentieth Century Press</i>, 
		Mary Ann Weston describes an overall change in journalistic style, as 
		well as changes in the coverage of American Indians from the 1950s to 
		the 1970s.<a name="_ednref24" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The 1950s was the era of “termination,” the US government policy to end 
		its relationship with and recognition of tribal governments, and 
		assimilate American Indians into white society.&nbsp; Weston wrote that 
		journalists either reported about “good Indians” who appeared to reject 
		their traditional cultures and assimilate into mainstream white society, 
		or “degraded Indians,” a poverty stricken people who were lazy, 
		alcoholic, or victims of unfortunate circumstances.&nbsp; The journalists 
		reported the stories in a style which relied on hard facts from official 
		sources. The news articles did not describe or characterize American 
		Indians or “get at the realities of native lives and cultures.”<a name="_ednref25" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the late 1960s, 
		the rhetoric and policies began to change from termination to 
		“self-determination,” a movement in favor of the Indians taking control 
		of their lives, institutions, and celebrating their cultures.&nbsp; The news 
		reporting style of that time became highly descriptive, interpretive, 
		and investigative, delving deeper into American Indian issues and 
		including their voices and opinions in the coverage.&nbsp; For the first 
		time, American Indian news stories were initiated and told by the 
		American Indians themselves.<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The Fort Lawton demonstration is an example of this; it was a UIAT-planned 
		event designed to attract the attention of the community and the press.&nbsp; 
		Bernie Whitebear and Bob Satiacum told their side of the story and were 
		quoted extensively in mainstream newspapers.&nbsp; </span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">With the rise of 
		American Indian activism, many new American Indian publications sprung 
		up in the 1960s and 1970s, providing a platform for American Indian 
		journalists to start their careers and report the news from an Indian 
		point of view. &nbsp;Locally, the <i>Indian Center News</i>, initially a 
		small weekly newsletter, expanded into a full-length newspaper with 
		extensive coverage of American Indian affairs.&nbsp; On the national level, 
		many new American Indian papers were founded, from <i>Indian Voices</i> 
		in Chicago to <i>Wassaja</i> in San Francisco.&nbsp; The American Indian 
		Press Association, founded in 1970, distributed news to over 150 Indian 
		publications.&nbsp; Each month, the Mohawk paper <i>Akwesasne Notes</i> 
		reprinted an extensive collection of American Indian-related news 
		clippings from mainstream, underground, and American Indian papers 
		throughout the country.&nbsp; These papers captured a wide American Indian 
		audience, providing coverage of tribal and urban Indians news as well as 
		broader issues affecting Indians.<a name="_ednref27" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

		increased visibility of American Indians in the press, mainstream 
		newspapers often still took a paternalistic or dismissive tone towards 
		American Indians, and used language that perpetuated stereotypes.&nbsp; The 
		mainstream Seattle press cast the Seattle Indian activists in the mold 
		of the age-old “noble savage” stereotype, portraying them as proud, 
		noble Indian “warriors.”&nbsp; On March 9, 1970 the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer </i>began their coverage of the demonstration by 
		writing, &quot;the ‘weekend warriors’ met the Indian warriors at Fort 
		Lawton,” playfully describing the event as a clash between white and 
		American Indian “warriors”, as opposed to a clash between military 
		police and peaceful protesters.<a name="_ednref28" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Equating the Fort

		the <i>Seattle Times</i> and the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> used 
		words such as “invasion,” “attack,” or “seize” to describe the UIAT’s 
		actions in many articles.&nbsp; Maribeth Morris of the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer</i> wrote, &quot;An ‘attack force’ of nearly a 100 Indians

		<i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer </i>reporter Richard Simmons wrote, “About

		Use of words such as “invasion” also plants the idea that these

		readers.&nbsp; In contrast, UIAT leader Bernie Whitebear characterized the 
		occupation as a modern, militant movement; while he described the 
		occupation as an “invasion,” he described the UIAT’s tactics as a

		The mainstream press portrayal of the American Indian activists was 
		reminiscent of much of white America’s perceptions of American Indians 
		in real and fictionalized 19th-century wars.&nbsp; This portrayal of the 
		United Indians of All Tribes as noble Indian warriors misrepresented 
		them as a group of uncivilized people “attacking” the fort.&nbsp; Well over a 
		hundred years ago, more than 250 of Custer's soldiers did, in fact, die 
		in the Battle of Little Bighorn; in the Fort Lawton demonstration, 
		however, it was the American Indians who were said to have been 
		brutalized.&nbsp; As opposed to being “warriors,” The UIAT was a group of 
		highly articulate, informed, and in many cases, college-educated

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">By appropriating

		emotions of the public.&nbsp; Many white Americans, often in a misguided 
		fashion, admired these “positive” stereotypes, and attempted to blend

		number of articles.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, on March 9, the first mention 
		of Fort Lawton in the <i>Seattle Times</i> was in an article about Jane 
		Fonda on the front page.<a name="_ednref56" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn56"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[56]</span></span></a>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jane Fonda's 
		presence, however, did little to quell the chaos that ensued between the 
		military police and the American Indians during the occupation.&nbsp; 
		“Evidently the military police wanted no witnesses,” she told the <i>
		Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> after being forcibly removed from Fort 
		Lawton.&nbsp; Fonda also went to talk to some soldiers at Fort Lewis, and was 
		subsequently arrested and banned from returning to either of the 
		military installations.&nbsp; Fonda made the news in the <i>Seattle Times </i>
		and the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer </i>again on March 16 and March 
		17, respectively, after she rallied with a group of 100 American Indians 
		outside the United States Courthouse before the arraignment of 10 Fort 
		Lawton demonstrators charged with trespassing.<a name="_ednref57" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn57"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[57]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">A writer for the <i>
		Helix</i> credited as “Roger” gave his opinion on the matter: “…she 
		attracted a lot of attention to herself and blurred the issue.”<a name="_ednref58" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn58"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[58]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		According to Roger, the dominating story on local television was “’Jane 
		Fonda Ejected from Fort Lawton’ with the Indians forming a picturesque 
		background.” She was asked by the local media whether she was there in 
		order to gain publicity for herself, rather than the Indian movement.&nbsp; 
		Fonda told reporters, &quot;This kind of publicity is doing me nothing but 
		harm… I could very well lose the Oscar because of this.”<a name="_ednref59" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn59"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[59]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Fonda was later 
		credited by many for initially helping to bring such widespread media 
		attention to the American Indian demonstration at Fort Lawton.&nbsp; In 1994, 
		Bernie Whitebear wrote, “the support and presence of Jane Fonda gave the 
		invasion and occupation worldwide attention, and captured the 
		imagination of the world press…Without really appreciating it at the 
		time, the Indian movement has achieved through Jane Fonda's presence, a 
		long-sought credibility that would have not been possible otherwise.”<a name="_ednref60" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn60"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[60]</span></span></a> 
		In his autobiographical book, <i>Humbows, Not Hotdogs! </i></span><i>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Memoirs of a savvy 
		Asian American Activist</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">, 
		Filipino-American activist Bob Santos also remembers how Jane Fonda's 
		celebrity attracted attention to his friend Bernie Whitebear's cause.<a name="_ednref61" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn61"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[61]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
		<i>The Times </i>of London also attributed the publicity of the incident 
		to Jane Fonda’s presence at Fort Lawton in the March 11, 1970 article, 
		“First and Last Americans.”<a name="_ednref62" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn62"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[62]</span></span></a>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although it seemed 
		the overall awareness of the press and the support of public were 
		growing, not everybody agreed with the UIAT’s objective to reclaim the 
		land to build a cultural and social service center.&nbsp; The American Indian 
		activists were seen by many as a nuisance, and a barrier to some Seattle 
		residents' dreams of a sprawling new city park.&nbsp; In December 1970, <i>
		Seattle Times </i>columnist Herb Robinson described the Indian 
		occupation of the fort as “only the latest in a lengthy series of 
		distractions which have threatened to obstruct acquisition&quot; of the 
		surplus acreage, and as “the most difficult hurdle” to park proponents' 
		success.&nbsp; He wrote that it would be “a tragedy of profound proportions” 
		for Seattle not to build the park.&nbsp; While acknowledging that Indians 
		need and deserve a place to provide social services, he argued that the 
		Indians could just as easily provide those services from another site in 
		the city, on land less valuable than the Fort Lawton grounds.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Others argued that 
		the Indians were already entitled to the land on the reservations, and 
		that giving them more land would not solve the problem.&nbsp; An editorial 
		from the <i>Bremerton Sun</i> described the Indians' actions at Fort 
		Lawton as “bordering on the ludicrous at least if not the bizarre,” and 
		“something out of an old ‘B’ movie.”<a name="_ednref63" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn63"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[63]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The editorial continued, “It might behoove some of those Indians making 
		so much noise about a cultural center to go home and improve those 
		reservations,” which the editorial claimed were full of garbage, 
		deserted homes, and rusted cars.&nbsp; The <i>Bremerton Sun</i> suggested 
		that Fort Lawton would be degraded to that condition if turned over to 
		the Indians.&nbsp; The editorial did not address the fact that thousands of 
		Indians, displaced from their tribal lands and then their reservations, 
		came to call the city of Seattle their home and live in its many 
		neighborhoods.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The press also 
		pointed out the lack of support from the local and national government.&nbsp; 
		The <i>Seattle Times</i> reported that Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson, 
		chairman of the Senate Interior Committee, said, “I strongly believe 
		that this particular urban site would be better suited for a city park.”<a name="_ednref64" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn64"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[64]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Louis R. Bruce, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, said that while the BIA 
		was not necessarily opposed to the occupations springing up around the 
		country, the Bureau could not assume responsibility for Indians living 
		outside their reservations.<a name="_ednref65" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn65"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[65]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Bernie Whitebear told the <i>Seattle Times</i> this lack of BIA 
		intervention was a result of “an unethical, political power play,” by 
		Senator Jackson, and alleged that Jackson had pressured Bruce to stay 
		out of the fight between Seattle and the Indians.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Seattle Mayor Wes 
		Uhlman sided with the senator.&nbsp; He told the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer</i> that he wanted the surplus land to be taken over 
		by the city of Seattle to build one of the most beautiful city parks in 
		the region.<a name="_ednref66" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn66"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[66]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Rather than give the UIAT any of the land, he offered to give them input 
		into how the city park would be developed.&nbsp; Other city officials were 
		equally unsupportive, and suggested that the UIAT should build their 
		cultural center on one of their reservations.&nbsp; Seattle Park Board member 
		Donald Voorhees told the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>, “I am afraid 
		that the ultimate result of the Indians’ activities may be to torpedo 
		the [Senate] bill for releasing the lands and then no one will he be 
		able to use it.”<a name="_ednref67" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn67"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[67]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Voorhees said that the city only would have only 409 acres on which to 
		build a park, when the Indians, such as the Yakima Tribes, have millions 
		of acres of reservation land on which they could build their cultural 
		facilities.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bernie Whitebear and 
		the UIAT firmly stood their ground on the idea that the land should be 
		returned to the Indians.&nbsp; Building facilities on reservations many miles 
		away from Seattle would not meet the needs of Indians living in the 
		city.&nbsp; Also, the Indians did not trust the government to give them 
		enough autonomy to run a facility on a city-owned park.&nbsp; “…what 
		difference would that be from control over us by the Bureau of Indian 
		affairs?” Bernie Whitebear asked while speaking with the <i>Seattle 
		Post-Intelligencer.<a name="_ednref68" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn68"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:baseline"><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[68]</span></b></span></span></a></i></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As news of the Fort 
		Lawton occupation and urban Indian issues reached readers throughout the 
		city, the United Indians of All Tribes gained support of many local 
		organized groups.&nbsp; At the University of Washington, the Indian Student 
		Association spoke out in support of the cause through the <i>University 
		of Washington Daily</i>.&nbsp; Reporter Barb Clements wrote, “Indian students 
		said they not only would support reoccupation forces at Fort Lawton, but 
		would also volunteer their services for the cultural and educational 
		activities planned on the property.”<a name="_ednref69" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn69"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[69]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Clements’ article included part of the UIAT proclamation, as well as a 
		statement issued by the Indian Student Association urging the public to 
		actively support American Indians in their struggle to preserve their 
		culture and to control their own destiny within the structures of 
		American society.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;In November 1970, 
		the <i>Medium</i>, a Seattle African-American newsletter, reported that 
		the Indian group had also gained the attention and support of the 
		Seattle Humans Rights Commission.&nbsp; The <i>Medium </i>reported that “the 
		Seattle Human Rights Commission has unanimously passed a resolution 
		which recognized the moral right of American Indians and Alaska natives 
		to Fort Lawton land.”<a name="_ednref70" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn70"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[70]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		The Seattle Human Rights Commission’s endorsement indicated increasing 
		Seattle community support; it was one of over 40 non-Indian 
		organizations in the area that supported the American Indian activists 
		in the Fort Lawton occupation.<a name="_ednref71" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn71"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[71]</span></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; Public sentiment 
		was on the side of the American Indians as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the 
		controversy with public officials and stereotypical language, the media 
		coverage played right into the growing public sympathy for American 
		Indians. Activism, in general, was on the rise in the 1960s and 1970s, 
		and the public was ready and eager to listen to the perspectives of 
		disadvantaged groups and move for change.<a name="_ednref72" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn72"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[72]</span></span></a> 
		&nbsp;Dozens of letters and petitions from around the Seattle area poured 
		into Mayor Wes Uhlman's office, pleading with the mayor to allow the 
		American Indian group the land they believed was rightfully theirs.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;In 1971, public 
		pressure forced the city government to meet the UIAT Council at the 
		bargaining table. After five months of negotiations, they finally 
		reached an agreement to “lease” 16 acres to the American Indians for 99 
		years with an option to renew.&nbsp; Not only was this a breakthrough for the 
		American Indian activists, who had successfully planned a three-week 
		demonstration and captured the imagination of the media and the public, 
		but it was also a breakthrough for the politicians involved who had 
		previously ignored the needs of urban Indians.&nbsp; Senator Henry Jackson 
		praised Bernie Whitebear for bringing the dispute to the bargaining 
		table, and said he would support the group's applications for federal 
		grants to help find their new social service and cultural center, now 
		known as Daybreak Star.<a name="_ednref73" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn73"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[73]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Deputy Mayor John Chambers told the <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>, 
		“…[Bernie Whitebear] represented something real, not something that was 
		going to fade away.&nbsp; What he showed us was that we were negotiating with 
		a people with real thoughts and needs.”

		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The UIAT 
		demonstrations at Fort Lawton had successfully captured the interest and 
		imagination of the press and the public.&nbsp; While some opinions expressed 
		in the newspapers were hostile or indifferent, many news articles 
		effectively informed the public about the challenges facing urban 
		Indians in Seattle, and sometimes called for public support.&nbsp; Many 
		Seattle citizens and organizations sided with the UIAT, and successfully 
		pressured politicians to listen to the activists’ claims and strike a 
		compromise.&nbsp; In 1977, Bernie Whitebear and the UIAT’s dreams came alive, 
		as Daybreak Star Cultural Center opened its doors to serve the Seattle 
		community.&nbsp; Today, Daybreak Star Cultural Center continues to provide 
		essential social services to over 25,000 people in the Seattle Indian 
		community, such as the Head Start educational program for children, 
		family counseling, and activities for seniors.<a name="_ednref75" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn75"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[75]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
		Each year, over 10,000 people attend the center’s annual Seafair Indian 
		Days Powwow, a celebration of American Indian arts and culture featuring 
		drum groups, arts and crafts, and performances by several hundred 
		dancers.

		Ramona Bennett, former chairwoman of the Puyallup tribe, told <i>Indian 
		Country Today</i>, “Hundreds of thousands of people knew Whitebear
