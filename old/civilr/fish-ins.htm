But the fish-ins are only part of the story.&nbsp; A unified and adept courtroom strategy provided by NAACP lawyers, the ACLU, and eventually the U.S. Department of Justice; the presence and assistance of members of numerous other organizations at the fish-ins and on associated protest marches; and, ultimately, the decisions of non-native judges and the influence of public opinion all proved crucial in upholding the rights of the tribes in Washington and bringing the issue of Native American treaty rights to the forefront of the civil rights movement.&nbsp; </span></p>
	  <p class="Body" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the courtroom battle has been meticulously described in books and articles, the fish-in protests themselves have received less attention and little has been written about the group that created and organized them: the Survival of the American Indian Society (SAIA).&nbsp; The southern Puget Sound fish-ins took shape in 1964 as civil rights protests coordinated by the newly formed SAIA with the critical assistance of other experienced organizations and individuals, including the NAACP and the National Indian Youth Council (NIYC). Indeed, certain elements of the SAIA protest campaign were consciously modeled on the actions of black civil rights protesters in the American South, while other aspects were creative modifications adapted to the unique situation.&nbsp; The NIYC, a Native American rights organization formed in 1961, contributed its rejection of cultural assimilation, which differed from the goals of the mainstream of the black civil rights movement.&nbsp; With their new methods of protest and advocacy of a strong and independent Native American culture, the NIYC elicited massive responses from the media, influential opposition groups, politicians, and government officials and was instrumental in altering general public opinion of Native Americans.&nbsp; For its part, the SAIA appropriated the public image of Native Americans that had arisen in the media, and turned elements of it to their own advantage.&nbsp; It also successfully worked to reframe previous history: arrests and incidents involving Native Americans that had taken place in the preceding decades were claimed as part of this civil rights campaign, creating a chain of &lsquo;protests&rsquo; stretching back into the 1930s.<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[1]</span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>
	  <p class="Body" style="text-indent: .5in; margin-bottom: .0001pt"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The overall results of the SAIA&rsquo;s methods proved to be far more successful than any previous attempts to resolve the fishing rights question.&nbsp; The fish-ins led directly to the most important legal case in the Native American fishing debate in the past one hundred and twenty years, <i>U.S. v. Washington</i>. While it did not end the conflict, the 1974 ruling, known as the Boldt decision, represented a near-total vindication of the Native Americans&rsquo; treaty rights claims.&nbsp; This landmark case in the federal courts ruled that Native Americans were entitled to the opportunity to take up to 50 percent of the harvestable fish and that they should have equal part in the management of the fishing industry through a tribal fisheries commission.&nbsp; Native Americans&#39; defense of their fishing rights did not go uncontested, however. In 1970 white sports fisherman began adopting the fish-in as a means of asserting their own &quot;civil rights&quot; <i>against </i> Native American fishermen. Ironically, this demonstrated the effectiveness of what had been accomplished in linking the SAIA&rsquo;s variety of protest to the general civil rights movement.&nbsp; </span></p>

In less than a year,&nbsp; Governor Stevens had the legal rights to over sixty four million acres of land, leaving the Native Americans less than 6 million acres broken up into reservations.<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[2]</span></a>&nbsp; The underlying assumption of all of these treaties was that Native Americans were not making proper use of the land, according to the standards of white settlers, and thus needed to be settled on designated reservations to take up farming, assimilating into the general American population in the course of a generation or two.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[3]</span></a>&nbsp; All of the treaties, however, did state that the &ldquo;right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations is further secured to said Indians in common with all citizens of the Territory.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[4]</span></a>&nbsp; This key clause was originally included for three reasons: Native American representatives generally would not sign without it; Stevens was in a rush to get the land signed over;<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[5]</span></a> and, simply put, so that the government would not have to supply food to the tribes during the transition period when they learned farming methods on their new reservations.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to Stevens, this expedient and pragmatic addition to the treaties would, in the 1960s, become the central issue of an important civil rights conflict.&nbsp; </span></p>

Washington</i>, leavening its support for fishing rights by insisting that the treaty &ldquo;leaves the state with power to impose on Indians equally with others &hellip; as &hellip; necessary for the conservation of fish.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[9]</span></a> In 1957 a split decision in <i>State v. Satiacum</i> was more definitive, ruling that the treaties &ldquo;will continue to be superior to the exercise of the state&rsquo;s police power.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[10]</span></a> However, in 1963 <i>Washington v.

Since World War II, these industries had expanded dramatically, far eclipsing the native catch.<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[14]</span></a> At the same time, the pressure put on the salmon and steelhead populations from increased pollution, hydroelectric dams, and runoff due to deforestation and development decreased the size of the runs just as the expanding commercial and sport fishing industries began to catch more and more fish.&nbsp; The result was a precipitous drop in the salmon and steelhead population. Predictably, authorities responded by stepping up enforcement of state regulations in the areas where fishing was most easily, cheaply, and visibly monitored, areas that were disproportionately fished by Native Americans.<a name="_ednref15" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn15"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[15]</span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

	  <p class="Body" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">But the state&rsquo;s methods were not always direct.&nbsp; For example, Milo Moore, Director of Fisheries in 1958, was publicly sympathetic to the fishing rights of Native Americans.&nbsp; He wrote, &ldquo;If any man or race of people merit consideration in a fishery beyond that of all others, the American Indians claim that right.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[17]</span></a>&nbsp; His plans for the future of the fisheries in Washington State involved recognizing Native American rights and working with natives to improve conservation and fishing methods in order to benefit all parties.&nbsp; However, despite the high sounding rhetoric of these statements, the reality in practice was somewhat different.&nbsp; News articles of the time made statements such as, &ldquo;Indians are exempt from state regulation, except as the tribes voluntarily agree to abide by them.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[18]</span></a>&nbsp; This appearance of voluntary consent covered up the coercion involved in the process.&nbsp; This article described a public hearing to discuss regulation of the Indian fisheries by the State Department of Fisheries, in mutual cooperation with the tribes.&nbsp; State regulations and the publicity for the modern and progressive conservation techniques proposed by State agencies and the influential Washington State Sportsmen&rsquo;s Council combined with a negative presentation of Native Americans in the media to create an atmosphere of blame. Native Americans were consistently portrayed in the media as non-compliant and backward in their resistance to new conservation laws that were intended for the public good.&nbsp; They had become an easy target: the power dynamic was against the Native Americans as a minority group with little power or voice. As a result, mutual cooperation more often meant coerced compliance on the part of Native Americans in order to avoid being scapegoated for problems with the fish population.&nbsp; </span></p>

Satiacum</i> became the major court case of the 1950s related to the &lsquo;Indian fishing problem.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, the split verdict it generated in 1957 in favor of Native American rights in formed a notably weak precedent, and even the tenure of Milo Moore, a Fisheries Director who was ostensibly sympathetic to the tribes, was insufficient to make it enforceable.&nbsp; By the early 1960s, state enforcement officials openly ignored the ruling and made numerous arrests, as well as confiscated boats and fishing equipment.<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[23]</span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

The public, media-driven image of Native Americans as anti-conservation, selfish, violent, even anarchic, was difficult for the natives to combat.&nbsp; The state cracked down, and in 1963 amended the laws based on Public Law 280 to extend civil jurisdiction without tribal consent over specified lands and some specific activities on all reservations.&nbsp; These actions initiated the first involvement of the Washington State Civil Liberties Union in the battle over Indian rights.<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[26]</span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

The NIYC was oriented towards furthering the survival of native culture through scholarships for Native American students, as well as pursuing many other associated causes nationwide.&nbsp; It was a vigorous opponent of the federal termination policy. The NIYC was a small organization based on its membership and annual budget, but effectively used publishing and mass media to attract widespread publicity to its campaigns. The costs for this activity alone made up over 93 percent of the NIYC&#39;s budget in 1965.<a name="_ednref38" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn38"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[38]</span></a> Hank Adams, who arrived on the scene shortly after the first protests in February, was an Asiniboin-Sioux and a member of the National Indian Youth Council.

In fact, even as the protests increased, tribal attempts at conciliation moved forward.&nbsp; On June 21st, 1964, the Intertribal Council of Western Washington adopted a resolution calling for an independent study and survey of the Washington State fisheries as a whole, as a beginning for a cooperative conservation management system. &nbsp;The resolution was then presented to the Senate Subcommittee on Indian Affairs on August 5th, 1964.<a name="_ednref68" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn68"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">[68]</span></a>&nbsp; There was no attempt to implement the group&#39;s recommendations, but the continued call for compromise and balanced, independent viewpoints shows that the Indian community was not monolithic in its position on the fish-ins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> </p>

The many arrests of the extended 1968 protests also created massive publicity, highlighted by coverage of the trial of Hank Adams, head of the SAIA and one of the major Indian spokesmen. As he was not associated with any local tribe, Adams was able to make claims of Indian solidarity as part of his defense, turning accusations about his lack of a stake in the matter into a positive statement of Native American unity. As a tiny minority, Native Americans acting by themselves had had little impact on public opinion during the previous decades, but after a few short years of coordinated protest, in combination with a growing national focus on minorities and civil rights, public opinion was finally shifting. </span></p>
