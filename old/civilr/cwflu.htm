		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The United 
		States took possession of the Philippines in 1898 and in the decades 
		after that,
Filipinos, mostly men, began to make their way to America to seek employment, 
		especially in the fields and canneries. In 1933 some of these men formed 
		the first Filipino-led union ever organized in the United States: the Cannery
Workers’ and Farm Labors’ Union Local 18257. Based in Seattle, it was organized 
		by &quot;Alaskeros&quot; who worked in the Alaska salmon canneries each summer and 
		in the harvest fields of Washington, Oregon, and California in the other 
		seasons.&nbsp; The union
was in its shaky beginnings when two of its founders were murdered. Yet, 
		although its leaders were dead, the union would not die. Instead in
the next few years,&nbsp; it grew stronger, becoming effective up and down the West 
		Coast. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This paper investigates the early history of the Cannery Workers’ 
		and Farm Laborers' Union and the sense of pride and fraternity within the Alaskero brotherhood 
		that made the union possible. Much of the credit has to be given to the 
		Filipino community. The workers believed in 
		community and unity. The Cannery Workers’ and Farmers’ Union’s motto was 
		&quot;Unity is Strength.&quot; This motto and spirit kept the union 
		together 
		after the death of its founders, Virgil S. Duyungan and Aurelio Simon. The union elected
a new president and soon emerged stronger than before. The camaraderie and
fraternity within this group of men helped them build a successful union, one of 
		the first lasting organizations led by Asian American workers.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For many Filipino men, the opportunity to 
		come to America was like a dream. After they had been under 
		imperialistic rule by the United States, they had been taught in the 
		American-run school system that 
		the United States was a place of great opportunity. As U.S. nationals 
		they had the right to travel to the mainland even after immigration laws 
		prevented other Asians from doing so. Although they were Asian, they were, 
		in the eyes of white Americans our &quot;Little Brown Brothers.&quot; 
		They still faced discrimination, but because of their colonial status 
		they were able to come to America even after other immigration from Asia 
		had stopped. Most who came were single men in their late teens to early twenties and had only 
		up to a high school education.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Men came for different reasons, but 
		primarily for the opportunity that was in their eyes so rich in America. 
		Ted Abuan of Tacoma Washington recalls his reasons for coming to
America, &quot;In 1928 I came to the United States, ‘land of opportunity,’
where I planned to work my way through college, I graduated from high school. My
desire to pursue a higher education was during a poor time because of the
Depression.&quot; This was true for many young men during this massive
wave of Filipino migration. Many hoped to go to college and some enrolled at the 
		University of Washington. They had a desire for education, but had to
work for that education. Thus, they ended up getting contracted out of Seattle
to work in the canneries up in Alaska. These young men would work there year
after year and it became a subculture for them. They still were in search of an
education, but found this education elsewhere and many didn’t make it to the
university. One of the later presidents of the union recalls his quest for
education and his dual role as a cannery worker, &quot;We did not earn much
money during the summer times, especially I just arrive in the country and I did
not know any other job, except go to the cannery. So I didn’t make enough
money to continue the whole year of my schooling.&quot; So, many men stuck to
their jobs up in the canneries and lost their dream of an American education.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There were many factors that &quot;pushed&quot; the 
		Filipinos out of the Philippines and &quot;pulled&quot; them into America. The 
		idea of this American Dream, the opportunity that they could receive, 
		and ultimately an education was a major pull factor for early Philippine 
		immigration. A prominent Filipino leader during this age recalled that &quot;one of the greatest benefits rendered to the 
		Filipinos by the United States was the giving of opportunities to 
		intelligent, ambitious and industrious but poor Filipino students, to 
		come to the United States to secure a college education.&quot; 
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The center for many of the Filipino 
		immigrants was Seattle. This was the major assembly point for many immigrants from the 
		Asia. The Chinese, Japanese and now the Filipinos called the Northwest 
		and the city of Seattle their home. In Seattle, Filipinos found work 
		through the contract system and would find themselves in the canneries 
		in Alaska or the fields of Yakima Valley. The contractors were men of 
		color like them, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino. Seattle also was 
		the housing center for many young Filipino men when there was no work 
		for them or in between seasons. In Seattle they could find 
		gambling halls, hotels full of laborers, dance halls, and saloons. 
		Seattle was similar to the pioneer cities where workers would flock 
		and congregated. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The canned salmon industry had a long history 
		as a job sector for Asian American workers. The canneries 
		used a dual system of labor: minority workers would do the undesirable 
		jobs like cutting and canning, while those higher up the chain were able 
		to do the fishing and contracting of the industries laborers. At first, 
		the canneries employed Chinese workers. In the 1880s and 1890s most of 
		the workers were Chinese. In recognition of this when a&nbsp; machine 
		was introduced to mechanize part of the fish-cleaning process it was 
		called the &quot;Iron Chink.&quot;&nbsp; Yet, because
of the Anti-Chinese sentiment in the Northwest and the anti-Chinese legislation
including the Exclusion Act of 1882, the number of Chinese laborers were
declining. Thus, the industry had to find another minority to fill the spot.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This spot was filled by the Japanese 
		workers. They dominated the cannery workforce for only 
		a short amount of time due to another Asian exclusion act of 1924. Again there was a shortage of workers. 
		The first Filipino Alaskeros appeared in the canneries around 1911, with 
		more and more Filipinos coming in the 1920s. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once in these jobs, Filipino workers 
		noticed that there was definitely a dual labor system. They were hired 
		only for the least desirable jobs. Treated as the inferior, they faced 
		discrimination and difficulties in the canneries. Because of these persecutions, 
		some workers decided it was 
		time to organize. Before the Filipinos tried to organize, the Chinese 
		had also tried to fight the system. But they were unsuccessful in their 
		attempt to strike. The Alaskeros started a grassroots
organization campaign.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another reason for organization was because of the 
		anti-Filipino race riots that occurred in Kashmere and the Yakima Valley 
		in 1927-1928, which then spread from eastern Washington to the fields in 
		California. Filipino agriculture workers were killed and their 
		bunkhouses were destroyed. Faced with prejudice and hostility, many men 
		were determined to protect themselves through organization.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Back at the center of the industry in 
		Seattle, men would come together in the pool halls and dance halls. At 
		these venues, they began to talk about organizing together as workers 
		and demanding an end to the dual labor system of employment. They would 
		converse within a social setting in the pool halls and dance halls, yet 
		they were serious in their discussions. They wanted to be treated better 
		by their employers.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the organizers major goals was to 
		do away 
		with contract labor and stop the corruption associated with labor 
		contracting. Tony Rodrigo, one of the original union activists, recalled 
		the reasons the men wanted 
		to end the contract system, &quot;. . . you know the wages of these boys, why we 
		actually pay them directly to the boys, see. So we get rid of all the 
		contractors.&quot; The Filipino Alaskeros wanted to get rid of the middleman.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The workers’ eyes did not see any benefits coming from the contractor, they only saw one 
		man taking another man’s profits away from him. The &quot;game&quot; that the 
		contractors’ played basically was a &quot;’forcing’ of new employees to pay a 
		fee (bribe) to ensure
employment.&quot; The fee came in from different avenues including:
&quot;outright monetary payment,&quot; &quot;withdrawing fees from one’s
seasonal check,&quot; or &quot;a more subtle form in that of requiring new
employees to purchase blankets and supplies from a contractor’s store located
either at the departure point or at the facility itself.&quot; This contracting
system was fully backed by many of the workers’, this was primarily due to the
fact that they didn’t know what they were getting themselves into and the fact
they weren’t going to get a job without the contractors’ help.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The Great Depression aggravated the 
		discontent in the canneries and with the contract system. As the 
		economic crisis hit the Northwest in the 
		early 1930s, competition for jobs grew fierce and the contractors were 
		in position to exploit the desperation of the men. The system worked like this: the 
		contractor would give special privileges to his &quot;barcada&quot; or townmates. These men would
receive special treatment and thus receive the best jobs, while others had to 
		pay high fees to the contractor for the privilege of working in the 
		canneries.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus, major efforts for a union began. 
		The Alaskeros credit the success of the
organization of the union to its first president Virgil Duyungan, who was an
excellent orator and charismatic leader. Others who took part in the major
organization of Local 18257 were
Ponce Torres, Casamiro Abella, Antonio Rodrigo, L.V. Molina, Leo Roduta, C.B.
Mislang, Leon Bellosillo, and Aurelio Simon. 
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">These men had picked a hard time to start to
organize in the winter and spring of 1933 with so many men out of work and 
		desperate for jobs. But it was what they needed to do and they were 
		remarkably successful. From the pool halls and dance
halls, men talked about the benefits of organization, realizing that they needed 
		a union to protect the rights of cannery and
farm workers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus, on June 19, 1933, the
American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Cannery Workers’ and Farm
Laborers’ Union Local 18257, which was the first of its kind in the United
States. Shortly after the union was launched the battle would begin.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The union’s first task&nbsp; was to 
		wipe away the contract labor system. The contractor’s tactics included 
		the using of &quot;barcada&quot; to recruit,
taking advantage of new, and desperate immigrants, while denying union 
		supporters jobs. They also tried to discredit the union, calling it a communist organization. 
		Whereas, the union was using collective bargaining as a technique to 
		establish increased
pay, less working hours, receive overtime and have adequate food supply and
housing. The support of the union was now backed by the majority of the workers. 
		In 1933 the union membership had 200 members, three years later in 1936, the
membership rose to 2,000,&nbsp; again showing how the Filipino Alaskeros came together
to better themselves and their community. An article from the
<i>Philippine American Chronicle</i> shows that the &quot;Union Helps Get Workers
Wages&quot; and that the union is making a huge effort to help workers get their
back wages from Japanese, Chinese and Filipino labor contractors.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although they still had not completely 
		rid the industry of the contractors, many of their demands were reached. 
		After the initial success of the union, the contractors were not pleased. On December 1, 1936 in a restaurant in Seattle, 
		the nephew of a labor contractor awaited the arrival of President Virgil Duyungan and the secretary of the union, Aurelio Simon, whom he had
invited to the Chinatown restaurant. As the two labor leaders were sitting down
to a meal, the nephew shot and killed them. As the <i>Seattle Daily
Times</i> reported it, the two men were killed at a &quot;Japanese cafe&quot; and
the nephew was critically wounded by one last shot fired by Duyungan. The 
		wounded gunman, labor contractor Placido Patron, explained in his defense
that the reason for his shooting was because the two men &quot;’had been
trying to cut in on his hiring-hall business and he wouldn’t let
them.’&quot; He later confessed that &quot;’[he] did all the shooting, and
then Virgil shot [him].’&quot; 
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The death of President Duyungan was the last
ditch effort on the part of the contractors. They thought they would have no more worries
about the union with the death of its founder, but the Filipino Alaskeros and
the leaders of the union proved them wrong.<o:p>
</o:p>The death of Simon and Duyungan only brought shame and more hostility towards
the contractors. Duyungan and Simon became martyrs for the union
and all laborers in Seattle. Thus, the men of the CWFLU all came together to
recognize the accomplishments of their leader and hundreds of men came to the
memorial services of their brothers in fraternity, Brothers Duyungan and Simon.
The funeral service and parade that followed was the largest ever given to
Filipinos in the United States including that of the Philippine President Quezon
in 1944 in Washington, D.C. Within the union, a committee was formed to
investigate the murders and a Memorial Fund Committee was created and actively
		supported. Not only the members of the Seattle union, but Oregon and
Californian unions contributed to this cause. Also, other major labor unions
including the Seattle Labor Council helped in the recognition of the brothers, again proving the unity the union shared immediately after this tragedy. Both
men became martyrs in this community.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The deaths did not kill the union. The 
		men came together to make major decisions. The first would be the new 
		president. The vice-president, Casimiro A.
Abella, immediately stepped up and regained order in their union and in November
1937, a democratic election was held and Irineo R. Cabatit was elected president
and a new charter was written with the cooperation of Conrad Espe, a Norwegian
American and considered one of the best leaders of the labor movement. This
helped in the progress of the union.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once Cabatit took over the presidency, many major events occurred within the
union. One was the establishment of the closed shop, which eliminated the
contract system completely and created plentiful jobs for the union members.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another major issue that occurred was in 
		1937-38, the CWFLU came into conflict
with the American Federation of Labor. The A. F. of L. had a long history of 
		racism and discrimination, especially towards Asians. When the 
		Filipino-led Cannery Workers Union affiliated with the AFL in 1933, the 
		Federation claimed to have changed.&nbsp; The A. F. of L.
advertised in a handbill that &quot;the A. F. of L. fights discrimination&quot;
and that &quot;racial and religious prejudice are against union principles,
racial and religious prejudice are used by anti-labor forces to divide workers,
racial and religious prejudice are undemocratic, and racial and religious
prejudice weaken our unions.&quot; This promise to its unions and the workers of
its federation did not stand true. The members of Local 18257 felt the
discriminations that the American Federation of Labor were forcing upon its
members and their criteria for membership. Thus, the men decided to break away
from their affiliation with the A. F. of L. According to minutes taken from a
regular membership meeting, &quot;explained Flynn motive of splitting the
Cannery Workers’ and Farm Laborers’ Union---as a craze for race and
nationality; a motive tallying with the purpose of the Packers to weaken out
stronghold; and as initial effort to disown and get rid of us.&quot; What
happened was the opposite. The A. F. of L. did not even have a chance to get rid
of their minority affiliation, but the C. W. and F. L. W. found a supporter of
their goals.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On April 12, 1938, the final transition 
		from the American Federation of Labor to the Congress of Industrial 
		Organizations was made. This major decision was finalized, only two 
		years after the death of its president and secretary. The union were 
		making major decisions and moving forward full force. The men voted for 
		this change of affiliation unanimously, again proving the fraternity of 
		the union. The United Cannery, Agricultural, Packinghouse and Allied 
		Workers of America-CIO (UCAPAWA) was formed and the A. F. of L. was no longer in the
cannery business. This was the birth of Local 7. According to the preamble of
the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Benevolent Association Constitution, the
purpose of the union was &quot;to assist in disseminating principles of
industrial unionism by education and publicity; to assist in organizing
unorganized workers; to forward their collective interest of the labor
movement.&quot; After the switch, many more accomplishments were recorded. The
leadership and fraternity of the union stayed strong and the men proved their loyalty to each other as Alaskeros and continued their strength through unity
years after the death of their founding fathers.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By the time Trinidad Rojo took the office of presidency in 1939, the union had
made major steps in its transition to be a major player in the labor organizing.
Rojo continued to strengthen his union and the men continued to support their
fellow Alaskeros. There were no major confrontations and disagreements with the
union the few years following the two murders.
</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before the Filipinos organized, Asian 
		Americans had never built a lasting union.&nbsp; 
		Yet, the fraternity and common goals that these Filipino men shared 
		helped them create a successful&nbsp; union and change much of the 
		mistreatment of their industry. The fight still continued into the 1980s 
		and is slowly dying down. According to the old timers, the union now is 
		not the same as it was during the days of Duyungan, Trinidad Rojo, and 
		Ponce Torres. These men really fought for what they felt was right and put heart and soul into
their actions. The reason for success was their willingness never to let down. Even with the tragic deaths 
		of the founders, leadership was regained and the union was moving
strongly into the future. With unity and perseverance, the members of Filipino 
		labor union made their mark on the Northwest labor movement. <o:p>
