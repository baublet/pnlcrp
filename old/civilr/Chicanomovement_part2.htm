	UW MEChA was much more than a political action group. Its efforts on behalf 
	of Chicano students and community members included a multifaceted focus on 
	social and cultural matters, as well as educational and political 
	objectives. Cultural organizations and initiatives sponsored or supported by 
	MEChA had a significant impact throughout the Pacific Northwest. The 
	cultural promotions of MEChA included Teatro Campesino, Chicano/Latino 
	graduation, Christmas “posadas,” Cinco de Mayo celebrations and other social 
	events to meet the needs of students who were often far removed from their 
	respective communities.<a name="_ednref42" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn42"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[42]</span></span></a>

	students also sponsored lecture and film series, rap sessions, food and 
	clothing drives, dances featuring acts like Little Joe, Eligio Salinas, and 
	Los Lobos, as well as numerous Latino festivities and workshops. In 
	addition, MEChA invited national leaders to the UW campus to talk to 
	students about events taking place in other parts of the country. Such 
	speakers included Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta of the United Farm Workers 
	of California, Reies Lopez Tijerina of the Alianza Federal de Mercedes in

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The Puget Sound gave rise to a dance troupe called Los 
	Bailadores de Bronce (The Bronze Dancers), which soon developed into a 
	long-standing community institution.<a name="_ednref46" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[46]</span></span></a> 
	Established primarily by faculty and staff from the University of Washington 
	in 1972, the group evolved to include community members. Its purpose was to 
	share Mexican dance, music, and cultural traditions with the community. As 
	the years progressed, the dance group performed all over the West Coast and 
	established itself as one of the oldest groups of its kind in the Northwest. 
	Los Bailadores de Bronce contributed to the cultural development of the 
	Chicano community in the Northwest, much like numerous other cultural 
	initiatives undertaken during this period. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">El Teatro del Piojo was another key cultural entity that 
	developed under MEChA. Established in 1970 with the help of former UW 
	professor Tomas Ybarra-Frausto, the theatre collective reflected the reality 
	most Chicano students encountered growing up in rural Central Washington. 
	Inspired by El Teatro Campesino,<a name="_ednref47" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[47]</span></span></a> 
	the UW group was comprised of students involved in both Las Chicanas and the 
	Brown Berets, including Epi Elizondo, Bea Maldonado, Rita Trujillo, Eseban 
	Sambrano, Genaro Apodaca, Sid Gallegos, Art Gallegos, and Cathy Cantu, among 
	others. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">El Teatro del Piojo was the first so-called ‘guerrilla 
	theatre’ group in the Northwest. Many of the short skits, or ‘actos,’ were 
	emblematic of this period of the movement, which emphasized the struggle in 
	the fields as well as the experience of alienation through interaction with 
	the dominant power structure. Throughout its existence from 1970 to 1979, 
	the group performed all over the West Coast and became a member of Teatros 
	Nacionales de Aztlan or TENAZ (National Theatre [Collectives] of Aztlan). El 
	Teatro del Piojo later spawned a more traditional acting troupe known as El 
	Teatro Quetzalcoatl, formed in 1975, which performed politically charged 
	plays. Often referred to as the &quot;voice&quot; of MEChA,<a name="_ednref48" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn48"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[48]</span></span></a> 
	the theatre collective was instrumental in the emergence of the new Chicano 
	identity in the Northwest. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journal <i>Metamorfosis, </i>produced out of El Centro de 
	Estudios Chicanos at the University of Washington, was another important 
	cultural component of the Chicano movement. Though it lasted only from 1977 
	to 1984, <i>Metamorfosis </i>was instrumental in providing a forum for 
	academic work on Chicano/Latino arts and culture in the Northwest during a 
	period when the movement at the national level was beginning to wane. The 
	journal was especially important considering the relative isolation of 
	Seattle from the Chicano cultural hubs of the southwest. Chicano scholarly 
	work in the Northwest would make an impression that, coupled with the 
	emergent muralist art movement, influenced the discourse on Chicano/Latino 
	identity in the State of Washington. </span><b>

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Seattle was the site of 
	ground-breaking work in the field of Chicano art during the 1970s, with much 
	of this work coming out of the University of Washington. Though Seattle 
	lacked the cultural nutrients of cities in the Southwest, local painters 
	Emilio Aguayo and Daniel Desiga became two of the most notable Chicano 
	artists through their connections to artist collectives in California and 
	the Southwest like the Rebel Chicano Art Front (RCAF), a Sacramento-based 
	artists’ collective that served as a major link between Movimiento art in 
	California and the Pacific Northwest. Seasoned artists from RCAF served as 
	mentors for young Chicano artists in the Northwest and also produced three 
	Pacific Northwest murals.<a name="_ednref49" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[49]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">This inspiration, infused with a distinct style centered in 
	the Northwest, would be essential in the work done by Desiga. The only 
	Chicano artist of this period who was native to the area, Desiga's work is 
	emblematic of the Chicano experience in eastern Washington. Desiga’s 
	personal history as a product of farm worker origins is reflected in his 
	portrayal of male and female workers in rural eastern Washington. Some of 
	his notable work includes the murals at El Centro de La Raza in Seattle,<a name="_ednref50" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn50"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[50]</span></span></a> 
	as well as a mural depicting Mexican farm workers, painted in 1990 in 
	Toppenish, Washington. His style, distinct from his contemporaries, 
	passionately engages the viewer in examining the socio-political context of 
	Chicano life in the Northwest. Along with Aguayo, Desiga is perhaps the most 
	influential Chicano muralist of the period. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Originally from Denver, Colorado, Emilio Aguayo made his way 
	to the Pacific Northwest in the early 1960’s. In 1971, while a student at 
	the University of Washington, Aguayo painted <i>Aztlán</i>, the first 
	Chicano mural in the region. The mural is now prominently displayed at the 
	University of Washington's Ethnic Cultural Center.<a name="_ednref51" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn51"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[51]</span></span></a> 
	Upon completion of <i>Aztlán</i>, Aguayo wrote a description explaining the 
	imagery and the color scheme used in producing the final piece:</span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">This mural embodies the dawning of a new era for all the Spanish 
	speaking people known as &quot;LA RAZA.&quot; It is a cultural blend of past and 
	present, of Indian heritage, of man struggling alongside women in the human 
	conflict which is our drive for self-identity and self-determination. This 
	painting is visual testimony that as part of this society, we are part of 
	its past, its present and its future, something which as a people we will 
	not be denied. </span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">We are also a people with ideas in heart, mind, soul, and spirit 
	who have lived a history of social oppression, yet....we have hopes for our 
	future.</span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">We are products of mankind--a composite of all races, all colors, 
	yet more the blend of Spaniard and Indian which forms the mestizo precursor 
	of the American Spanish-speaking, here 100 years and more before Columbus. 
	We had a civilization which predates Christ.</span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">Present and past symbols of our cultural history comprise this 
	visual reality of early la raza art. Serpent and sun are symbols worshipped 
	by our ancestors as gods of life and earth. Earth now is symbolic only of 
	the nation within a nation we wish to build. The sun also symbolizes the 
	dawn of our self-awareness, the revolution in the mind we so desperately 
	need. The united farm workers flag is symbolic of first manifestations in 
	1965 of our current social movement. Man and woman symbolize the core of any 
	society, the family unit. In this case, the Raza family is what kept us 
	together in adversity.</span></p>
	<p style="margin-left:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:black">Society is seen as a four-head monster of apocalypse, oppression 
	and universal troubles of mankind. It is seen as we see it and live it. 
	Society is thus a personification of oppressive evil now confront by social 
	change which is good.</span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chicano 
	art movement of the 1970s produced the vast majority of the muralist imagery 
	that is still around today. However, one key exception is a work painted in 
	1945 by world-renowned artist Pablo O’Higgins entitled, &quot;The Struggle 
	Against Racial Discrimination.&quot; O’Higgins moved to Mexico at the age of 
	twenty and studied under the guidance of Diego Rivera.<a name="_ednref53" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn53"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[53]</span></span></a> 
	By the time he was commissioned to paint the mural in Seattle, he had 
	already achieved status as one of the great muralists of the period. 
	Although the O'Higgins mural predates the Chicano student movement, Chicano 
	student activists played a key role in restoring it to public view during 
	the 1970s, showing once again the importance of cultural politics in the 
	Chicano movement. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The mural was commissioned by the Shipscalers, Drydock and Miscellaneous 
	Workers Union in Seattle during a period when the union was involved in a 
	number of civil rights campaigns, including protesting the police shooting 
	of Eugene Mozee, a black service station owner, and supporting a fair 
	employment practices law pending in the state legislature.<a name="_ednref54" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[54]</span></span></a> 
	Needless to say, this activism was ahead of its time. The civil rights 
	movement would take another two decades to come to the forefront after the 
	mural was completed in 1945. In addition to their progressive stance on 
	civil rights, the Shipscalers were emblematic of the radical labor politics 
	of the pre-World War II era. According to a <i>UW Daily</i> article written 
	in 1977, &quot;many of them were militant—drawing on the labor movements of the 
	1930’s. Seattle was a little more than 20 years away from its 1919 general 
	strike and less than a dozen years away from a popular description of 
	Washington state: ‘The 47 states and the Soviet Socialist Republic of 
	Washington.’”<a name="_ednref55" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn55"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[55]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Drawing upon this unique activity, O’Higgins coalesces both 
	militant labor imagery and issues of civil rights. Staying true to his 
	politics, he also incorporates Marxist imagery, much like his mentors did in 
	the Mexican Muralist Movement of the previous decade. The painting is unique 
	in the sense that it addresses the issue of social justice within a rights 
	discourse and points at ideas that were before their time in the 1940s. As 
	such, the O'Higgins mural is arguably the first of its kind in the 
	Northwest, considering that few of the Mexican Muralists ventured to the 
	region during that period.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The piece was first suppressed in 1955 during the McCarthy era and then 
	forgotten due to institutional negligence. It remained in storage until 1975 
	when, as Lauro Flores observes, &quot;the impetus of the Chicano movement forced 
	its restoration and vindication.&quot;<a name="_ednref56" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn56"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[56]</span></span></a> 
	The politics of public art were evident as subject material deemed too 
	controversial was set aside for a prolonged period until pressure from El 
	Centro de La Raza and UW MEChA convinced the University of Washington to 
	restore the mural. Now displayed in Kane Hall, the mural is invaluable not 
	only as a part of the history of the Chicano community of this area, but 
	also of the collective history of Washington State. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Even as the Chicano Movement subsided in the 1980s, the main 
	contributions to the arts lived on through the imagery of the muralist 
	movement. Despite the geographic isolation from cultural hubs in the 
	Southwest, the Chicano/Latino community has forged an identity that is 
	uniquely its own, that incorporates the geography of the Pacific Northwest 
	into its art. As Tomas Ybarra-Frausto has written, the “acute sense of 
	isolation and dislocation is tempered with a striving to generate new 
	horizons and new mythologies with an aim to reflect through literature 
	diverse aspects of Chicano life in the region.”<a name="_ednref57" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn57"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[57]</span></span></a>

	the UW campus. This battle between students and university administration 
	would only intensify throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. At times, 
	frustration at the slow pace of change led to demonstrations, the occupation 
	of buildings, and the filing of complaints to state agencies dealing with 
	civil rights.<a name="_ednref58" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn58"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[58]</span></span></a></span></p>

	</span></font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">As the month 
	progressed, activity intensified as information about hiring practices came 
	out. On the 13th of May, between 75-100 students occupied and ransacked the 
	office of the Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.<a name="_ednref61" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn61"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[61]</span></span></a> 
	The protest was a result of the college's decision not to hire Dr. Carlos 
	Mun&#61469;oz as a new professor at UW, as well as the university's general 
	unwillingness to recruit Chicano faculty. The Munoz issue would be bitterly 
	debated over the next several years. According to former student activist

	Munoz was still fresh on the minds of many as the 1974-1975 academic y ear 
	started. With the hiring issue still unresolved in the spring, a crisis 
	developed when support for the student protests led to the firing of the 
	head of the Chicano division of the Educational Opportunity Program<i>. </i>
	Then in May the UW fired two more Chicano administrators for their 
	participation in activities protesting the university’s hiring practices.<a name="_ednref63" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn63"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[63]</span></span></a>

	For its part, MEChA responded with a resolution condemning the firings. A

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the

	This put MEChA at odds with faculty as students felt they were marginalized

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The animosity 
	between students and faculty during the hiring debates further took shape in 
	1978 during what students deemed the transformation of the EOP programs. The 
	reorganization of EOP was met by resistance from students who felt their 
	voices were being silenced and that the high administration at the Office of 
	Minority Affairs was making decisions without consulting students who would 
	be affected by the proposed changes. UW MEChA occupied the Chicano Division 
	of the Educational Opportunity Program and organized a ‘sick-out’ with 
	counselors to protest the reorganization of the EOP program at UW.<a name="_ednref68" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn68"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[68]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The struggle expanded over 
	the next two years, culminating in the occupation of Schmitz Hall, the 
	central administration building at the University of Washington. Twenty 
	Asian and Chicano EOP students occupied the offices of EOP Vice-President 
	Herman Lujan on May 21st, 1980, demanding his resignation and an end to the 
	new restrictive admissions practices.<a name="_ednref69" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn69"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[69]</span></span></a>

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The 1980s signaled the end 
	of many of the initiatives pushed by the student movement. An ideological 
	shift away from cultural nationalism was one factor in the decline of 
	movement activism. The internal fissures present in a student movement that 
	included cultural nationalists, Chicano Marxists, as well as students who 
	advocated for a moderate stance and the conversion of the group into a 
	'social' organization also hampered the movement in the 1980s. This process&nbsp; 
	played out with various MEChA chapters in the Southwest as well.</span><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Almost four decades after it began, the Chicano Movement 
	still has a visible impact. As a result of activism at the grassroots level 
	on the part of various communities of color, there has been a fundamental 
	change in how people talk about race, which is a lasting effect of the 
	broader Civil Rights Movement. The most visible results of the Chicano 
	Movement are still primarily within academia, with the establishment of 
	numerous student centers at college campuses all over the country that cater 
	to students of color as well as the establishment of Chicano Studies 
	Departments, research centers, academic journals, and so on.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The literary and art movements of the 1970s have also left an 
	indelible mark on the Chicano/Latino community. The production of art 
	centered on issues such as racism, human rights, and equal access to 
	education and employment continues today. The discourse has also expanded to 
	include issues of class, gender, nationality, and cultural identity.<a name="_ednref70" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn70"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[70]</span></span></a> 
	Though the Chicano art movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s has waned, 
	the work these artists left behind continues to inspire today’s Chicano 
	youth and influence the discourse on Chicano culture.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">At the local level, the movement gave rise to community 
	institutions, helping to build a Chicano community where none had existed 
	before. Alliances with other communities of color were essential to the 
	movement’s success. The broad alliance for civil rights that emerged allowed 
	for further progress within the Chicano community at a time when the local 
	population was miniscule in comparison to the urban Chicano communities of 
	the Southwest. This collaboration across racial lines was a unique 
	development in the Northwest, and is an integral part of the legacy of civil 
	rights activism in the region. The development of the Chicano community was 
	also a result of work that was done on both sides of the state, with 
	activism in the Yakima Valley providing an impetus for much of the activist 
	work in the Puget Sound region as people, especially students, migrated to 
	western Washington. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Activist youth organizations are also still operating on many 
	campuses. MEChA declined during the 1980s, with low numbers at many campuses 
	and many chapters becoming inactive, but has experienced a revival since the 
	mid 1990s, partly in response to the massive anti-immigrant backlash in 
	California, as well as the attacks on affirmative action and other programs 
	throughout the country.<a name="_ednref71" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn71"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[71]</span></span></a> 
	The first National MEChA Conference was organized in 1994 at Arizona State 
	University. This was one of the first attempts to unite the various chapters 
	from around the country under similar goals. A National Coordinating 
	Committee was formed in the wake of the conference, as were regional bodies, 
	such as the Pacific Northwest MEChA Region, to take on issues at the local 
	level.<a name="_ednref72" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn72"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[72]</span></span></a> 
	Essentially, this meant that regions functioned as semi-autonomous chapters 
	with the ability to formulate their own policies in accordance with what was 
	needed. As such, the Pacific Northwest had a different focus than Southern 
	California. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">During this period, numerous colleges and high schools would 
	establish MEChA chapters for the first time, making the student-led 
	organization one of the largest in the country, with approximately 250 
	chapters from the West Coast all the way to the Northeast. It was also 
	during this time that the organization re-evaluated its stance on key issues 
	such as the struggle of indigenous peoples against neo-liberal economics and 
	support for human rights and economic justice, among others. The new stance 
	was outlined in the MEChA Philosophy Papers that were drafted in the late 
	1980s and early 1990s and officially adopted by the National Coordinating 
	Body.<a name="_ednref73" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn73"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[73]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The late 1990s witnessed renewed activist activity centered 
	on opposition to I-200 on the UW Campus. The initiative was voted into law 
	in November of 1998, officially removing the affirmative action policies 
	instituted at the state level in the 1960s and 1970s. The opposition to 
	I-200 echoed the concerns of the previous generation of Chicano student 
	activists as the issue of access to education once again came to the 
	forefront. An immediate impact was felt after the initiative passed with the 
	dramatic drop in students of color accepted into public universities. As a 
	result, MEChA joined forces with other organizations to organize and 
	implement informational events to assist prospective students in the process 
	of applying to schools. UW MEChA has organized the <i>Adelante Con Educacion</i> 
	Conference every year for the last twelve years. The conference is geared 
	toward the outreach and recruitment of prospective Chicano students from 
	throughout Washington State.<a name="_ednref74" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn74"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[74]</span></span></a></span></p>

	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;

	This time the occasion was the World Trade Organization ministerial, held in 
	Seattle in December of that year.<a name="_ednref75" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn75"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[75]</span></span></a> 
	The contingent based out of the UW dressed in black and red as a sign of 
	solidarity with the Zapatistas in Chiapas, Mexico. Since 1994, the 
	Zapatistas have waged a battle against neo-liberal economic policy, which 
	not only makes living conditions worse for the poor and working classes, but 
	also threatens the very existence of the indigenous people in Mexico’s 
	poorest state.<a name="_ednref76" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn76"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[76]</span></span></a> 
	The “Battle in Seattle,” as the WTO demonstrations were called, disrupted 
	the meetings and effectively ended the round of talks. More importantly, the 
	demonstrations drew international attention to the negative ramifications of 
	globalization for the world’s underclass.</span></p>

	issues ranging from support for House Bill 1079 in 2003, which allows

	Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as opposition to U.S. Intervention in Latin

	A few days prior to the start of Spring Quarter at the UW, there were

	including mass walkouts from high schools throughout the Southwest. It took 
	only a few days before the first protests were organized in the Yakima 
	Valley, where 650-700 students walked out of Davis and Eisenhower High 
	Schools, and in the Columbia Basin, where Pasco High students were aided by 
	Columbia Basin College MEChA. Approximately a week after the Los Angeles 
	rally a march was organized in Yakima.<a name="_ednref80" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn80"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[80]</span></span></a> 
	From there, the movement spread to colleges and universities as the Pacific 
	Northwest MEChA Region (PNMR) organized three simultaneous demonstrations at 
	Western Washington University, the University of Washington, and Central 
	Washington University. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In organizing the event, the PNMR made it a point to emphasize 
	human rights, not strictly Latino rights, and to resist attempts by the 
	media to portray the protests as Latino-centric. It was especially important 
	for demonstrators to be inclusive of other immigrant communities, as the 
	immigration bill under consideration would also adversely affect emigrants 
	from Asia, Africa, and Europe, in addition to the Americas. The action was a 
	success, with the event making it onto the front page of the <i>University 
	of Washington Daily</i> and sparking widespread discussion on campus. </span>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the City level, an organization called Comite Pro-Amnistia y 
	Justicia Social (Committee for Amnesty &amp; Social Justice) took the lead in 
	organizing various events. The Committee, formed in 1999, was created with 
	the intent of organizing Latino immigrant communities around issues of 
	civil, labor, and human rights.<a name="_ednref81" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn81"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[81]</span></span></a> 
	The group organizes many events throughout the year, including an annual 
	march on May 1st in solidarity with immigrant workers. The first major 
	immigration rights march was organized on March 18, 2006. The march received 
	little attention in the press, despite having over 5,000 participants. This 
	demonstration preceded the massive movement that would evolve later on that 
	month. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first National Day of Action that was called for by

	On April 10th, Seattle hosted one of the largest non-violent marches in its

	The second march on May 1st had similar results as it registered 
	approximately 60,000 participants and coincided with a national one-day 
	boycott of all goods. The boycott received&nbsp; support in Latin America as news 
	of the movement made the international press. The massive groundswell of 
	opposition to H.R. 4437 has stalled the bill’s progress through Congress for 
	now. It appears as though there will be no action until after the 2006 
	elections. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immigration rights movement still lacks direction as to what 
	strategy it will employ and what objectives it will seek. It emerged 
	organically as many people became aware of the implications associated with 
	the anti-immigrant backlash. However, the fact that the movement did emerge 
	highlights the importance of the issue and the need to address it in most 
	communities. The idea of the instant criminalization of millions of people 
	forced millions more to take a strong stance for the rights of all 
	individuals regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, or legal status.</span></p>

	</span></font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;There 
	is hope for the future. The student walkouts this spring surpassed the L.A. 
	Blowouts of 1968 as the largest mass demonstration of high school students 
	in American history. The marches also stand as one of the largest 
	mobilizations of people for a non-violent movement. It remains to be seen 
	what will happen next, but as many of the marchers pointed out this spring, 
	“today we march, tomorrow we vote.”</span></p>
