		    <p><strong> </strong>In the early 1960s, Jan Van Pelt went to Pacific School of Religion at the University of California-Berkeley, where she met her husband Dale and was first exposed to the activist milieu of the Free Speech and Civil Rights movements. Prompted by the equality espoused by their Christian faith, the Van Pelts both became involved in the California Migrant Ministry (later known as the National Farm Worker Ministry) which organized church workers to provide community services for migrant farm laborers. The Van Pelt&rsquo;s first paid job was in 1965, through the National Farm Worker Ministry, doing community service work in the rural town of Mendota, California. </p>
		    <p> In Mendota, Jan was exposed to the extreme poverty and racism that migrants faced in their rural company towns. Farmworkers received poverty wages, and with no union or collective power to protect their rights, faced numerous abuses by their employers, including harassment, forced overtime, no access to water or toilets, shoddy housing facilities, and dangerous working conditions. Most farmworkers were Filipino and Chicano migrants, and they, alongside the African-American workers, faced extreme racism on the job and in their communities, which contributed to feelings of disempowerment. </p>
		    <p> In the early 1960s, two organizations were founded to organize migrant workers and give them a collective voice, the largely Filipino/a Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and Cesar Chavez&rsquo;s National Farm Workers&rsquo; Association (NFWA), which was mostly composed of Chicano/a workers. In the mid-1960s, the National Farm Worker Ministry made a decision to broaden their community service work into a more political campaign and organizing drive to support the unionization efforts among migrant workers. Jan and Dale Van Pelt moved to Delano, California, to begin working in the first major campaign of the unions, the Delano Grape Strike. AWOC and the NFWA had joined forces to organize the grape pickers, who were refusing to harvest grapes until they received a fair wage. Jan Van Pelt was part of the early work in Delano, walking workers&rsquo; picket lines and providing office and community support for their families. </p>
		    <p> To broaden public knowledge of the strike and increase its power, Cesar Chavez called for a national consumer boycott of non-union grapes. The Van Pelts moved to the Seattle area to coordinate the boycott campaign in the Northwest. Jan and Dale worked to bring church congregations, community organizations, and labor unions into the campaign, giving numerous talks on migrant conditions in California and showing films and slideshows to dramatize the issue. The Van Pelts organized constant pickets, boycotts, and protest actions at local grocery chains, barely stopping for the birth of their daughter, Julie. The Northwest boycott eventually succeeded in pressuring the grocery chain QFC to sign a contract with union grape workers. </p>
		    <p> Jan Van Pelt found that her organizing with farmworkers shaped her life&rsquo;s trajectory, transforming her Christian faith and connecting her to other social struggles at the time, contributing to what she calls an era of &ldquo;great tumult&rdquo; and possibility for social transformation.</p>
		    <p>Jan Van Pelt agreed to share her memories of farm worker civil rights activism in two videotaped interviews, one conducted by Trevor Griffey, the second conducted by Trevor Griffey and Maria Quintana. Above are streaming-video excerpts in windows media format. </p>
