	<p align="left" class="arial10"; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: .0001pt">On February 8, 1967, the body of 24-year-old Raisa Trytiak, a Seattle bank employee and former University of Washington student, was found in a garbage dump in Snohomish County. The young woman, who lived with her parents, had died from an embolism caused by a botched abortion. She had been six months pregnant. There were indications that she might have been strangled. The next day, Jack Blight, a 61-year-old retired construction worker, was arrested and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  He was sentenced to probation for a term of twenty years.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
	<p align="left" class="arial10">The lenient sentence was unusual, the rest not at all. Abortion was illegal in Washington until 1970, permitted only when the life of the mother was endangered. But countless women found ways to terminate pregnancies and some died doing so. </p>
    <p class="arial10">One month after Raisa Trytiak's fatal abortion, Elizabeth Zack Staley died in Olympia. She was 22 years old and newly married. Her husband, Ronald Jae Staley, and a 19-year-old female friend evidently performed the botched surgery. He was found guilty of abortion and manslaughter and sentenced to a more typical term: fifteen years in prison.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
    <p class="arial10">Raisa Trytiak and Elizabeth Staley were among the many victims of Washington State&rsquo;s restrictive laws. Today, as more and more states undercut the 1973 <em>Roe v. Wade</em> decision and limit access to safe abortions, it is useful to take a look back and consider the consequences.</p>
    <p class="arial10">How many women died from botched abortions in the Seattle area? We have scoured the <em>Seattle Times</em> and other newspapers  and have found <strong>thirteen</strong> reported fatalities between 1945 and 1969. This is by no means a complete count.  Newspapers reported only  cases that came from the police blotter involving criminal charges and did not report all of them. Other cases never came to the attention of the police. Medical authorities underreported abortion deaths, missing some, reluctant to embarrass families by reporting others.</p>
    
	<p class="arial10">Historian Leslie Reagan explains that it is hard to disentangle mortality statistics</font> because coroners and hospitals had so many different ways of reporting maternal deaths. Consequently there is much uncertainty about the death toll from illegal abortions, with nationwide estimates ranging from hundreds to thousands of American women dying each year. We don't know the Washington death toll.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">{3]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
    <p class="arial10 style20">But we do know something about thirteen women who died because abortion was a crime.  In addition to<strong> Elizabeth Staley</strong> and <strong>Raisa Trytiack</strong>, the known victims are <strong>Sharon Hoag, Beatrice Fisher, Beulah LeClair, Mary Johnson, Irene Timmons, Bettye Porter, Patricia Parrish, Martha Alit, Claudette Sayles, and Patricia Dickinson</strong>. Here are details on each tragedy including the criminal prosecutions that followed.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
    <p class="arial10">Most were young but several were married and Martha Alit left behind nine children. They were of many ancestries, including two African Americans, and a Native American. Raisa Trytiak had been born in Russia. What they had in common was that they all died at the hands of illegal abortionists, most of whom, like Jack Blight and Ronald Staley, lacked medical training and operated in bathrooms or kitchen tables. </p>
    <p class="arial10">Compounding the tragedy was the near invisibility of these deaths. Mostly these were not big headline stories. Readers of the <em>Seattle Times</em> would have had to look carefully through the inside pages of the newspaper to notice the tiny articles that marked these deaths. After Sharon Hoag died on February 1, 1963, the <em>Times</em> ran a three inch article at the bottom of page two with the succinct headline: &quot;Girl's Death After Abortion Investigated.&quot; Claudette Sayles' passing on July 30, 1960 was marked by two inches on page three: &quot;Murder Charge Filed in Death of Woman.&quot; Treated as crime stories, the news focused mostly on arrests, trials, and punishment, saying little about the victims and never raising the issue of why these women were driven to take such risks. </p>
    <p class="arial10"> We learn more about the alleged abortionists. Three were medical professionals: Dr. Frank C. Hart, a surgeon who was convicted of manslaughter and abortion in the 1945 death of Beatrice Fisher and sent to prison for 20 years; Dr. James Unosawa, an osteopath, who was convicted in two separate abortion deaths and spent 18 months in prison; and Ida Wrench, a nurse who was charged in two deaths. The others include a husband, a lover, and a female friend all of whom seem to have been assisting in do-it-yourself abortions. And there were several amateur practitioners who  made a living from illegal abortions. Marjorie Folsom ran a Seattle sanitarium that police described as an &quot;abortion racket.&quot; She was sentenced to twenty years after the death of two women in 1946. Lee Blue, a former nightclub operator, had twice served time for abortions before he was arrested in 1963 following the death of Sharon Hoag. He received a life sentence as an &quot;habitual criminal.&quot; </p>

    <p class="head14">Elizabeth Zack Staley, 22, Olympia <span class="arial10"> <br>
      (died March 6, 1967)</span></p>
    <p class="arial10">Elizabeth Zack worked in a Centralia drive-in theater. She had married 22-year-old Ronald Staley less than two months earlier, not long after discovering she was pregnant. For reasons now unknown they decided to end her pregnancy with the help of a 19 year-old friend, Donelle Hulse, who evidently had some experience inducing abortions and at whose house the fatal operation took place. Elizabeth suffered an air embolism and died as  her husband rushed her to the hospital. Ronald Staley and Hulse were arrested on manslaughter charges. The two defendants blamed each other and Hulse decided to plead guilty on the eve of the trial. Staley was convicted after a trial that was followed closely in the <em>Daily Olympian</em>. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. No word on what sentence Hulse received. Elizabeth Zack Staley was buried in Centralia.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4b]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

	<p><span class="head14">Raisa Trytiak, 24, Seattle</span><br>
      <span class="arial10">(died February 8, 1967) </span></p>
	<p class="arial10">	      Born	in Russia and brought to America as an infant, she grew up in Seattle, graduated from Ballard High School and briefly attended the University of Washington. A year before her death she took a job as a key punch operator with Seattle First-National Bank. Why she sought help from Jack Blight, a 61-year-old construction worker and avid fisherman, is not known. He was a neighbor and family friend. She was almost six months pregnant and the abortion attempt caused an  an air embolism that killed her. Why there were marks on her neck that led the coroner to suspect that she had been strangled was not explained in any of the news coverage that followed. Nor was the curious fate of Jack Blight who pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter and took responsibility for dumping the body. Blight  was sentenced to probation instead of a long prison term typical in such cases. An article in the <em>Everett Herald </em>suggests that the Snohomish County prosecutor accepted Blight's claim that someone else had been primarily responsible for the abortion.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
	<p class="arial10 style20">In death, Raisa Trytiak helped bring about an important set of changes. The news coverage attracted the attention of a group of men and women who decided to do something about the state's cruel and restrictive abortion law.

        <span class="arial10">(died February 1, 1963) </span></p>
    <p class="arial10">          Twenty years old and living in her parents home in Ballard, Sharon Hoag must have heard about Lee Blue through a network familiar with illegal abortion providers. The former night club operator had an extensive criminal record and had already served five years for criminal abortion. Moreover he was awaiting sentencing on a second conviction when he and live-in companion Helen Olson operated on Hoag in their Capitol Hill home. Complications set in the next day and by the time family members drove her to Ballard Hospital it was too late to save the young woman. Blue was charged with manslaughter as well as abortion. After a hung jury on the manslaughter charge, he eventually pled guilty. He received a life sentence with the provision that he must serve at least thirteen years.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a></span></span> </p>

        <span class="arial10">(died July 30, 1960) </span></p>
    <p class="arial10">          Claudette Sayles was one of two African American victims of the state's punitive abortion law. The newspaper says she was a student and that she lived in an apartment on 23rd near Madison. Mae Etta Scott (22) also resided in the Central District and had lived in Yesler Terrace as a youngster. Scott claimed that she had assisted only in the early preparations for the abortion that was performed in Sayles' apartment and that took her life. The police did not believe her and charged her with 2nd degree murder, an unusually severe charge. But when the jury heard the case, they accepted the defense claim that Scott's actions had not caused the death and voted to acquit. <span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

    <p class="arial10">          Born in Juneau, Alaska, she had lived in Seattle for twenty years with her Filipino husband and was already the  mother of nine children. Her husband, Felicisimo, was away on Coast Guard duty when she sought the services of Dr. James Unosawa, an Osteopath known to perform abortions. She died in his office. Unosawa had served time in prison after an earlier fatal abortion in 1946. He was convicted again of manslaughter in the death of Martha Alit, but the Supreme Court reversed the decision two years later, holding that the prosecution had not disproved his claim that he was trying to save her life. <span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">He would be arrested for a third time in 1963, after another patient required emergency hospitalization. Convicted, he was granted probation after agreeing to stop practicing medicine. <a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

    <p class="arial10">          The African American mother of two flew to Seattle from her home in Anchorage evidently seeking an abortion. After friends reported her missing, her body was found in a remote area near Gig Harbor. Norman Wade Austin was charged with manslaughter and two others as accessories. Police charged that Austin, 34, a mechanic by trade, had performed the abortion in the massage parlor he had recently opened in the Savoy Hotel at 1214 2nd Ave. Austin, who also faced charges for running a stolen car ring, spent several years in prison.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

    <p class="arial10">          The mother of two died in an Aurora Avenue motel in Seattle. The coroner reported that she had &quot;spent two hours in a bathtub of steaming hot water and had taken four medicinal capsules at thirty minute intervals.&quot; She had left Bremerton that morning in the company of Frank Womac Jr.,who described himself as a friend. They had registered as Mr and Mrs Womac. The 28-year-old married machinist was arrested and charged but later released on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Patricia Porter's husband, a Bremerton Jeweler, suffered a heart attack upon learning of his wife's death.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

        <span class="arial10">(died March 18, 1946) </span></p>
    <p class="arial10">          One month after her husband, Roy, was discharged from the military, Mary Johnson told him she wanted to end their four year marriage. A week later he returned to the couple's Capitol Hill apartment to find her gravely ill. She told him had had an abortion at a north Seattle sanitarium run by Margaret Folsom. She died that night in the hospital. The husband may have tried to blackmail Folsom. He was later charged with extortion. Three days later Folsom and nurse Ada Wrench were arrested and charged with manslaughter and abortion. Police claimed that the sanitarium, located in a four bedroom house at was &quot;part of a widespread abortion racket.&quot; Folsom and Wrench soon faced charges in a second fatality (Irene Timmons). Sentenced to twenty years in prison, their convictions were overturned by the State Supreme Court in 1947. In a second trial Folsom was convicted only on an abortion charge and sentenced to ten months in County jail.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

    <p class="arial10">          The Kingston housewife was the second woman to die as a result of a procedure performed by Margaret Folsom. According to the brief article, Folsom who was out on bail for the Mary Johnson fatality, operated on Mrs. Timmons on May 8 and &quot;the woman died four days later.&quot; Police charged that Folsom had established a new office &quot;set up as an abortion mill&quot; since her arrest two months earlier. It is not clear what happened to this case. Folsom's trials in conjunction with Mary Johnson's death are described above. <span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

He had called the police for help after she had collapsed but she died before she could be taken to a hospital.

        <span class="arial10">(died December 2, 1945) </span></p>
    <p class="arial10">          Identified in the newspaper as an &quot;Indian girl&quot; from Shelton, Beulah LeClair had evidently learned of Dr. Unosawa's services from Francisca Guada, his nurse. It is not clear what went wrong in his Jackson Street office. Newspaper coverage begins with a report that Unosawa had been indicted on 2nd degree murder, manslaughter, and criminal abortion charges. He was convicted on all three charges and sentenced to 20 years. Higher courts overturned the two most serious convictions but let the criminal abortion finding stand. Dr. Unosawa began serving a five year sentence in 1948. Mrs. Guada who had also been  indicted was informed in 1948 that the prosecutor had dropped the charges. Unosawa appears to have served about 18 months before winning release from Walla Walla prison. He was later implicated in the death of Martha Alit in 1954. <span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a></span></span></p>

    <p><span class="head14">Beatrice Fern Fisher, 35 , Edmonds </span><br>
        <span class="arial10">(died March 5, 1945) </span></p>
    <p class="arial10"> The mother of three had obtained an abortion once before from a medical professional. Pregnant again, she and her husband decided that for financial reasons she would terminate this pregnancy which may have been in its fifth or sixth month. She sought help from Dr. Frank C. Hart, a prominent Seattle surgeon who allegedly often provided abortion services. She returned home that evening but began to experience complications and the next day returned to Dr. Hart's office. He treated her but minutes later, in the lobby of the downtown building where his office was located, she collapsed and died. </p>
    <p class="arial10">The arrest and trial of Dr. Hart received more news coverage than  the other cases discussed here. He denied performing the abortion, claiming that he was treating her after she had performed a self abortion. At the same time he made a statement &quot;bitterly indicting society,&quot; for denying women reasonable options. He reportedly said that &quot;thousands of girl workers and wives of service men&quot; were getting into trouble and then taking desperate measures. </p>
    <p class="arial10">Hart was convicted of manslaughter and criminal abortion in October 1945. Sentenced to 20 years, he surrendered in November 1947 and began serving his term in Walla Walla penitentiary. The 61-year old surgeon suffered a stroke and died a year later.<span class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
