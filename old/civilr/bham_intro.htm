	riot and hosts the documentary video, <em>Present In All That We Do</em>.</span></span></p>
	
    <p class="arial10 style1 style2">Located in the northwest corner of Washington State, just shy of the
	Canadian border, Bellingham boomed in the early 20th century as a center of extractive industries like 
	mining, fishing and timber. Workers from all over the world arrived in Bellingham looking for jobs, including a sizable number  from Asia.</p> 
	
	<p class="arial10 style1 style2">In the early 1900s, Asian immigrants  numbered in the hundreds and were a substantial presence in Bellingham, sustaining small communities with their own restaurants, pool halls and 
	barber shops. Yet, due to sustained campaigns of racism and exclusion, little to nothing of these 
	communities remains in the city today. By 1950, city census numbers reported a mere eight individuals 
	of Asian ancestry.</p> 

	<p class="arial10 style1 style2">The most visible manifestation of these campaigns was  
	the riot of 1907. A group of South Asian migrant workers arrived in Bellingham in 1906, employed mostly 
	in the city's lumber mills. Immediately, white labor leaders demanded the South Asian workers be expelled 
	from the city, claiming the newcomers took jobs away from white workers and drove down wages.</p> 

	<p class="arial10 style1 style2">On September 4, 1907, the demands of white labor culminated in a vicious riot. 
	White workers broke into lumber mills and pulled South Asians from their work, then entered South Asian 
	bunkhouses, destroying property and stealing valuables. All night, South Asians were driven to the 
	city limits; others were taken to the city jail by police, ostensibly for protection. Within days, the 
	South Asian community was gone, having been, in the approving words of one local newspaper, "wiped off the map."</p>

	<p class="arial10 style1 style2">The riot, and the persistant racist campaigns that led to it and continued 
	long after it, continue to have lasting effects on Bellingham today. Only since United States immigration 
	reform in the 1960s have any substantial amount of non-white immigrants returned to Whatcom County.</p> 

	<p class="arial10 style1 style2">This special section on the 1907 Bellingham riots was created by Andrew Hedden, 
	based on historical material collected for the film <em>Present In All That We Do</em>. It includes the film itself, an 
	historical essay by David Cahn, a collection of newspaper articles, as well as archival photographs and documents.

By David Cahn.</a></b>  The 1907 riots in Bellingham were part of a much larger wave of anti-Asian violence along the Pacific coast. The campaigns culminated in racist immigration laws that excluded Asians and denied them U.S. citizenship.</font></p>

Newspaper editors were generally sympathetic with the rioters, and  news coverage reflected this overt racism.
