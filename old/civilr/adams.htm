            <span class="arial10">Bishop John Hurst Adams grew up as the son of Reverend E.A. Adams in Columbia,

		  South Carolina.&nbsp;He attended Boston University for his theology degree

		  at the same time as Rev. Martin Luther King; was made president of Paul Quinn

		  College in Waco, Texas at age 26 in 1956; and moved to Seattle to serve as

		  pastor of its oldest and one of its most prestigious black churches, First

		  African Methodist Episcopal (AME), in 1962.&nbsp;

            </span>
            <p class="arial10">During his time in Seattle, from 1962 to 1968, Adams was a key spokesperson

            for the African American movement for civil rights during its most intense

            period.&nbsp;He chaired the Central Area Civil Rights Committee and co-founded

            the country&rsquo;s first war on poverty agency, the Central Area Motivation

            Program.&nbsp;Along with NAACP leader Charles V. Johnson, Urban League

            Director Ed Pratt, and CORE and later Model Cities Director Walter Hundley,

            Adams participated in what he has called &ldquo;an inner circle&rdquo; of

            local civil rights leaders whose coordinated leadership transformed Seattle&rsquo;s

            social movement politics.&nbsp;While in Seattle, the Seattle Chapter of

            B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith named him Man of the Year in 1964, and the Seattle

            Urban League named him Man of the Year in 1965.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="arial10">In 1968, Reverend Adams was moved by his Bishop to serve as pastor of

            Grant AME Church in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.&nbsp;After 22

            years as a pastor, he was made Bishop in 1972.&nbsp;He retired from active

            service in the church in 2004, and currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="arial10">Bishop Adams shared his memories of Seattle&rsquo;s Civil Rights Movement

            in a videotaped interview conducted by Trevor Griffey and Janet Jones

            on June 24th, 2005.</p>
