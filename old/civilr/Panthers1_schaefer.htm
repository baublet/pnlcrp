		American civil rights movement has benefited from the contributions of 
		various individuals and organizations that have employed a variety of 
		strategies.&nbsp; In the early and mid 1960s under the leadership&nbsp; of 
		Dr. Martin 
		Luther King, Jr. the movement achieved breakthrough victories using non-violent civil disobedience. 
		Yet while his strategies brought some successes, King experienced his 
		share of frustrations.&nbsp; These setbacks and other historical realities encouraged some African Americans 
		to pursue alternative methods.&nbsp; One product of that search for 
		alternatives was the Black Panther Party, a chapter of which was founded 
		in Seattle in 1968.</span></p>
      <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle

      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Seattle</st1:place>
      </st1:City>
      ’s black population had been quite small for much of its history, during 
		World War II it grew by 413% as blacks came west to work in the region's 
		defense industries.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[1]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Seattle</st1:place>
      </st1:City>
      blacks had been more or less forced to live in what was known as the 
		city’s Central Area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That 
		trend continued both during and after the war.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[2]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Hence, just like in other cities, blacks were socially quarantined 
		into a small district of the city, a neighborhood that offered limited 
		housing opportunities and second rate facilities and infrastructure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
      </span>
      </span>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Though Seattle’s black population had been historically small, the 
		city had been no stranger to racial problems Generally speaking African 
		Americans were never denied their right to vote or demonstrate, nor were 
		they ever the victims of systematic violence.&nbsp; However, they were 
		constantly confronted with hiring discrimination and housing 
		restrictions, along with some instances of police brutality.&nbsp; Many of 
		Seattle’s blacks fought back in one form or another, some by 
		participating in civil rights and self defense organizations including 
		the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Universal Negro Improvement 
		Association, the Congress of Racial Equality, and the National Negro 
		Congress, the Nation of Islam, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
		Committee, and the Black Panther Party.</span></p>

      </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Black 
		Panther Party became known as one of the most radical and violent of the 
		black civil rights organizations.&nbsp; In some cases, this persona was 
		justified.&nbsp; The group existed in numerous cities across the nation and 
		during its initial years each chapter promoted armed militancy as its 
		primary tenet.&nbsp; Shootouts between Panthers and police bear witness to 
		the seriousness of the Panthers’ pledge.&nbsp; That a chapter would emerge in 
		Seattle, a place where racism existed, but was perhaps less severe than 
		in other American cities, might seem surprising.&nbsp; But the fact that the 
		chapter did form there reveals the complexities of the civil rights 
		movement.&nbsp; The Party’s existence in Seattle shows that racism does not 
		have to be violent to be intolerable.&nbsp; At the same time, the Seattle BPP 
		revealed that a group that is willing to resort to violence is not 
		predestined to always employ that strategy in order to meet its aims.&nbsp;
		</span></p>

		<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>One final point worth considering is that most cities that had a 
		BPP chapter had politicians who exhibited a strong urge to confront and 
		destroy the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>

      <st1:place w:st="on">

      <st1:place w:st="on">

      </st1:City>
      	, however, was different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As 
		stated earlier, though racism in <st1:City w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      	Seattle</st1:place>
      </st1:City>
      	was real, it could still be described as muted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The existence of a tempered racism created an opportunity for some 
		state and local leaders to take actions and make statements that could 
		certainly be termed tolerant, if not conciliatory, toward the Party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These actions can be understood as just one more example of the 
		independence that has predominated in Northwest politics for quite some 
		time.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[3]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      city, as well as across the nation, had heard many promises with
      regard to the attainment of racial equality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>However, time and time again, the promises were only partially
      kept, or simply forgotten. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Consequently
      some Seattle blacks felt that they had invested enough patience and hope
      into the government and available civil rights institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A handful of Seattle blacks concluded that the platform of the
      newly formed Black Panther Party offered a more affective method of
      securing the fruits of racial equality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The presence of the BPP in Seattle raised the civil rights debate
      in the city to a new plane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      debate revealed both a heightened black consciousness as well as a
      countervailing white concern about what steps blacks might take to project

      and Elmer Dixon were the two oldest sons in this family and they were
      molded by their parents’ stories.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      recall being active in protest at an early age when they marched with
      Martin Luther King during his visit to Seattle in 1961.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[5]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As the two boys grew to adulthood in Seattle, both had their own

      </span>Aaron, who is one year older than Elmer, learned of racism’s
      cruelties first hand when he became one of the first students in Seattle
      to be involved with the city’s voluntary school integration program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He eventually attended the predominantly white Queen Anne High
      School.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While there Aaron said
      he experienced a subtle form of racism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He received unusually poor grades and he said he noticed that the
      teachers did not treat him or the other black students the same as his
      white classmates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
      he often was the target of racially derogatory remarks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Racism came in other forms as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Aaron recalled participating on a Seattle Parks Department tennis
      team that competed for the city championship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His teammates were all Black players save for one white Jewish
      player.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They played an
      all-white team for the city title at the Lake Washington Tennis Club, a
      venue that had a segregationist policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The prize for the winning team was lunch at the club and time in
      the facility’s swimming pool.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aaron’s
      team won.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This represented a
      challenge to the tennis club’s policy, but the club did not back down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Ultimately only the Jewish player was allowed inside to enjoy his
      lunch, while Dixon and the other Black players had to eat hot dogs outside
      in the parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>None of
      the winners were able to enjoy the pool.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[7]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>Elmer Dixon’s early experience with race was different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He said that up until the age of seventeen he “was not consumed
      with race.” Elmer noted that his family lived in the Madrona
      neighborhood, a predominantly African-American community that was also
      home to numerous other races.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“My
      friends were a full reflection of the rainbow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I had friends that were Chinese, Japanese, Latino, and white.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But Elmer recalled racism’s affects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“My mom was denied a job because she was black.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>She called up on the telephone at one place and they told her that
      she could have the job when she got down there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When they saw that she was black, they told her they did not have
      any jobs left.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[8]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>These two anecdotes represent just some of the indignities that
      blacks faced while growing up in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Incidents like these compelled Aaron and Elmer Dixon to search for
      a way to effectively react to the treatment they received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Of the options that were available, the Dixons would eventually
      conclude that the Black Power movement offered the best promise.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The term “Black Power” has been traced to a speech given in
      1965 by then New York Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[9]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The actual ideology behind the term came well before that, as its
      ideals can be seen in the movement of Marcus Garvey and the Harlem
      Renaissance of the early 20th Century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Black Muslim movement, which began in the 1930s, also promoted
      the philosophy of racial solidarity and pride.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But it was not until the 1960s that Black Power gained broader
      acceptance in black America when Stokely Carmichael, the leader of the
      Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) co-opted James
      Meredith’s attempted Freedom March through the state of Mississippi in
      1966.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then in 1967, Carmichael
      published <i>Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America</i>, a
      manifesto that called for Blacks in <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

      Power’s arrival in Seattle did not occur on one particular day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But the theory certainly became much more relevant within the city
      after Stokely Carmichael delivered a set of speeches there on April 19,
      1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During his visit,
      Carmichael addressed an audience of around 4,000 listeners at the
      University of Washington.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      then spoke to another 6,500 people at Garfield High School later that
      afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmichael
      reiterated the themes of his book by criticizing whites for their role in
      denying Blacks their freedom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      said it was time for Blacks to experience a “new day” as well as
      strike back for the “church bombings, the cattle prodding and shooting
      of our homes.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He discussed
      Black Power, defining it as a “coming together of black people to fight
      for their liberation by any means necessary.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He explained that he preferred to use the word “Black” as
      opposed to “Negro” when talking of African Americans because, “We
      are Black and we are beautiful.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According
      to a reporter, the predominantly black listeners of various ages were
      enthralled with the message.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[13]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>Aaron and Elmer Dixon were in the Garfield High audience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Though they heard the same words, they initially left the speech
      with different conclusions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost
      four decades later, Aaron Dixon recalled Carmichael’s speech as being a
      turning point in his life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“For
      the first time I heard a black person speaking very defiantly against
      white Americans and racism….It was very powerful and very electrifying
      and it totally changed me.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon
      noted that Carmichael’s speech prepared him to take a more active and
      militant approach to civil rights. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“I
      think that the interpretation that I had was that it was a new day, that
      no longer would we sit idly by and be beaten up, or let racist incidents
      happen without some kind of repercussions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If we had to burn the whole city down, that’s what we would
      do.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[14]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Elmer, who was sixteen years old at the time, was not equally
      affected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“I didn’t know
      who this guy was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I remember
      walking away from there thinking, oh, that’s B.S.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It doesn’t matter what the color of your skin is or what clothes
      you wear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>My best friends were
      white….”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Elmer said
      after a period of contemplation, he developed a different understanding of
      what Carmichael was trying to say.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      began to see validity in Carmichael’s argument that the term “Black”
      had been consistently attributed with qualities of evil and negativity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Also, he realized that Carmichael was not attacking his white
      friends as racist, but rather targeting the institutionalization of racism
      and its perpetuation of inequity in the black community.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[15]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>Many blacks in Seattle interpreted Carmichael’s Black Power
      message as a call to action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
      their interpretations of how Black Power should be employed were not
      always in complete unison.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      Dixons were to pursue one strategy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      experiences of Larry Gossett can serve as an example of another option.<o:p>

      </span>Larry Gossett grew up in Seattle and though he was occasionally the
      target of racial indignities, he, like Elmer Dixon remained somewhat
      passive concerning racial issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
      midway through his college career at the University of Washington Gossett
      joined the VISTA program, and he was assigned to Central Harlem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was there that Gossett said he was confronted with realities
      that were both “shocking and enlightening.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>What shocked Gossett the most was the intense poverty and the
      “compressed humanity”, as people were crammed into rat-infested,
      run-down, and squalid apartments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      Gossett’s mind this was the epitome of racial oppression.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[16]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Though Gossett was in Harlem when Stokely Carmichael spoke in
      Seattle, he did hear Carmichael’s cohort, H. Rap Brown, speak in New
      York.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gossett said he likewise
      became exposed to the ideas of Malcolm X, who had established his
      headquarters in Harlem after his split with the Nation of Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Gossett said that these experiences revealed to him the
      possibilities of Black Power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gossett
      recalled, “When I went into VISTA I was a Negro capitalist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When I came out I was a Black Revolutionary Socialist.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn17" href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[17]</span></a><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>In September of 1967, Gossett returned from Harlem to the
      University of Washington and joined the local SNCC chapter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was through this organization that he first met Aaron Dixon, a
      University of Washington freshman, and his brother Elmer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>During the Thanksgiving weekend that fall, they, along with several
      other black university students, traveled to Los Angeles for a Black Youth
      Conference where the students were introduced to representatives of Black
      Power groups that included the Black Student Union (BSU), the United
      Slaves (US), and the Black Panther Party (BPP).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Upon their return to Seattle, Gossett decided to establish a BSU
      chapter at the University of Washington.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Gossett was elected to lead the organization and soon he and his
      cohorts, who included Aaron and high school student Elmer Dixon, began an
      effort to start BSU chapters at high schools and middle schools across
      Seattle.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn18" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[18]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>As head of the University of Washington BSU Gossett became one of
      several prominent spokesmen for Black Power in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In a <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> article he stated, “I
      believe that black people must be obsessed with thinking black.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Then they will understand the need for determining their own
      destiny.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He added that
      blacks should have the same amount of power that reflects their numbers in
      the community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“If there are
      thirty-percent black people they should be represented by thirty-percent
      of the decision-makers.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      a statement that echoed the words of Carmichael as well as a portent of an
      increasingly defiant voice emanating from Seattle’s black community,
      Gossett stated that Black Power meant, ”self determination, self-respect
      and self defense, by any means necessary.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[19]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>Michael Ross of the Seattle Legal Services Program was also
      interviewed for the article, and while he shared Gossett’s overall
      theory of Black Power, he represented yet another opinion on where it
      should be focused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ross
      believed that the Black Power should speak primarily to the city’s poor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He criticized Blacks “that have been homogenized by the
      university and who now serve as spokesmen and leaders for the black
      community because whites feel at ease with them.” He said they were not
      the ones who could develop Black Power in its truest sense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He continued that Black Power would only be legitimate when Black
      leaders come forth who communicate in the way and manner of the people who
      sit in the ghetto porches and hang out on the ghetto street corners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>For Ross, Black Power leadership should arise from the carpenters,
      welfare recipients, and unemployed.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn20" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[20]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Ross’ comments were reminiscent of previous debates regarding the
      idea of whether revolution should be led from the top or the bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His statements also revealed that Black Power could be understood
      in different contexts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
      ideas were indicative of a militant philosophy that was already being
      applied in the West Coast port city of Oakland.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It would eventually be incorporated into the Central Area of
      Seattle, through the efforts of Aaron and Elmer Dixon.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>As Seattle’s Black Power advocates debated methodology, they put
      their beliefs into practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
      of the first issues they tackled was educational integration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On March 6, 1968, the Central Area Civil Rights Council (CACRC)
      announced plans to close five schools in the Central Area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was the hope of the CACRC that these closures would force black
      students into white schools where, they believed, better educational
      opportunities existed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      Seattle Area Black Student Unions (SABSU) joined other organizations in
      criticizing the plan arguing that the CACRC did not understand the needs
      or feelings of the Central Area’s lower class residents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In line with Black Power’s call for keeping black students
      together rather than dispersing them to other institutions, the SABSU
      argued that the schools needed to be fixed, not abandoned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The CACRC ultimately backed down from their plan.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn21" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[21]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>After successfully halting the CACRC’s plan, the BSU became
      active in further protests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
      demonstration became Seattle Black Power’s symbolic Lexington and
      Concord.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On March 29, 1968,
      Larry Gossett, Aaron Dixon, and Carl Miller, a fellow BSU member, led over
      100 students in a sit-in at Franklin High School.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The protest was a complaint against the suspension of two black
      students.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The protestors
      called for more black history courses and the right to wear Afro
      hairstyles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Police were called
      to the scene and they warned the protestors that, if necessary, they would
      enter the school and physically remove them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The students dispersed but Gossett, Dixon, Miller, and another
      Franklin High School student were all arrested.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[22]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Miller were all led away for detainment until the bond could be posted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      walked up to him and told him he was wanted in the office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“…As soon as I stepped out of the classroom there were two
      detectives there who put handcuffs on me and told me I was under arrest
      for unlawful assembly, and they took me to juvenile.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn23" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[23]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As the four young men were being detained that afternoon, they all
      learned that Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Aaron Dixon said when he received the news he was sitting in a
      dark, dingy King County jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      fact that he got the news of King’s death while in that predicament
      served to harden him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aaron
      believed that King had had worthy ideas, but that over time his stance
      seemed overly compliant and too static.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Nevertheless Dixon said he respected what King was trying to do and
      his death only seemed to justify his frustration with American society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“When King was killed there was an uprising throughout…all of
      black America.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I know I said
      at that point…it’s time to turn to more violent ways of doing things
      because they killed a man of peace through violence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>We have no other alternative but to turn towards violence.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[24]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>The detainment of the Dixons and Larry Gossett is yet a further
      example of how and why Black Power, and eventually the Black Panther
      Party, could take root in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Though
      Seattle did not experience the same level of racial confrontations that
      numerous other cities did, it was obviously still a place where a black
      man could end up in jail for making a statement of conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>All three men were educated, middle-class, African Americans who
      were feeling that frustration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
      was a frustration that would compel the Dixons to move beyond the

      </span>The Seattle contingent’s attendance at Hutton’s funeral proved
      memorable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gossett remembered
      the “beauty” of what seemed like 1,000 black men and women in berets
      and leather jackets paying homage to their fallen comrade.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[26]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Elmer Dixon recalled, “We actually landed [off from the Bay
      Bridge] in a Black Panther neighborhood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>There were so many people around with leather jackets and berets
      on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We had to walk several
      blocks [to the church].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
      thought that we were in an army camp of black revolutionaries.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn27" href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[27]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The group was able to get into the church and view Hutton’s body,
      which lay in an open casket at the insistence of his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Elmer Dixon stated, “I remember following the line and seeing the
      seventeen-year old [Hutton] lying in there….I was seventeen at the time,
      and I think for me, and I know for several others, that the commitment to
      be involved in the Party was cast at that moment.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[28]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The final defining moment came that evening when Bobby Seale gave a
      speech.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aaron Dixon recalled
      that it was the “most electrifying, powerful speech that I have ever
      heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I still haven’t heard
      a speech like that.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      added that Seale’s main point was Blacks had to stand up to acts of
      violence directed toward them by whites.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn29" href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[29]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>When Seale concluded his address, Gossett, the Dixons and other
      members of their group approached the speaker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They complimented him on the power of his words and discussed the
      possibility of starting a BPP chapter in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Seale said he would consider it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Before the following week was over, Seale visited the Puget Sound
      and gave his blessing to the new branch, naming eighteen year old Aaron
      Dixon as the party captain.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

      </span>The general public of Seattle was made aware of the new Black
      Panther Party soon after Seale’s visit to the Puget Sound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Johnny Garrett, western coordinator for the Black Students Union
      was speaking at a forum being held at the University of Washington when he
      briefly mentioned that a BPP branch was being established in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He noted that the BPP’s purpose was to confront “police
      harassment,” adding that “integration is an empty notion.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn31" href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[31]</span></a><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Up to this time, the Black Student Union in Seattle had provided an
      outlet for various individuals to express their discontent and partake in
      militant activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
      observer has concluded that in performing this function, the BSU acted as
      the seedbed for further action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      writes, “…it catered to young educated African Americans in a
      protective, nurturing environment—a university campus.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Within the BSU, Gossett and the Dixons were able to create and
      implement an ideology.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn32" href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[32]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But while Gossett remained committed to the BSU, Aaron and Elmer
      Dixon’s experiences compelled them to take a separate path. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>As he recalled the choices that he and his brother made, with those
      made by Gossett, Aaron Dixon said that the BSU did a lot of positive
      things for blacks in Seattle, but the BPP took militancy to a different
      level.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“The BPP was a
      paramilitary organization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You
      had to have two weapons and you had to have two-thousand rounds of
      ammunition.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dixon added
      that with the BPP one was not just talking about working at “community
      organizing, you were talking about graduating to picking up weapons
      and…guerilla warfare and confronting the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You’re talking your life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You
      may die at any time….Not everybody was ready for that.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn33" href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[33]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>Meanwhile, Larry Gossett offers a different way of understanding
      his decision to remain with the BSU.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      notes that both Black Power organizations shared many goals, so when the
      BPP was established, he did not see it as an entirely new approach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Gossett adds that despite this sharing of goals, the groups did
      have different emphasis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      BSU’s focus was upon making changes within educational institutions by
      establishing black educational curriculum and insuring student rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On the other hand, the BPP directed its attention toward improving
      the general community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gossett
      today admits that some BPP members accused the BSU of not being
      revolutionary enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he
      argues the differences in strategy were not severe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He notes that when the BSU conducted protests at various schools,
      including the University of Washington, BPP members would often
      participate.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn34" href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[34]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>Despite the goals that they shared, there was no confusing the
      methods each organization initially chose to employ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The BSU and the BPP both advocated militancy to make their points.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But they parted ways regarding the tools of persuasion they
      employed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

          Even Martin Luther King, who along with other moderates, initially
          argued against Black Power as nihilistic and a step backward,
          eventually understood that he would have to compromise his position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This was made evident in 1967 when he published the book <i>Chaos
          or Community</i>, in which he conceded the worth of Black militancy
          and African cultural identity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>King
          admitted that the achievement of complete civil rights was but one
          goal to be achieved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pride
          in being Black he admitted was also an important part of the equation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

          July of 1966 he led a march through some of the city’s all-white
