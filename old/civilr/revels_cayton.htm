          needed to come to an end. Led by a young, African American man, named
          Revels Cayton the group entered a Seattle City Council meeting
          demanding laws that would make discrimination based on race illegal.
          The group made such a strong case that the Council decided to have a
          mass meeting to discuss the conditions facing minorities in <st1:City w:st="on">

          Seattle</st1:place>

          . Following the disruption of the Council meeting another group of
          protestors went to a local bar called the Breakers Beer Parlor where
          they demanded that the “For Whites Only” sign be removed from the
          premises. The group chose to forcibly remove the sign from this
          business, and then went on to remove others in the area.</font><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[1]</font></span></a><o:p><font size="2">

          labor and communist communities. As a key member of the Seattle
          Communist Party in the early 1930s, Revels always paid close attention
          to the labor issues on the waterfront, where black workers had been
          able to fight back white racist unions to get access to important
          longshore and maritime work. An activist on behalf of minorities and
          the working class, he worked his way through the ranks of labor union
          activities. As a strong proponent of unions, Revels had a
          distinguished activist career in the 1930s and 1940s: he served in<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

          of California State Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO);
          chairman of the California CIO’s minorities committee; a member of
          the Los Angeles Committee for Home Front Unity that oversaw the

          when Revels continued in the family tradition. Based heavily on
          extensive oral history work he did with Revels Cayton, Richard Hobbs
          wrote a dissertation and book on the lives of the Cayton family, and

          because they were Caytons. All five found different ways to live out
          their parents’ legacies. The eldest son, Horace Jr., who became a
          famous sociologist, described the family sense of obligation in this
          way: “our goals were dictated by our past; we were obligated by our
          family history to achievement in our fight for individual and racial

          Horace Jr. was not the only Cayton who saw things this way. His
          younger brother, Revels, took this family obligation to heart and
          strove to live his life in the image of his ancestors. The entire
          family looked to their past and in particular to the image of their

			<font size="2">On
          May 13, 1913 things dramatically changed for the Cayton family: Horace
          Sr. was forced shut down the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Seattle
          Republican</i>, the newspaper he published for nineteen years. The
          loss of the newspaper resulted in financial hardships for the family.
          The family had already moved into an apartment building after the loss
          of their home on Capitol Hill in 1909. The loss was because of a
          restrictive covenant that made it against the law for an African
          American family to live in that area.</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[7]</font></span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><font size="2">
          These events would drastically change the direction of Revels’ life.

          that Revels and his family would realize what it meant to be racially
          different and would drive Revels’ need to find racial equality and
          eventually would result in his participation in the Communist Party of

          their circumstances were constantly changing, depending on the success
          of whatever project Horace Sr. was working on at the time. It was in
          this state of uncertainty that Revels grew up. The family never knew
          if things were going to change the next day or if their current status
          would last. Financial problems were always an issue for the Caytons;
          therefore all of the children were forced to work at young ages.<o:p>

			<font size="2">The
          financial struggles the family faced led Revels to the waterfront in
          the summer of 1922, where at the age of fifteen he found work as a
          telephone operator on various passenger ships.</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[8]</font></span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><font size="2">
          He also worked as a waiter, working up to sixteen hours a day for very
          low wages. This type of work was very difficult, and one writer from
          the 1930s described it this way, “[the waiter] was awakened at
          five-thirty…after his own breakfast, he set up his tables and was
          ready to serve guests at seven…He then helped clean up…. Cleaned
          the silver and set up his tables for lunch…cleaned again and set up
          for dinner…and then cleaned again before being able to eat dinner
          sometime around nine-thirty…”</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[9]</font></span></a><font size="2">
          It was under these circumstances that he was first exposed to the
          powerful possibilities of worker organizing through the Colored Marine
          Employees Benevolent Association (CMEBA). The CMEBA was created by
          local African American leader, James Roston, to break the waterfront
          strike of 1922 and allow African Americans to work on the passenger
          ships coming in and out of <st1:City w:st="on">

 w:st="on">
          Seattle</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          . The Association was designed to unite black workers by having a
          central bargaining force but not to be specifically a labor union.</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[10]</font></span></a><font size="2">
          Revels’ early experience on the waterfront would help mold him into
          the role of an activist. Later in life he would be drawn to the
          waterfront again and this time it would be in a more powerful position
          when he became heavily involved in the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union
          in <st1:City w:st="on">

          his summer at sea, Revels returned to school and took up where he left
          off, playing baseball and football. Unfortunately, in 1925 he became
          incredibly ill, he was diagnosed with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">encephalitis
          lethargis</i>. The disease also known as “sleeping sickness” left

          The disease not only affected Revels physically, but psychologically
          as well. His illness ended his dream of becoming a famous baseball
          player, and ultimately lead him towards communism and his activist
          action in <st1:City

          <st1:place w:st="on">
          Seattle</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          and elsewhere. While recovering from the illness, Revels met a Wobblie
          who introduced the eighteen-year-old to the ideas of socialism. Revels
          described the encounter in this way: “by the time I got off that
          porch [where he spent hours talking politics while recovering from his
          illness]…I was a socialist. I found it…reasonable and
          sensible…that the only way that Blacks were going to get free would
          be in conjunction with the working class…”</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[12]</font></span></a><font size="2">
          Revels began to read avidly about socialism and was convinced that if
          the world would follow these ideals, there would be fewer racial
          problems and workers rights would be better. This encounter changed
          Revels’ view of society and when he returned to high school his
          attitude was very different. His new outlook made relations with
          fellow students and teachers difficult. He now was alienated from his
          peers based on political views as well as race. </font> <o:p>

			<font size="2">In
          June of 1929, Revels graduated from high school and rather than
          celebrating with his classmates he was once again drawn to the
          waterfront. He wandered through <st1:Street w:st="on">

          contemplate his future, he realized that with his poor grades, college
          was not an option. In 1932, the Depression’s deepening hold over <st1:City w:st="on">

          The Communist Party of America was formed in 1919 as an offshoot of
          the international movement. The movement became very popular in <st1:State w:st="on">
          Washington</st1:State>
          among the many workers trying to organize and make a better living in
          the growing economy of the <st1:place w:st="on">
          Pacific Northwest</st1:place>
          . Along with the worker rights, racial tension was one of the key
          issues of the Party during the 1930s. Party rhetoric revolved around
          creating a system in which all workers would be equal and therefore
          there would be no racial tensions. The Party felt that it was
          necessary to pull all workers into the Party including African
          Americans and other minorities. In 1928 the Communist International
          created the “Resolution on the Negro Question.” The resolution
          stated that racism in the <st1:country-region w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
          United States</st1:place>

          It was this statement of action that created great change in the
          American faction of the Communist Party and allowed for an increase in
          the number of African American members in the Party. An example of
          this emphasis on racial changes in the Party can be seen in the
          “Proposed Draft Resolution-8th District convention, March 17-18,
          1934.” This document presented many of the “fundamental tasks”
          facing the party. The eighth task stated that they wanted to work on
          the “development of struggles against discrimination, Jim Crowism,
          and for the rights of Negroes and Filipinos.”</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[15]</font></span></a><font size="2">

          The Communist Party had a very large impact on the life of Revels
          Cayton. It was as a member in the early 1930s that Revels began to
          become active in supporting campaigns against racial injustice not
          just in <st1:City w:st="on">

          but through solidarity with workers around the country. Like many
          African American activists of his generation, it was work on the
          Scottsboro Boys campaign through the communist International Labor
          Defense (ILD) that first inspired Revels’ Communist Party
          involvement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On March 25,

          The race of the two groups determined the verdict and the sentences.
          Eight of the nine teenagers were sentenced to death. Claiming blatant
          racism, Communist Party and the ILD stepped in to defend the
          Scottsboro boys. Revels was so captivated by the case of these boys

          Revels formally became a member of the <st1:City w:st="on">

          Seattle</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          chapter of the Communist Party sometime in early 1934. There are many
          reasons he may have become a more active member then. <st1:City w:st="on">

          Hobbs</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          states that it was because a friend said that he would have a better
          standing within the International Defense League. In letter to Richard
          Hobbs, Revels explained that “…in the beginning I was drawn to the
          Party because I believed that in a socialist system there would be no
          racism.” The Party gave Revels status and power within a tight
          community and therefore gave him important tools and direction for his
          later life. Revels also recalled to <st1:City w:st="on">
          <st1:place w:st="on">
          Hobbs</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          that “membership in the Party gave me a sense of identity, a
          direction, a purpose. It also continued [my] education…because the
          Party required members to be reading, and studying.”</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[19]</font></span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><font size="2">
          This seeking education and a sense of belonging may have been reasons
          why Revels would align himself within the Communist Party, an always
          controversial organization that would face increased scrutiny in the
          years to come. </font> <o:p>

          the Seattle City Council on the Communist Party ticket. It’s
          possible, due to the hierarchical structure of the Communist Party,
          that Revels was chosen to run and then told that he would be a
          candidate instead of choosing to pursue this position on his own. He
          is probably only one of a very small handful of African Americans who
          were chosen for such a prestigious role within the Party. But Revels
          also used the Party’s support to push a radical civil rights agenda

          Theodore Jordan, he traveled to Roslyn with Mr. and Mrs. E.M.
          Hugh-Jones. The Hugh-Jones’ were visiting from <st1:City w:st="on">
          Oxford</st1:City>
          to study labor conditions in <st1:country-region w:st="on">

          mining town of <st1:City w:st="on">
          Roslyn</st1:City>
          in <st1:place w:st="on">
          Eastern Washington</st1:place>
          . Revels was there to show the British couple the situation as a
          representative if the International Defense League. Soon after being
          spotted, he was arrested because of his reputation as a troublemaker.
          Revels described his experiences in two articles in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Voice of Action</i>. In the first article on April 17, 1934, Revels
          describes what the miners in Roslyn’s multiracial union were facing.
          In speaking about the mood, he says, “the air was electric. The
          solidarity of the miners, their wives, permeated me. The viciousness
          of their situation. Their hope and determination.”</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[24]</font></span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><font size="2">
          The second article on May 1934 has a different feel. The headline
          reads, “Cayton Describes Roslyn Jailing, Lynch Threats; Grilled by
          Police, Thugs.” The article describes how he was arrested and then
          grilled in a Cle Elum jail cell, while outside the building
          “vigilantes” waiting for his release so they could exact justice.</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[25]</font></span></a><font size="2">
          Ultimately Revels was released because of the persistence of the

          was full of activism on behalf of workers and African Americans. He
          left a mark on the city that will never be forgotten. His life had
          many ups and downs as he traveled throughout the country working with
          different labor and civil rights organizations. He was a strong leader
          of the Marine Cooks and Stewards where he helped lead the Harry
          Bridges faction of the group and the voice of the African American
          workers in the union. In 1937, he became the MCS representative to the
          Maritime Federation of the Pacific, and in July was elected Vice
          President of the MFP Bay Area Council.</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn36" href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[36]</font></span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><o:p><font size="2">

          San Francisco</st1:City>
          working with the MCS and the CIO until 1941 when he moved to <st1:City w:st="on">

          Los Angeles</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          , he worked with the CIO as an organizer and became director of the
          State CIO Minorities Commission and Vice President of the California
          State CIO Council. He returned to <st1:City w:st="on">
          San Francisco</st1:City>
          for a time until in 1945 he was asked to be the executive secretary of
          the National Negro Congress in <st1:State w:st="on">
          <st1:place
 w:st="on">
          New York</st1:place>
          </st1:State>
          . It was during this time on the NNC that Revels’ attention shifted
          back to more direct links with the Communist Party. At the same time
          that Revels was experiencing <st1:State w:st="on">

          New York</st1:place>
          </st1:State>
          and their marriage effectively ended with his move. The NNC only
          lasted a few years after Revels joined the organization, in large part
          succumbing to anti-communist pressure. While working with NNC, Revels
          met his second wife, Lee Davidson. They were married in February 1948
          and a little over a year later their son Michael Revels Cayton was
          born.</font><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn37" href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[37]</font></span></a><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"><o:p><font size="2">

          attention to the labor movement. In 1952, his connection ended with
          the Communist Party when he stopped attending meetings. In the early
          1950s, Revels’ returned to <st1:City w:st="on">

          San Francisco</st1:place>
          </st1:City>
          . During the fifties, Revels struggled to find work and it was not
          until the 1960s that he again became heavily involved in the civil
          rights struggles in <st1:State w:st="on">

          California</st1:place>

          San Francisco</st1:City>
          and was named in 1964 to the Human Rights Commission and later served

          San Francisco</st1:place>

          but continued to be a strong advocate for the rights of minorities
          after his retirement. Although he was not an active member of the
          Communist Party in his later life, he never totally disavowed the
          group, and continued to be supportive of its ideals.</font><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">

          the world of political and social activism. Throughout his life he
          took on many roles that challenged the status quo, in particular his
          work on behalf of workers on the waterfront and in other industries
          was incredible because of his race and lack of education. He made huge
