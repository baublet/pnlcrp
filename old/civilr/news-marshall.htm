			was published weekly from October 1915 to October 1919.&nbsp; Although 
			the paper purported to cover the entire Northwest, much of the 
			Northwest coverage devoted attention to events in Seattle, 
			Washington.&nbsp; Other cities in Washington— including Spokane, 
			Aberdeen, Tacoma, and Gray’s Harbor— along Vancouver and Victoria, 
			British Colombia. and some Alaskan towns all received occasional 
			coverage.&nbsp; The paper was reported a great deal of news from beyond 
			the Northwest:&nbsp; each issue included articles of national scope as 
			well as a digest of international news of interest to the Jewish 
			community.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Stories with 
			recurring coverage in the first year of the paper included articles 
			about World War I; the state of Jewish populations in Western Europe 
			and Russia; Zionism; and the place of Jewish populations in the 
			American immigrant experience.&nbsp; Confounding stereotypes of the 
			Jewish immigrant as politically radical, very little coverage was 
			devoted to articles focusing on labor movements, working class 
			issues, or detailing discrimination faced by Jews—although one story 
			discussed below is notable both for its coverage of this issue as 
			well as for its coverage of an issue of local importance.&nbsp; </span>

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Jewish 
			Voice</i>’s lack of labor movement stories may have reflected the 
			interests of the paper’s targeted audience. &nbsp;The paper focused on 
			local social and entertainment events, and national and 
			international political news.&nbsp; As a weekly, the paper was probably 
			not the sole source of news for its readers; however as WWI 
			intensified, the paper may have offered a unique and valuable 
			perspective.&nbsp; The growth of the paper, the spread of the war, and 
			the expansion of war-related coverage are all linked temporally, if 
			not commercially.&nbsp; Overall, the paper projected the image of a 
			prosperous and secure Jewish community in Seattle, and one deeply 
			engaged with events beyond the Northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Introduction</span></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
			its founding issue on October 1, 1915, the weekly <i>The Jewish 
			Voice of the Pacific Coast</i> boldly asserted that it was “the 
			pride of Seattle” and that it was “here to stay.”&nbsp; While the first 
			claim may have been true, the second is contested by failure of the 
			paper to publish any issues after October 24, 1919.&nbsp; This analysis 
			of the <i>Jewish Voice of the Pacific Coast</i> offers a critical 
			reading of the first year of the paper’s publication.&nbsp; This year, 
			contrary to later misfortunes, saw the paper grow and expand: during 
			the time period under examination, the paper changed format from a 
			pamphlet-style news bulletin, with an illustration on the front page 
			and news found inside the paper, to a more standard newspaper format 
			with several stories on the front page.&nbsp; The paper gradually focused 
			less on regional events and more on Seattle events and national and 
			international news.&nbsp; This year also saw the paper expand its 
			advertising, gradually attracting not only more community 
			businesses, but also political advertisements.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The paper 
			stressed, in the September 26, 1916, issue, that it was “the only 
			Jewish paper published and printed in Seattle.” &nbsp;The paper’s Seattle 
			focus had always been clear.&nbsp; Starting with the first issue in 
			October of 1915, the Seattle Young Men’s Hebrew Association received 
			space— eventually growing to half a page per issue—to detail its 
			events.&nbsp; In addition, each issue of the paper published reports from 
			various Seattle Jewish community groups and religious societies, as 
			well as a listing of all their upcoming meetings.&nbsp; Twice in its 
			first year the paper also printed a list of all the Yiddish books 
			bought by the Library Board, available at the Yesler branch of the 
			public library (then located in the heart of Seattle’s Jewish 
			neighborhood, the Central District).&nbsp; The society page (entitled 
			“Doings in the Social Whirl”) covered mainly Seattle parties, 
			engagements and weddings, and the travels of Seattlites; although 
			notable events from beyond Seattle, such as the wedding of the 
			daughter of Moses Alexander, the Governor of Idaho (the country’s 
			first elected Jewish governor), also garnered coverage. 
			(10/29/1915)&nbsp; Both the theater column and show listings, which 
			appeared in each issue, covered Seattle exclusively.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Seattle 
			focus was evident in advertisements as well.&nbsp; With the two 
			exceptions of an advertisement for Crescent Cream Coffee (“ask your 
			grocer”) and Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, all the advertising 
			was for Seattle businesses.&nbsp; These advertisements offered the 
			services of lawyers, an accountant, music instruction, a jeweler, a 
			mortuary, clothing and shoe shops, banks, restaurants and 
			delicatessens, and printers and stationers.&nbsp; Most of the early 
			advertisers seem to have been from within the community, although as 
			the paper grew, it attracted merchants from outside the community.&nbsp; 
			However, these advertisers may not have fully understood their 
			market, as the December 3, 1915, issue featured an advertiser 
			soliciting Christmas shoppers.&nbsp; The paper also advertised for 
			itself, not only encouraging readers to subscribe, but also selling 
			the use of its printing machines for those who needed to print in 
			non-English script, as the paper had occasional Hebrew words in it 
			and had the ability thus to print in Hebrew.&nbsp; Indeed, Nathan Krems, 
			son of <i>Jewish Voice</i> founder Sol Krems, recalled that “I 
			remember very well troops of Yiddish players coming to Seattle… and 
			they would come to [my father’s] printing plant, some I recall, in 
			the traditional actors’ garb of fur-trimmed coats and top hats… for 
			him to set up the posters, advance posters, because he had the 
			[Hebrew] type.”[1]</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The newspaper 
			issues leading up to the 1916 elections also included advertisements 
			and advocacy for both candidates and initiatives.&nbsp; Engagement with 
			electoral politics began first with local offices and drew upon 
			linkages with the Jewish community.&nbsp; Thus, the December 3, 1915, 
			issue featured a school board member, Nathan Eckstein, urging 
			community members to support a fellow board member, George Spencer, 
			in the latter’s campaign for re-election to the school board.&nbsp; In 
			Edward Brunini’s city councilman advertisement the paper had what 
			appears to be the first political advertisement in the <i>Jewish 
			Voice</i> that lacked a stated community connection. (2/2/1916)&nbsp; It 
			is possible, however, that Brunini was such a well-known member of 
			the small Seattle Jewish community that he did not need an 
			introduction to remind community members of his faithful service to 
			their interests.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The paper 
			subsequently ran many advertisements for local and state government, 
			profiles of candidates in key races, and seemed to have leanings 
			toward progressive-era reform. &nbsp;It endorsed the Republican 
			candidates for coroner and prosecuting attorney. (8/4/1916; 
			8/25/1916)&nbsp; As the 1916 Presidential election approached, the paper 
			had an advertisement for Wilson. (11/3/1916)&nbsp; The paper also 
			featured several full-page advertisements in support of Measure 24 
			in the November 1916 election. (10/6/1916; 10/13/1916; 10/27/1916)&nbsp; 
			Measure 24 was a response to the nascent prohibition movement.&nbsp; 
			Unlike dry laws, which banned all alcohol, Measure 24 was, according 
			to its advocates, “a true temperance measure,” restricting, but not 
			banning alcohol, and punishing bootleggers severely. (10/27/1916)
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The fact that 
			the paper claimed to be regional in scope, yet mainly focused on 
			Seattle, may have been a function of the relative size of the Jewish 
			community in Seattle, areas as well as the regional significance of 
			that community to smaller ones in the northwest.&nbsp; However, each 
			issue starting with the October 29, 1916, issue began with a list of 
			local Jewish organizations (covering Seattle, Tacoma, Aberdeen, 
			Everett, Vancouver BC, and Spokane, respectively) and articles 
			occasionally highlighted events in Vancouver and Victoria BC, as 
			well as in Spokane, Gray’s Harbor, and Alaska.&nbsp; These stories were 
			written by Rabbis from these areas and profiled their progress in 
			developing local Jewish communities.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As the months 
			passed &nbsp;these regional stories were reduced in favor of expanded 
			national and international coverage.&nbsp; The most notable exception, 
			discussed below, came to attention of the paper courtesy of a 
			clipping sent in by a reader, and not through its own reporting.&nbsp; 
			Although the November 5, 1915, issue and several issues thereafter 
			included an advertisement from the paper soliciting local 
			correspondents, it is unclear if &nbsp;the paper successfully recruited 
			new correspondents.&nbsp; The regional claim seemed more of a wish than 
			an enduring reality. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The paper was 
			particularly successful in its coverage of national and 
			international news. These news stories were almost certainly 
			reprints from other papers, though they are not attributed as such.&nbsp; 
			With these stories, the paper helped foster and develop a national 
			and even transnational Jewish consciousness.&nbsp; In particular, stories 
			on events that transpired within the Jewish communities on the east 
			coast, especially in New York City, connected the relatively 
			isolated Northwest Jewish community with a larger Jewish community.&nbsp; 
			Debates over how Jewish religious and cultural practices intersected 
			with American political culture were especially notable. &nbsp;For 
			instance, the paper covered the debate surrounding the Gary system 
			New York City public schools in the Bronx.&nbsp; The Gary system provided 
			for both a longer school day as well as for religious instruction 
			during school hours at an off-site location designated by parents. 
			(11/19/15)&nbsp; One article held that religious instruction as part of 
			the school day was helpful, since:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">many Jewish and 
			still a large proportion of Protestant parents are too much 
			engrossed in the pursuit of wealth and pleasure, or too selfish and 
			lazy to do more for their children than provide for their material 
			wants and their education in the secular branches of learning. 
			(11/19/1915)&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The article did 
			note the potential church-state separation issues, but argued that 
			judgment ought to be suspended until the system had been 
			implemented. (11/19/1915)&nbsp; A later article, however, offered a 
			strident critique of the Gary plan because of the mingling of church 
			and state: “the church and the home must remain the place for 
			religious instruction and activity, and the public school room must 
			be the last place in which discussions on religious distinctions 
			shall be made possible or tolerated.” (12/17/1915)&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The paper also 
			covered the lives of prominent American Jews.&nbsp; The October 29, 1915 
			issue celebrated the birthday of a prominent Jewish jurist and 
			philanthropist, Simon Wolf; the issue reprinted the congratulatory 
			telegram the paper sent to him in Washington D.C..&nbsp; The paper wrote 
			that “the whole country, Jew and Gentile, should honor [Simon 
			Wolf].”&nbsp; Likewise, the paper also allotted much space to the 
			funerals of national Jewish figures, such as that of Solomon 
			Schechter of the Jewish Theological Seminary. (10/16/1915)&nbsp; Notably, 
			the paper reported that Isadore Strauss, a Jew who perished on the
			<i>Titanic</i>, had an estate worth 3.5 million dollars. 
			(7/14/1916)&nbsp; In addition to reporting on those who were well-known, 
			the paper also ran profile pieces on less-known Jewish individuals.&nbsp; 
			For example, the first issue of the paper contained a portrait of a 
			“little-known, but extremely powerful” financier in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The <i>Jewish 
			Voice</i> also printed short fiction and non-fiction book excerpts.&nbsp; 
			The November 5, 1915, and November 12, 1915, issues of the paper 
			carried the story “The Jewish Hussar” by Max Levin.&nbsp; The January 14, 
			1916, issue carries a short story on military reinforcements written 
			by S. Roth.&nbsp; Fictional stories with war themes were quite popular, 
			perhaps since the paper dared not engage directly with the war.&nbsp; Not 
			all of these reprints were of fiction.&nbsp; For example, the first issue 
			contained a reprint from a book written by three Rabbis from Los 
			Angeles.&nbsp; The book, and this article, discussed the “Secret of 
			Happiness,” ultimately concluding that true happiness was not for 
			mortals.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While religious 
			stories were not the bulk of the paper’s coverage, stories with 
			religious themes or messages were often found in the middle pages of 
			the paper, and each issue carried a listing of the Roman calendar 
			dates of all Jewish holidays.&nbsp; Locally, the paper devoted several 
			articles to the preparation for and the celebration of congregation 
			Bikur Cholim’s 1915 Chanukah service. (11/12/1915; 11/19/1915)&nbsp; In 
			the summer of 1916, the paper devoted portions of three issues to 
			chronicling the life of Rambam (also known as Maimonides), a 
			prominent Spanish/North African Jewish thinker from the twelfth 
			century. (7/14/16; 7/21/1916; 7/28/1916) </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Thus, the paper 
			did not shy from religious content, but was sensitive of the need 
			for tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Jewish Voice </i>concluded that “there is a 
			need for religion, but not religious bigotry,” noting the troubles 
			the latter has caused in Russia. (quote in 12/101/1915; 7/25/1916)&nbsp; 
			The paper also called for a greater study of Jewish history, for 
			moderate leaders for religious communities, for lay speakers to 
			occasionally occupy the pulpits, and for all to join a congregation 
			to fulfill their duties to Judaism, and for greater religious 
			observance. (11/12/15; 11/5/1916; 11/19/1916; 6/30/1916)&nbsp; Other 
			issues also expressed displeasure over the possibility of 
			inter-marriage with non-Jews. (1/7/1916; 1/28/1916)&nbsp; The paper also 
			printed exegeses of biblical stories with clearly laid-out lessons.&nbsp; 
			For example, in the December 17, 1915, issue, an article focused on 
			the book of Exodus, extracting the message of loyalty to one’s 
			elders and heritage.&nbsp; In addition, <i>The Jewish Voice of the 
			Pacific Coast</i> was not above using religious parables to promote 
			itself, as it did in the October 29, 1915, issue.&nbsp; First telling the 
			story of Abraham’s peace-making efforts with Lot, then noting “the 
			Jewish trait of the self-sacrifice for the sake of harmony,” the 
			paper concludes that “the Jewish Voice has been organized and 
			started for the purpose of bringing harmony and peace” to the Jews 
			of the region. (10/29/1915)&nbsp; Later, the paper noted that “The Jewish 
			press can be a great factor in strengthening Judaism if it only 
			receives the proper personal and financial support that enables it 
			to accomplish this great mission.” (8/25/1916)</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the November 
			1915 issues of the paper, there was a three-part editorial on the 
			historical development of commerce, bemoaning the rise of 
			commercialism in the trades.&nbsp; The paper noted that “every line of 
			human effort today, especially in America, is conducted on lines 
			entirely at odds with those of a generation ago . . . [for example,] 
			where formerly a weaver of woolen or linen owned one loom, and 
			personally operated the same, the modern weaver runs a mill of tens 
			of thousands of spindles . . .” (11/12/1915)&nbsp; In particular, the 
			editorial argued that commercialism was a modern curse, brought on 
			by the development of money and transportation. (11/19/1916)&nbsp; The 
			results, according to the editor, were not good: “so deeply has this 
			spirit of commercialism permeated the fabric of modern society that 
			teachers, lawyers, doctors, preachers, artists . . . are all more or 
			less affected by the blight of this modern curse.” (11/24/1916)
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The November 12, 
			1915, issue also tackled the issue of keeping a Sabbath different 
			from that of the larger economy: the paper pled for Friday night 
			observance, conceding that the economic necessity made Saturday 
			observance difficult.&nbsp; Despite having noted the difficulties of 
			modern work, an editorial on September 8, 1916, concluded that work 
			was a blessing, as “it is not good to be idle.”&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Overall, 
			however, the paper did not deeply engage with labor activism.&nbsp; The 
			first mention of organized labor was an article commending the 
			generosity of New Yorker Nathan Strauss, who had provided free milk 
			to the children of striking cloak makers in New York. (7/21/1916)&nbsp; 
			Given the ethnic identity of garment-makers in New York, many of 
			those striking workers were likely Jews themselves.&nbsp; The paper, 
			however, did not engage with this dimension of labor politics.&nbsp; The 
			second mention of organized labor came in a short article that 
			summarized a speech by Samuel Gompers, President of the American 
			Federation of Labor, in which he reported that wages had increased 
			while the prices of essential goods had fallen, noting the success 
			of his efforts and those of organized workers. (4/14/1916)&nbsp; Gompers 
			was also promoting a bill that would create compulsory social 
			insurance. (4/14/1916)&nbsp; The paper neither promoted nor disparaged 
			plan, but did promote Gompers at the expense of Socialists who had 
			an alternate plan for social insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Zionism</span></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although the 
			paper had little coverage of labor activities or actions of 
			solidarity, the September 29, 1916, issue featured a call for Jews 
			to organize for their homeland.&nbsp; Thus, the organizational efforts of 
			community significance, according to <i>The</i> <i>Jewish Voice of 
			the Pacific Coast</i> were those concerning local social groups, 
			such as the Young Men’s Hebrew Society, and those concerning action 
			on behalf of Zionism. The second issue of the paper, on October 29, 
			1915 engaged directly with Zionism, reporting on the upcoming visit 
			of a prominent New York City Rabbi, Stephen Wise, who would be 
			making a tour of western cities to organize Zionist societies.&nbsp; 
			Rabbi Wise’s visit received much press: he was on the cover of the 
			November 5, 1915, and November 26, 1915 issues, and a large 
			advertisement announced his upcoming visit in the latter issue.&nbsp; The 
			paper also printed all of his Seattle speaking engagements as well 
			as information about who would entertain him while he was in town.&nbsp; 
			After Rabbi Wise’s Seattle visit, the paper reported that the Jews 
			of Seattle gave five thousand dollars for relief work in Palestine. 
			(12/3/1915)</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While the 
			majority of coverage and speakers were pro-Zionist, anti-Zionist 
			speakers also received attention.&nbsp; The visit of Rabbi Samuel Koch, 
			an anti-Zionist, was extensively covered. (12/17/1915; 12/24/1915;

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			war and the <i>Jewish Voice</i> grew together.&nbsp; The U.S. did not 
			join the war until April 6, 1917; thus, during the time period 
			covered by this analysis, the U.S. was neutral party.&nbsp; Yet the 
			country was making military preparations as early as 1915.&nbsp; The 
			paper reported on military ordnance ordered from the Puget Sound 
			Navy Yard in Bremerton, noting that the order in and of itself 
			“means very little,” but for the fact that the requesting officer 
			was a Jewish Admiral who had family ties in Seattle. (12/10/1915)&nbsp; 
			As war preparations continued, the local Jewish community, mirroring 
			the national populace, engaged in debates about the benefits of 
			preparedness.&nbsp; In a report on one such incident, Rabbi Koch is 
			quoted as definitively against such measures, characterizing them as 
			“militarism.” (4/14/1916; quote in 6/30/1916)&nbsp; U.S. official 
			neutrality as well as the conflicted national debate over entry to 
			the war may have accounted for the circumscribed way in which the 
			paper treated the war, preferring to avoid reports from the 
			battlefields altogether and focus on relief efforts.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another factor 
			that predisposed the paper toward such a muted tone was that Jews 
			were fighting on both sides of the conflict.&nbsp; For example, the 
			November 26, 1915 issue quoted the Chief Rabbi of Berlin saying that 
			“the loyalty of German Jews [is] to the fatherland in the present 
			war.” (11/26/1915) The Rabbi reported that there were Jews fighting 
			for Germany and that these Jews were doing well:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There are more 
			than 50,000 German Jews in arms, and they are met with nothing but 
			praise from their officers.&nbsp; Three hundred and fifty Jewish privates 
			in the Prussian army have been advanced to the position of officers. 
			. . In the face of such achievements the disadvantages which had 
			formerly been experienced by Jews have nearly all disappeared. 
			(11/26/1915)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">War relief also 
			was also a large topic.&nbsp; The October 29, 1915 issue noted that a 
			large donation was made to local relief fund by a Seattleite.&nbsp; War 
			relief efforts in other cities were also covered: the November 5, 
			1915, issue reported that the Jewish communities in Vancouver and 
			Victoria, BC had been cooperating with the Jewish communities in 
			Britain and Poland, respectively, to help war refugees.&nbsp; The 
			November 12, 1915, issue further reported on Jewish relief work in 
			Britain for Russian Jews.&nbsp; Following on the heels of these efforts 
			in other countries, the paper also ran articles urging American Jews 
			to do more to help Jews in the war zone, particularly since:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Jews in this 
			country are more prosperous than they have ever been before.&nbsp; There 
			have never been such opportunities for the accumulation of wealth.&nbsp; 
			We are enjoying all the luxuries of life while our brethren in the 
			war zones are suffering the bitter pangs of starvation . . . The 
			poor and the middle classes are doing their share, but there are 
			many who are blessed with great wealth who are not giving anywhere 
			near what they should. (8/11/1916)&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Perhaps to 
			facilitate this, the paper covered the way in which American Jews 
			called upon the American legal system to help mobilize support for 
			charitable donations via the creation of a National Jewish Relief 
			Day. (1/7/1916)&nbsp; A national effort may have been the preferred 
			strategy, as the paper had previously noted that the war relief 
			effort was extremely divided among Jewish communities of varying 
			nationalities: “Instead of internationality and a cosmopolitan 
			feeling, there reigns, between the relief committees themselves, 
			antagonism and hatred.&nbsp; The German Jew hates the Russian Jew; the 
			latter hates the Galician; he, the Hungarian . . .” (12/3/1915) 
			&nbsp;Thus, the paper triumphantly reported that President Wilson had 
			declared January 27, 1916, as National Jewish Relief Day. 
			(1/14/1916) &nbsp;In the weeks following that proclamation, there were 
			many appeals for aid. (1/21/1916)&nbsp; The paper also reported that the 
			Foreign Remittance Bureau, which can send money to Russia, Poland, 
			and Palestine, had reopened, for those who wish to send money 
			directly to family members in these areas. (4/21/1916)&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The November 12, 
			1915, issue is notable because that issue had the first instructions 
			on how to send mail to Russian Poland, then in German hands.&nbsp; A 
			second mail advisory was printed in the March 3, 1916, issue, 
			stating that all letters to occupied lands must now be sent via 
			Berlin.&nbsp; On April 21, 1916, the paper reported that letters bound 
			for Russia were unlikely to reach their final recipients if the 
			letters had been written in Yiddish, and that it was best to write 
			them in Russian.&nbsp; On April 28, 1916, the paper reported that the 
			Austrians were now allowing mail forwarding to occupied lands.&nbsp; The 
			front page of the June 9, 1916, issue contained a detailed 
			accounting of how a representative from the Hebrew Sheltering and 
			Immigrant Aid Society had secured the right “for both Jews and 
			non-Jews to write to their friends in America with the understanding 
			that the letters be on a certain form prepared by the [German and 
			Austrian] military.”&nbsp; Further instructions stated that in addition 
			to a simple request for funds, “it is also permitted to report the 
			death of a member of the family.&nbsp; <b>All other information is 
			strictly forbidden.</b>” (6/9/1916; emphasis in original)&nbsp; The 
			article emphasized that the delegate had persuaded military 
			authorities to deviate from their initial policy and allow 
			information about the exact date of deaths of family members so that 
			the necessary prayers could be recited for the proper amount of 
			time. (6/9/1916)&nbsp; As if to underscore the importance of 
			correspondence, an article in the June 23, 1916 issue reported the 
			arrival of mail from the war zones.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The uncertain 
			future of Jews in Eastern Europe became an increasingly important 
			issue. (12/31/1915)&nbsp; Subsequent articles note that for the duration 
			of the war, all Yiddish presses in Russia had been closed. 
			(1/7/1916)&nbsp; The February 11, 1916, issue of the paper carried an 
			editorial accusing United States news sources of silence on the 
			suffering of Russian Jews due to implicit American support for Great 
			Britain, and thus, for Britain’s ally, Russia.&nbsp; This was the only 
			negative comment about of the U.S. in the entire first year of the 
			paper’s publication.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
			November 26, 1915, issue ran a story on war suffering with a link to 
			Zionist issues.&nbsp; The story examined the destruction caused by the 
			war, noting the lands of Palestine were not immune to such 
			suffering, and that Jews in Palestine were suffering the most.&nbsp; The 
			paper reported that the American Jewish community had responded to 
			the need for aid: the Joint Distribution Committee of Funds for 
			Relief of Jewish War Sufferers sent a large shipment of medicines to 
			Palestine. (9/8/1916)&nbsp; In a front page story, the paper also argued 
			that the increased attention the war had brought to Palestine was 
			beneficial: “the war has brought Palestine more in the eyes of 
			government officials than fifty years’ agitation during peace.&nbsp; In 
			the two years of the war a new road has been completed and laid 
			down, benefiting many towns in Palestine . . .” (10/6/1916)&nbsp; </span>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This 
			passage—eerie and perhaps unsettling to contemporary 
			readers—exemplifies the optimism of the early issues of the paper.&nbsp; 
			The horrors and scope of WWI were not yet known, and America still 
			appeared as the land of unbridled opportunity in a hopefully 
			ever-increasing liberal world order.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, working 
			out the position of Jews in modern states in general and America in 
			particular would not be easy. The December 24, 1915 issue of the <i>
			Jewish Voice</i> featured an historical examination of the quality 
			of Jewish citizenship written by a Rabbi from Vancouver BC.&nbsp; The 
			story concluded that “the excellence of the citizenship of the 
			Hebrew people is universally conceded and has been a 
			well-established axiom.”</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Overall, the paper ran many articles on the place of Jews in 
			America.&nbsp; For example, the paper detailed the obligations of 
			American Jews, reporting that they must call attention to the 
			suffering of Jews in other lands: </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">

			eradication. (11/19/1915)&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Yet, not all 
			such articles were so outward-looking.&nbsp; An editorial in the December 
			31, 1915 issue of the paper proclaimed that &nbsp;“the editor of this 
			paper says emphatically that there is no such person as a hyphenated 
			Jew.”&nbsp; The editorial continued:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">. . . everywhere 
			[a Jew] is a subject of the land that gives him a home, first, and 
			after giving his loyalty to his country he bestows his sympathy to 
			his religion, and thus Jewishness comes second in consideration.&nbsp; 
			This condition of loyalty to the state first, and to Judaism 
			afterward is in accord with the Talmudic teaching of the Rabbis . . 
			. A Jew who lives in America and makes America his home is in the 
			first place an American, and a Jew afterward. (12/31/1915)&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">To underscore 
			this point, and to “illustrate the patriotism and ability of the 
			first and second generation of foreign-born Americans,” the paper 
			reprinted a poem entitled “America, I love you,” written by Archie 
			Gottler of New York City. (7/14/1916)&nbsp; The paper termed the poem “a 
			beautiful manifestation of patriotism by a little Russian Jewish 
			boy,” noting that it had been set to music and was now the most 
			popular song in New York City. (7/14/1916)&nbsp; The last two stanzas 
			read:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">America, I love

			America, I love you,<br>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, the 
			relationship between national identity and religious identity was 
			not free of tension.&nbsp; The same editorial referenced above also noted 
			that: </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The real fact is 
			that in his zeal to show and display his loyalty to the land of his 
			adoption, the Jew displays rather more patriotic feeling at the 
			expense of his religious fealty, than even the most exacting demand 
			of any country could call for. (12/31/1915)&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another article, 
			contributed by Rabbi Greenburg of Dallas, Texas asserted that in 
			order to serve one’s country, religious loyalty ought to occupy a 
			place of primacy: “the better Jews we are, the better Americans we 
			are capable of being . . . He can serve his country best who serves 
			his God best, and he serves his God best who remains true to the 
			ideals of Moses and the prophets.” (2/4/1916)&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In attempting to 
			find some balance between the privileging of religious or shared 
			national identities, the same Rabbi from Texas proffered an 
			understanding of a separate religious sphere, but a shared American 
			life in all other aspects: “the separateness of the Jew can only be 
			spoken of from the religious standpoint.&nbsp; In every other respect, 
			whether economic, social, financial, or political” the Rabbi deemed 
			the Jewish people identical to others. (1/7/1916)</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More 
			broadly, the paper also ran laudatory stories about the abilities of 
			Jews worldwide.&nbsp; The December 3, 1915, issue featured a story 
			entitled “Jews of Talent Numerous,” which detailed various Jewish 
			luminaries in science, literature, and government.&nbsp; The same themes 
			were revisited in later stories on the intelligence of the Jewish 
			people (12/17/1915), on “How Jews Contribute to Civilization” 
			(8/4/1916), and on the specific contributions that Jews have made to 
			medicine. (8/25/1916)&nbsp; Connecting with immigration issues, the paper 
			also reported “Jewish Immigrants Superior to Others.” (12/10/1915)&nbsp; 
			Likewise, in the above-referenced story on Jewish soldiers fighting 
			in the German army in WWI, the bravery and skills of Jewish soldiers 
			were highlighted. (11/26/1915)&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Germany was not the only country to tout Jews as model soldiers, 
			however.&nbsp; A May 19, 1916, obituary for William Colfen, a U.S. 
			soldier who was killed in Texas by Mexican bandits, reported that 
			his eulogy “emphasized the loyalty of the Jew to his adopted land.”&nbsp; 
			A second article also highlighted the commitment of local Jews to 
			the U.S. military, reporting that young Jewish men, including some 
			of prominent Seattle families, had enlisted in the Washington 
			National Guard for service on the Mexican border. (6/30/1916)&nbsp; 
			Continuing with the military enlistment story, the paper offered a 
			flattering portrait of Jews as soldiers, reporting that the Jewish 
			soldiers were ready for what a tour on the Mexican border would 
			bring. (7/21/1916)&nbsp; Their preparedness and the presumed battlefield 
			skills were connected with the ancient “Maccabbean spirit.”

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Jewish-American identity became more salient as Louis Brandeis began 
			to garner fame as a possible Supreme Court nominee.&nbsp; The paper ran 
			its first editorial about Brandeis on February 11, 1916, and 
			introduced him to readers who would read much more about him in the 
			coming months.&nbsp; In fact, Brandeis’s nomination received almost as 
			much coverage as debates over Zionism.&nbsp; Each step in his 
			confirmation process was celebrated as a victory, such as when his 
			name was passed out of the Senate subcommittee. (4/7/1916)&nbsp; When his 
			nomination appeared to stall after leaving the sub-committee, the 
			paper pushed for his nomination to be taken up by the wider Senate. 
			(4/14/1916;4/21/1916)&nbsp; His eventual hearings in the full Senate were 
			also a cause for much news coverage. (4/28/1916; 5/19/1916)&nbsp; 
			Brandeis’s eventual confirmation garnered a front-page headline and 
			picture. (6/2/1916)&nbsp;&nbsp; He became a community hero whose every move 
			generated new articles; the paper covered his resignation from the 
			board of a Jewish relief organization and his refusal to sit on the 
			U.S.-Mexico Border Resolution Commission. (8/4/1916; 8/11/1916)&nbsp;

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Although the bulk of the articles focused more on the place of Jews 
			in America rather than engaging directly with the question of 
			discrimination against Jews, the paper did cover the latter in a 
			limited manner.&nbsp; In addition to the Tacoma incident discussed below, 
			the paper ran two articles about the discrimination faced by the 
			Jewish board member of community organization in St. Louis, and two 
			articles about a hotel in Ohio whose advertisement stated “only 
			gentiles taken.” (5/26/1916; quote in 6/23/1916) &nbsp;With respect to 
			the Ohio hotel, the paper printed an article with the following 
			advice:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The best way to 
			do on these occasions is to avoid such places.&nbsp; When making plans 
			for a summer trip it is the wisest thing in making arrangements to 
			ascertain what places do not deserve Jewish patronage, then all 
			unpleasantness will be avoided.&nbsp; It is unwise to insist upon going 
			to places that do not want you. (7/14/1916)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Thus, 
			discrimination, while a serious issue, was portrayed as external to 
			Seattle, either on a national or regional scale.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Additionally, 
			the paper was sensitive to the plight of other parties facing 
			discrimination; while still engaging with the complex place of Jews 
			in America, the paper also noted the folly of persecuting Germans:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Alas, even our

			express his opinion against the Allies, he is immediately condemned 
			as a traitor to the American nation. (12/3/1915) &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, neither

			While the Russian immigrants received a fair amount of news 
			coverage, they were not the only Jewish immigrants making their way 
			to Seattle.&nbsp; From the simple appeal for work for mechanics, the 
			paper later ran announcements from the Hebrew Emigrant Aid Society 
			seeking work on behalf of many Jewish professionals.&nbsp; Selected 
			professions included: barber, candy-maker, merchant, watch-maker, 
			engineer, leatherworker, and lumberman. (2/4/1916)&nbsp; To give a sense 
			of the scope of immigration, the April 14th 1916 issue noted that 21 
			Jewish immigrants had arrived in Seattle “recently.”&nbsp; Overall, the
			<i>Jewish Voice</i> reported that from July of 1915 to January of 
			1916, 574 male Russian immigrants and 63 female Russian immigrants 
			had arrived in Seattle. (5/19/1916)&nbsp; In September of 1916, courtesy 
			of the Immigrant Aid Society, the paper reported that 154 immigrants 
			had arrived on the west coast in the last week. (9/15/1916)&nbsp; Not all 
			of these immigrants stayed in Seattle, however: the paper reported 
			that various aid societies provided the women—some of whom were not 
			Jewish—with onward train fare so that the women could rejoin their 
			husbands in Chicago and New York. (5/191/1916; 8/25/1916)&nbsp; </span>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
			those who did stay in Seattle, however, there was a new settlement 
			house. (8/11/1916)&nbsp; The settlement house served as a community 
			center for new immigrants, helping to “meet their bodily needs” and 
			to “make good American citizens” of them. (11/3/1916)&nbsp; The 
			settlement house supposedly allowed the community to “care for these 
			unfortunates who through no fault of theirs were forced to leave 
			their homes and country; who most of them were not financially poor 
			nor mentally destitute but who suffered from the worst form of 
			poverty a human can ever suffer from: the want of some place to call 
			home.” (11/3/1916)&nbsp; Mixing advocy with paternalistic pity, the <i>
			Jewish Voice </i>portrayed newly arrived immigrants as well-meaning 
			refugees seeking safe harbor from political and economic repression.

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In late May in 
			1916, the city of Tacoma passed a new law making it a felony to 
			bounce checks. (6/2/1916)&nbsp; In order to publicize this new law, 
			prominent Tacoma businessmen held a mock trial in which a defendant 
			was tried for bouncing checks on a local merchant. (6/2/1916)&nbsp; The
			<i>Tacoma Ledger</i> covered this incident, portraying it as moment 
			of “raillery and repartee” in the face of a stiff new law. (quote 
			from <i>Tacoma Ledger, </i>reprinted in 6/2/1916 of <i>The Jewish 
			Voice of the Pacific Coast</i>)&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, a 
			Jewish reader of the <i>Ledger</i>, W. Ehrlichman, was offended and 
			wrote to <i>The</i> <i>Jewish Voice of the Pacific Coast</i>, 
			enclosing the article and noting that the described costume, accent, 
			accessories, and last name of the mock defendant all played on 
			negative Jewish stereotypes. (6/2/1916)&nbsp; The <i>Tacoma Ledger</i> 
			faithfully reported that the mock defendant was “dressed like a 
			Hebrew gentleman . . . wearing a wig of wiry black hair and a long 
			flowing beard.” (quote from <i>Tacoma Ledger, </i>reprinted in 
			6/2/1916 of <i>The Jewish Voice of the Pacific Coast</i>)<i> The</i>
			<i>Voice </i>ran a front-page article on the incident, with the 
			headline “Brain-Rot Discovered in Tacoma: Narrow-mindedness of 
			Tacoma Bankers, Business Man, and Credit Men Disclosed.” (6/2/1916)&nbsp; 
			The paper reprinted the letter to the editor from Ehrlichman as well 
			as the article from the Tacoma newspaper. (6/2/1916)&nbsp; In his letter, 
			Ehrlichman urged a boycott of all the merchants involved in the 
			trial, concluding his letter by noting: </span></p>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Ascertain the 
			business of occupation of all who took part in the ridicule of the 
			Jew, publish their names, and let the Jew judge for himself whether 
			he should continue to deal with his enemies or his friends . . . 
			Where the Jew may have one character of the kind depicted in the 
			mock trial under the name of Goldenstein, there are thousands who 
			may be sketched as McCormacks, McDonalds, and names the like of 
			those who took part in the mock trial performance.&nbsp; The jails and 
			penitentiaries are filled with them, convicted not on general 
			principles as the Goldensteins and their like are often done away 
			with. (6/2/1916)&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The paper added 
			its own comments:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There is no Jew 
			living that could pass an insult of this nature unnoticed.&nbsp; We do 
			not have to remind the Jew what his duties in the matter are.&nbsp; The 
			Jew has learned in his past how to deal with the kind found in 
			Tacoma.&nbsp; We are not personally acquainted with the so-called 
			bankers, merchants, and credit men who have disclosed their 
			narrow-mindedness in the performance of the mock trial and we cannot 
			therefore express our opinion whether they are Jew haters or not, 
			but their act satisfies us that if this was done in jest and sport 
			only, it proves them to be a class who have no business judgment and 
			are unworthy of the titles, bankers, business men, or credit men 
			(6/2/1916)&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two 
			issues later, The <i>Jewish Voice </i>printed a letter of apology 
			from those involved in the incident. (6/16/1916)&nbsp; The letter stated 
			that there was no ill-intent in portraying the defendant in that 
			manner, that those organizing the mock trial were merely 
			thoughtless, and that they apologized for their actions. 
			(6/16/1916)&nbsp; The paper also printed a letter from a Seattle-based 
			Jewish community organization that stated “it is best to drop the 
			matter, especially on the advice of the executive committee of the 
			Anti-Defamation League.” (6/16/1916)&nbsp; Although their bid was 
			unsuccessful, this letter indicates that some Seattle Jews were 
			concerned enough to ask for help from a national Jewish defense 
			organization.&nbsp; However, with this apology, the incident died, and no 
			reports of anti-Semitic discrimination in Seattle are reported in 
			the paper during the rest of the year.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This brief 
			incident, however, brought home to the readers of the paper the 
			situation of Jews in much of the rest of the world.&nbsp; Although the 
			paper did not connect this incident to larger acts of persecution, 
			the fact that the same issue also reported on increasing prejudice 
			toward Jews in Russia, Poland, and Spain would not have gone 
			unnoticed by some readers. (6/16/1916)&nbsp; Perhaps the paper shied from 
			any direct likening of the United States with foreign countries in 
			order to avoid exacerbating the debate surrounding the place and 
			loyalty of Jews in America.&nbsp;</span></p>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Summary and 
			Conclusion </span></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			During its first year, <i>The Jewish Voice of the Pacific Coast</i> 
			came to report a unique mix of news.&nbsp; On one hand, the paper 
			remained heavily tilted in its local coverage toward that of the 
			Jewish community in Seattle.&nbsp; Seattle social events and socialites 
			were heavily featured in its society pages, and to the extent that 
			it engaged in local news reporting, this was centered on Seattle.&nbsp; 
			The paper’s early goal of covering the entire Pacific Northwest 
			region largely foundered, perhaps because it was unable to attract 
			enough regional reporters or subscribers.&nbsp; The paper was very 
			successful in attracting local business and political advertisers, 
			however. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in" align="left">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Beyond this 
			Seattle focus, the paper also acquired an increasingly national and 
			international focus.&nbsp; This was no doubt helped along by world 
			events, as the growing crisis of World War One became apparent.&nbsp; 
			Many Jews had family members in states touched by the war, and Jews 
			also served in the militaries of both the Triple Entente and the 
			Triple Alliance powers.&nbsp; As war spread, the paper stepped in to fill 
			an important niche, reporting on both the suffering of the Jewish 
			people in various lands as well as the historical success and 
			triumphs of the Jewish people.&nbsp; Although the paper did not engage 
			directly with significant labor issues, it did engage with major—and 
			enduring—debates in Jewish America: the relationship of Jews to 
			larger political and cultural trends and identities, and to Zionism.
