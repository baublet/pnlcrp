      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Throughout the United States, Chicanos organized to overcome centuries of racial discrimination, economic exploitation, and political disenfranchisement. In southern Texas, <i>la Raza Unida Party </i>activities dominated the Chicano/a Movement or <i> el Movimiento</i>.&nbsp; In Denver and Colorado,  the Crusade for Justice dominated <i>el Movimiento</i>.&nbsp; In Eastern Washington, the United Farm Workers dominated activist strategies during <i>el Movimiento</i> to such an extent that, for many people, the Union and <i>el Movimiento</i> had become synonymous, interchangeable terms.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; In Washington State, to support the Chicano/a Movement or <i>el Movimiento</i> was to support the efforts of the United Farm Workers (UFW) and vice-versa.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Many factors paved the way for the fusion of the Chicano Movement and the UFW movement. In Washington&rsquo;s Yakima Valley, justice for farm workers would be aided by federal &ldquo;war on poverty&rdquo; programs. <span class="MsoEndnoteText"><span style="font-family: Arial">President Lyndon B. Johnson signed off on the &ldquo;Economic Opportunity Act of 1964,&rdquo; effectively initiating the &ldquo;war on poverty,&rdquo; as well as the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), with the aim of alleviating the harsh conditions encountered by many populations that had been previously institutionally neglected.</span></span><a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The role of the war on poverty&rsquo;s Yakima Valley administrative entity, the Yakima Valley Council for Community (YVCCA), was to train a group of Chicana/o leaders that would organize independently of the YVCCA.&nbsp; The YVCCA thus ushered in the organizational framework of <i>el Movimiento </i>by training its leaders.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Prior to war on poverty efforts, the Catholic <i>Cursillo</i> Movement in the Valley trained individuals to take leadership positions within the community.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; The <i>Cursillo</i> movement began in the U.S. in 1957 as a Catholic ministry designed to train members in community leadership and engagement via weekend retreats. One organizer, Ricardo Garcia, noted that <i>Cursillo </i> activity existed around 1964-65, while others contend that <i>Cursillismo</i> didn&rsquo;t necessarily have an impact until 1967.&nbsp; The movement stressed unity and action to better the lives of others.&nbsp; At the peak of <i>Cursillo </i>and YVCCA action, organizers helped establish centers throughout the valley to aid many of those in need, especially farm workers.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, what really catalyzed the UFW in Washington during <i>el Movimiento</i> were the 1966 visits from California United Farm Workers Organizing Committee&rsquo;s (UFWOC) organizers. The UFWOC traveled to Washington to search for workers involved in strike activity.&nbsp; These visitors found two students engaged in leading the &quot;war on poverty:&quot; Guadalupe Gamboa and Tomas Villanueva.&nbsp; The California UFWOC visitors invited Gamboa and Villanueva to travel to Delano, California to meet Cesar Chavez.&nbsp; Gamboa and Villanueva, both students from Yakima Valley College and YVCCA organizers, drove to Delano upon invitation. As Gamboa states, &ldquo;[b]y that time both Tom&aacute;s and I were pretty fed up with the War on Poverty, because they never talked about organizing workers or forming unions or forming political power - just nothing but services&hellip;.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Villanueva and Gamboa drove all the way to Delano and met Cesar Chavez. They were surprised when they met him. As Gamboa states, &ldquo;because I had been so conditioned by living in an Anglo world, Cesar Chavez was a going to be a light-skinned, tall, debonair-looking guy in a suit, with a fancy car&hellip;.eventually Cesar Chavez showed up&mdash;this small, dark-skinned, Indian-looking guy with jet-black hair, dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt, in the middle of a bunch of workers.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; They were instantly impressed, not just by Chavez but more importantly by the power of <em>El Movimiento</em>. In California, they witnessed  a farm worker&rsquo;s movement led by a charismatic leader, who had transformed beaten-down workers  into determined strikers.&nbsp; As Gamboa reminisces, &ldquo;It was an incredible transformation, and it had a really lasting impact on me. It showed the possibilities of what could be done.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

Villanueva spearheaded additional organizing initiatives, including the establishment of a farm worker clinic in the Yakima Valley and the creation of the United Farm Worker&rsquo;s Co-operative (UFWC) in Toppenish, Washington, which was modeled after some of the entities created by the early National Farm Worker&rsquo;s Association (NFWA) in Delano.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8">[8]</a> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Another organization that would emerge during this time,in the city of Granger, was the Northwest Rural Opportunities (NRO).&nbsp; An advocacy organization funded by the state, NRO advocated for farm workers&rsquo; rights. &nbsp;Primarily organized by Mexican-Americans, the group </span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">provided the migrant community with social and health services.&nbsp; Eventually outliving the UFW Co-op, NRO would be instrumental in the founding of Radio KDNA in 1979 and would continue much of its work until the organization&rsquo;s own demise in the early 1980s. </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Mexican American Federation (MAF) also emerged in 1967, the same year as the UFW Co-op.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; This organization was one of the first groups to advocate for community development and political empowerment in the Yakima Valley. The organization established chapters in many areas throughout the state.&nbsp; As historian Jerry Garcia noted, &ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">the initial organization of the MAF was divided into five areas:&nbsp; Puget Sound, Moses Lake, Tri-Cities, Bellingham-Lynden, and the Yakima Valley.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, MAF overextended its resources and eventually dissolved, with its core restructured into the Washington State Commission on Mexican American Affairs. </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the summer of 1968, the UFWC and MAF solicited the assistance of the Washington American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in a project to provide legal aid to people of farm working background. <a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13">[13]</a>&nbsp; The report that emerged from the project underlined the conditions of working people in the valley, conditions that had forced Mexican laborers into a state of political and economic subjugation. According to the report written by Charles E. Ehlert of the Washington ACLU, &ldquo;A United States Department of Agriculture study ranked the economic status of the rural population of Yakima County among the lowest two-fifths of rural populations of all counties in the United States. &nbsp;Yakima farm workers suffer from low wages, lack of job security, poor health, high mortality and injury rates, inadequate nutrition, education and housing, discriminatory exclusion from the benefits of social welfare legislation enjoyed by others and a lack of political power.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14">[14]</a>&nbsp; At this time, thirty-nine percent of the population in Yakima county lived below the poverty level.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15">[15]</a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to lack of opportunities within the larger society, farm workers in the Yakima Valley also risked injury in performing job duties. &ldquo;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While the average life expectancy for a person in the United States is about 70 years [according to 1970 census figures], a child born to a Chicano migrant family has a life expectancy of only 38 years. Death at time of birth among the migrant newborn is 36 percent; this due solely to the lack of medical attention during birth.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Fall of 1968 was characterized by social upheaval throughout the nation and the world, with universities serving as hubs for political activity and discourse.&nbsp; Mexican-American students at the UW, few as they were, organized in ways that reverberated widely.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19">[19]</a>&nbsp; No longer satisfied with the second-class status they had experienced with their families as laborers, students began to radically reconceptualize their identities.&nbsp; They began to write their own histories from their own perspectives at the university, renaming themselves Chicanos, a Nahuatl term that expressed their self-determination, strength, and pride in their heritage.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Having already possessed an understanding of the plight of farm workers from their communities, Chicano/a students could not separate their student struggles for representation, respect, and empowerment at the university with the exploitation of farm workers in their communities.<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20">[20]</a>&nbsp; Soon after setting foot on the UW Campus, thirty-five Chicano/a students, led by Jose Correa, Antonio Salazar, Eron Maltos, Jesus Lemos, Erasmo Gamboa, and Eloy Apodaca, among many others, formed the first chapter of the United Mexican American Students (UMAS) in the Northwest.&nbsp; Modeled after the group that was founded at the University of Southern California in 1967, the UW UMAS worked to establish a Mexican-American Studies class through the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.&nbsp; This class would educated others about the history of Mexicans in the U.S., a history which before had always been told from a white male perspective.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">UMAS also engaged in a campaign to halt the sale of non-union table grapes at the University of Washington.&nbsp; Working alongside other activist organizations such as the BSU, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and members of the Associated Students of the University of Washington&rsquo;s Board of Control and the Young Socialist Alliance, the group first petitioned the dormitories to stop selling grapes in their eating facilities, quickly securing an agreement with the dorms.&nbsp; However, efforts to persuade the Husky Union Building (HUB) to cooperate proved more difficult.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21">[21]</a>&nbsp; Nevertheless, on February 17, 1969 the UW Grape Boycott Committee was victorious, as the HUB officially halted the sale of grapes. <a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"> [22]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; The victory made the University of Washington the first campus in the United States to remove grapes entirely from its eating facilities.&nbsp; At the national level, the grape boycott organized by the UFWOC achieved success in 1970, when the union finally won a contract.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Even more notable was the UMAS&rsquo; skill at building coalitions among other activist student groups, especially the Black Student Union, as evidenced by the diverse array of student groups on the boycott committee.<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23">[23]</a>&nbsp; In fact, the BSU was the reason why Chicanos were on campus in the first place.&nbsp; Through minority recruitment programs, black students went to the fields of Yakima valley to recruit ethnic Mexicans to the university.&nbsp; As the <i> University of Washington Daily</i> mentions, &ldquo;In all of these activities, UMAS has the full support of the BSU.&nbsp; The Chicanos are fully aware that most of them wouldn&rsquo;t be here if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the BSU&rsquo;s successful drive for and execution of a minority recruitment program.&nbsp; The UMAS-BSU alliance is fairly tangible.&nbsp; The BSU welcomes a UMAS representative&hellip;And three BSU officers attended the UMAS conference held in Toppenish during vacation.&nbsp; The Chicanos say, &lsquo;The two groups give each other mutual help&mdash;time, effort, funds and active support.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24">[24]</a>&nbsp; The struggle for farm worker&rsquo;s rights would eventually become a coalition effort, uniting the energies of members from nearly every racial and ethnic group.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to the grape boycott, UMAS also called a conference in Toppenish to generate support for the creation of Chicano youth groups at the high school and college levels.&nbsp; With the assistance of UW faculty, UMAS created &ldquo;La Escuelita&rdquo; in Granger in 1969, which in turn led to the creation of the <i>Calmecac</i> (Aztec school) project, a program that taught history and culture to Chicano youth in Eastern Washington. <a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25">[25]</a>&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Meanwhile, the Chicano/a student movement spread to other Washington college campuses.&nbsp; Following the lead of UW UMAS, Chicano students at Yakima Valley College formed a chapter of the Mexican American Student Association (MASA) in 1969.&nbsp; MASA, like UMAS, had its roots in southern California, originating out of East Los Angeles College. &nbsp;Chicano/a students who had made their way to Washington State University in 1967 via the High School Equivalency Program in Los Angeles had organized the first Washington state MASA chapter in Pullman.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26">[26]</a>&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="punctuation-wrap: simple; text-autospace: none"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Like 1968, 1969 was a watershed year in Chicano/a activism.&nbsp; The Chicano Youth Liberation Conference, hosted by Corky Gonzalez&rsquo;s Crusade for Justice in Denver, Colorado, laid the framework for a national youth-initiated Chicano Power Movement.&nbsp; The conference produced one of the key documents of the period, <i>El Plan Espiritual de Aztl&aacute;n</i>, which rejected the earlier stance of most Mexican-American organizations and instead advocated a separate, third political space away from both the political mainstream and the white-dominated student Left. &nbsp;The conference also urged cultural revitalization, the negation of assimilation, and Chicano/a self-determination.&nbsp; This emphasis on cultural nationalism persisted well into the late seventies, until the concept of activism <i>sin fronteras</i> (without borders) and Marxist critiques of empire led the Chicano Left to unite with the Third World cause by supporting struggles throughout Latin America.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[27]</span></a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The spread of the Chicano/a student movement resulted in the formation of many organizations that focused on education. A council of students organized a conference at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where activist Chicanos formulated &ldquo;El Plan de Santa Barbara.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[28]</span></a>&nbsp; This plan laid the framework for a master plan related to curriculum, services, and access to higher education. It became a blueprint for the implementation of Chicano/a Studies and EOP programs throughout the West Coast, including the EOP at the University of Washington. &nbsp;The conference also transformed the way Chicano students organized themselves.&nbsp; The delegates decided to merge the many activist organizations under the umbrella of <i>El Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl&aacute;n</i> (The Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan) also known as MEChA.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[29]</span></a>&nbsp; MEChA soon became the primary vehicle for Chicano/a student activism on campuses throughout the United States.&nbsp; As in other struggles in the southwest, youth would play a vital role in organizing for farm worker justice.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The organization was a bastion for motivated, militant university students and youth from Seattle&rsquo;s Chicano community.&nbsp; Rogelio Riojas recalls that the Seattle chapter was a &ldquo;group of men and women that wanted to work at the community level.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[33]</span></a> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Much like the groups in Southern California, the UW Brown Berets donned their distinctive headgear and brown military fatigues as a symbolic statement of their willingness to fight for their communities.&nbsp; They sought to bring attention to the war in the <i>barrios</i> against racial discrimination, poverty, and police brutality.&nbsp; Following the lead of the Black Panther Party, they also instituted breakfast programs and community clinics. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Brown Berets participated in a number of programs targeted to meet the specific needs of the local community and farm workers in general.&nbsp; According to Jesus Lemos, &ldquo;in the winter of 1970, the Seattle chapter organized a &lsquo;Harvest for Peace&rsquo; drive to gather food, clothing and money in order to make and distribute Christmas baskets to the Chicanos in the Yakima Valley who were in the most need.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[34]</span></a>&nbsp; The UW chapter also engaged in other activities such as the creation of a legal defense fund for Chicano activists and active involvement in support of UFW activities, such as the grape boycott.

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Brown Beret chapter in the Yakima Valley also emerged as a strong force agitating for an end to Chicano/a oppression in Central Washington.&nbsp; According to Lemos, &ldquo;In the early part of 1970 they organized a five-mile march to the welfare office in Yakima to protest the abuse of the Chicanos who were often ridiculed and treated with great disrespect and insensitivity by the welfare authorities.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[37]</span></a>&nbsp; Along with this activity, the Yakima Valley Brown Berets also played a supportive role in <i>La Escuelita</i> in Granger.<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[38]</span></span></a>&nbsp; It was perhaps the Brown Beret&rsquo;s participation in <i>La Escuelita</i> which led to the programs demise. &nbsp;Though a strong program, <i>La Escuelita</i> closed due to pressures from growers.&nbsp; The parish of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Church opted not to allow <i>La Escuelita</i> further use of the building. </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Yakima Valley Chapter of the Brown Berets, the first of two major chapters to emerge in Washington State, had a profound impact on the collective consciousness of people in the Valley.&nbsp; Their continued insistence that authorities treat ethnic Mexicans equally proved their greatest asset.&nbsp; Additionally, this chapter of the Brown Berets was part of the committee that invited Cesar Chavez to the lower Yakima Valley and even coordinated his security and protection while he was in the area.&nbsp; Beyond this activity, they were a visible force within the movement, providing security and defense against discrimination and violence from the authorities.&nbsp; On the other hand, their confrontational tactics put them at odds with some members of the Chicano community itself, which was not accustomed to the group&rsquo;s militancy. &nbsp;In fact, by 1970, the Yakima Valley&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Church forbade members to put flyers inside of the church building.&nbsp; Though having a strong presence, the Yakima Valley chapter of the Brown Berets had trouble maintaining consistent membership.&nbsp; It became inactive a few weeks after the march on the welfare office in Yakima.</span><a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span lang="ES" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[39]</span></a><span lang="ES" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
