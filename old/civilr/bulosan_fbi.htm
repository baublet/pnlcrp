    <p class="arial10">The FBI  files on Carlos Bulosan from the 1940s and 1950s shed light on more than just  the life of a renowned writer and labor activist. &nbsp;They also illuminate two interrelated issues:  the trajectory of Filipino American political consciousness in the era of  anti-colonial upheavals sweeping across the globe, and the ideological machinations  of U.S. authorities working to contain the spread of domestic and international  radicalism during the Cold War. </p>

        <div id="desc" style="display:none;">
          <p class="arial10">
      The U.S.  government&rsquo;s scrutiny of Filipino political activists during the Cold War is  hardly surprising. Filipino immigrants had developed a well-earned reputation  for labor militancy in Hawaii, Alaska, and the West Coast dating back to 1920s.  That a considerable number of Filipinos (both from the U.S. and the  Philippines) had volunteered for the International Brigades during the Spanish  Civil War to fight against fascist forces during the late 1930s only added to  the perception that they were organically drawn to radical politics. While this  political trait won them plaudits from progressives, it triggered a forceful  counter-offensive from business and political elites who viewed minority  political activism as a serious threat to the American social order.  </p>
    <p class="arial10">Consequently, Filipino workers were regular targets of police surveillance and  legal harassment in the 1920s and 1930s as their labor organizing efforts  gathered momentum. The key distinction between efforts aimed at suppressing  radicals during this earlier period and those carried out in the 1950s was the  locus of enforcement. Before World War Two, the monitoring of Filipino radicals  was often carried out at the local level and were typically handled by &ldquo;red  squads&rdquo; housed in municipal police departments across the country. The FBI&rsquo;s  investigation of Carlos Bulosan and other left-wing union leaders in the 1940s  and 1950s is best viewed as a continuation of a longer-term campaign to  discipline and subordinate Filipino labor in the United States.</p>
    <p class="arial10">
      Early  examples of anti-radical campaigns directed at Filipino partisans help to  contextualize the Cold War persecution of figures like Carlos Bulosan. This  phenomenon first took root in Hawaii in the mid-1920s when organizing efforts  led by charismatic labor leader Pablo Manlapit galvanized plantation workers to  fight back against exploitative conditions. Filipinos had initially been  recruited during the first two decades of the twentieth century to offset the  growing solidarity of Japanese workers on the plantations who leveraged their  large numerical majority among the plantation workforce to demand concessions  from the sugar industry. </p>
    <p class="arial10">The recruitment of Filipinos ultimately backfired as  the newcomers quickly embraced oppositional politics, launching a number of  crippling island-wide strikes in the 1920s. Filipinos&rsquo; enthusiastic embrace of  labor militancy prompted a furious backlash from plantation bosses moved  quickly to suppress Filipino labor solidarity. The sugar industry worked  closely with local law enforcement to develop a network of informants to gather  intelligence on union supporters and disrupt strike activity. Popular accounts  of labor unrest in the islands depicted Filipino unionists as communist  sympathizers and union demands were dismissed as the product of a Bolshevik  conspiracy aimed at seizing control of Hawaii&rsquo;s sugar industry. Plantation  officials aided local police and prosecutors to disrupt labor organizing. Many  Filipino organizers were arrested on trumped up charges (conspiracy, sedition  etc.) aimed at undercutting union solidarity and a number of leaders, including  Pablo Manlapit, were expelled from the islands for their &ldquo;subversive&rdquo;  activities.</p>
    <p class="arial10"> A similar pattern unfolded on the  West Coast, which witnessed an influx of Filipino immigrants in the late 1920s.  Though initially welcomed as a cheap and pliable solution to labor shortages in  the region&rsquo;s burgeoning agricultural sector, they soon gained a reputation for  political militancy. Largely ignored by mainstream unions as un-organizable,  Filipino workers found allies among the communist-affiliated unions that  launched efforts to catalyze the agricultural proletariat as part of their revolutionary  program. They also launched a number of independent ethnic labor organizations  like the Filipino Labor Union (FLU) and the Filipino Agricultural Laborers  Association (FALA) that allowed them to exercise greater autonomy over  organizing strategies. Filipino strike activity increased in frequency and  sophistication by the mid-1930s, prompting a fierce backlash from growers and  political elites who employed legal and extralegal tactics to suppress union  activism. </p>
    <p class="arial10">A loose coalition of conservative interest groups coalesced during  this period to address the growing political and social intransigence of  Filipino workers. Some groups like the American Legion and the Grange worked  closely with local law enforcement to intimidate and/or arrest labor organizers  (for violating criminal syndicalism laws, anti-picketing ordinances, etc.),  while others like the Associated Farmers utilized vigilante methods to  violently attack or expel &ldquo;red agitators&rdquo; from agricultural communities. Filipino  labor actions on the West Coast were frequently depicted in popular media  accounts as excessively radical, which in turn justified harsh crackdowns from  law enforcement or from vigilantes operating with the tacit approval of the  local political establishment. These earlier instances of labor suppression and  legal persecution serve as a useful reminder that the persecution of Filipino  activists pre-dates the anti-communist hysteria that proliferated during the  Cold War. </p>
    <p class="arial10">      The  federal government took on a more central role in rooting out radicals after  World War Two, spurred by the growing influence of the J. Edgar Hoover-led FBI  and the outsized political sway of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)  in the U.S. Congress. Conservative leaders were animated by a crusading spirit  and mobilized their ample socio-cultural resources to make Americans more aware  of the furtive communist conspiracy that had taken root in the nation&rsquo;s  institutions. These political actors derive prestige and power by declaring  their values as normative and the source of societal cohesion and depicting  alternative viewpoints as a threat to the political and cultural fabric of U.S.  society. The federalization of the anti-communist movement provided law enforcement  officials with unprecedented manpower and legal powers to pursue those whose  political beliefs were deemed suspect. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="arial10">By  the late 1940s federal officials had a new set of prosecutory tools at their  disposal to go after accused subversives. In 1947, President Truman&rsquo;s issued  Executive Order 9835, which created a &ldquo;loyalty-security program&rdquo; that barred individuals&rsquo;  accused of &ldquo;sympathetic association&rdquo; with dissident political groups from  federal employment. Filipinos activists had close ties to a number progressive  labor and civil rights organizations targeted by federal authorities. The  Internal Security Act of 1950 (aka the McCarran Act) provided another boost to  anti-communist crusaders. It required all members of the Communist Party and/or  designated subversive organizations to register with the federal government and  acquiesce to regular monitoring from the newly created Subversive Activities  Control Board. </p>
    <p class="arial10">This law had significant consequences for Filipino activists since  prosecutors could use past or present affiliation with left-wing groups to as  grounds for detention and deportation under the pretext of national security. Ernesto  Mangaoang and Chris Mensalves and a number of the ILWU members were arrested  under the McCarran Act. Mangaoang, who federal authorities named as one of the  &ldquo;86 top alien communists&rdquo; in the United States, faced deportation in a case  that was eventually heard by the U.S. Appeals Court. </p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>FBI Files as Political Texts</strong></p>
    <p class="arial10">Evaluating the FBI files on Filipino  radicals is a challenge, since much of the material was filtered through the  ideological prism of the McCarthy-era anxieties. Field operatives were tasked  with digging up evidence that could be used to prosecute left-wing activists  and those who failed to provide actionable intelligence did not last long at  the FBI. Agents had at their disposal a formidable state apparatus that was  wielded to coerce individuals into cooperating with the government and  overzealous investigators often abused this power in their pursuit of activists.  The ultra secretive nature of the FBI probes adds another layer of complexity  to this story, since we have little knowledge about the context under which  testimony was provided or whether informants were compensated for their  cooperation. Nor do we know if exculpatory material was suppressed or  downplayed if it contradicted the government&rsquo;s pursuit of suspected subversives.  Informants interviewed by the FBI were classified as being of either &ldquo;known  reliability&rdquo; or &ldquo;unknown reliability,&rdquo; the latter trading mostly in rumor and  speculation about a target&rsquo;s political views. The motivations of the various informants  referred to in these files certainly raise some immediate questions, since they  often identified someone as a &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; to escape prosecution themselves and  thus were incentivized to &ldquo;name names&rdquo; regardless of the veracity of such  accusations. Some of the individuals that provided information to the FBI are  also suspect since they stood to gain politically from ratting out alleged  communists. This would include informants affiliated with rival labor  organizations who sought to poach the membership rolls of left-wing unions,  officials from the Philippine Consulate who wanted to break up mutual-aid  networks between Filipino partisans in the United States and the Philippines,  and conservative members of the ILWU who wanted to oust the progressive  leadership bloc and seize control of the union. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investigation of Raymundo  Cabanilla followed the classic pattern of McCarthy era probe. An unidentified  informant named Mr. Cabanilla as a communist setting into motion an  investigation into his political background. By the time he came under scrutiny  from the FBI in their early 1950s he was working as a low level file clerk who  had recently been employed by federal government at the U.S. Department of  Treasury and the Federal Security Agency. Cabanilla&rsquo;s previous work as a labor  organizer for the FTA and later for the United Public Workers of America (UPW)  in the 1940s raised red flags for authorities. Both organizations were among  the 11 unions expelled by the CIO in 1949 and 1950 for failing to purge their  ranks of alleged communist members. Cabanilla, like many others facing criminal  charges cooperated with authorities hoping to save himself from jail time and  the loss of his job. He denied that he held subversive beliefs and gave  investigators the names of other labor militants who he believed were actual  communist party supporters, including fellow organizers Mamerto Ventura,  Ernesto Mangoang and Nick Manzano. One of the key pieces of evidence cited by  investigators interrogating Mr. Cabanilla was his relationship with Carlos  Bulosan. The two has worked together on a FTA strike campaign in California and  FBI agents noted that Cabanilla owned a signed copy of Bulosan&rsquo;s book <em>America is in the Heart</em>. We see this  sort of flimsy evidence was used repeatedly in the FBI files, which often  employed a circular, guilt-by-association reasoning: labeling individual A as a  subversive because he or she was an associate of individual B. Likewise  individual B came under suspicion because of their association with individual  A underscoring the self-fulfilling logic of anti-communist crusaders.</p>
    <p class="arial10"><strong>Reading Bulosan&rsquo;s File</strong> <br>
      The FBI  files on Carlos Bulosan affirm much of what we already knew about his life in  the United States and adds a few details that help to paint a fuller picture of  his political career. He was active in a number of popular front groups during  the 1930s including the California Labor School, Committee for the Protection  of the Foreign-Born, The League of American Writers, and the Civil Rights  Congress. Bulosan wrote for a number of leftist periodicals during the 1930s  and 1940s such as the <em>Daily Worker</em>, <em>New Masses</em>, and <em>Daily People&rsquo;s World.</em> He was also was a established figure in the  &ldquo;proletarian&rdquo; literary scene in California intermingling with prominent figures  like Carey McWilliams, John Fante, and Louis Adamic. His affiliations with a  handful of left-wing trade unions on the West Coast drew significant attention  from authorities who maintained close surveillance of these groups. Two of  these unions, the FTA and the ILWU, were expelled from the CIO in 1949 as part  of an effort to purge alleged communist-friendly unions from its ranks. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The files on Bulosan&rsquo;s political  activities from the 1930s to the 1950s paint a picture of someone who was quite  active in popular front circles, though concrete evidence of communist party  membership was circumstantial. His strident condemnation of U.S. military  interventions in Asia was a key focus of federal officials since it raised the  possibility that he might be detained as a national security threat. Such criticisms  were often viewed as evidence of &ldquo;disloyalty&rdquo; that could be used as grounds for  deportation. Moreover, Bulosan&rsquo;s relationship with the Chris Mensalves and  Ernesto Mangoang and the other Seattle labor figures guaranteed that he would  remain in the crosshairs of authorities since the ILWU took a vocal  anti-imperialist line on U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War. Informants  provided contradictory information about his political affiliations. A number  of witnesses from the Filipino community suggested that Bulosan was a communist,  but offered little corroboration to back up these claims simply citing his work  for progressive labor unions and his criticism of U.S. foreign policy as proof  of his subversive beliefs. The shakiness of the government&rsquo;s case is  illustrated in an anecdote recounted by an informant who described how Bulosan  had signaled his commitment to the worldwide communist movement when he used a  pencil to draw a &ldquo;large C&rdquo; on the tablecloth during a discussion about his  political aspirations. According to numerous witnesses he had frequently described  himself as the &ldquo;number 1 man&rdquo; among Filipino radicals on the West Coast and had  been appointed as the Commission Secretary of the Committee for Filipino  Rights, a short-lived CP front group established in Los Angeles in the 1940s. <br>
      While  Bulosan&rsquo;s association with various front groups in the 1930s and 1940s was well  established, agents struggled to build an open and shut legal case against him.  Informants affiliated with the Communist Party on the West Coast cast doubt on  allegations that he had been a member of the party, telling investigators that  he was unknown to them and that they had never seen him at CP meetings. Prosecutions  based on front group activity alone were difficult to win and government  attorneys&rsquo; approached such cases cautiously after suffering a series of  embarrassing legal defeats in their campaign to deport Harry Bridges another  partisan of the ILWU targeted by the FBI. <br>
      Bulosan&rsquo;s  relationship with the Huks and progressive union leaders in the Philippines attracted  significant attention from federal authorities. Intelligence officials in the  United States and the Philippines maintained a close working relationship after  World War Two and shared a common goal of preventing the spread of the left-wing  political forces in Southeast Asia. Bulosan&rsquo;s support of the Huks was no secret  and Philippine intelligence officials had discovered correspondence he had  written to Luis Taruc and Amado Hernandez, which was subsequently turned over  the U.S. authorities. In letters to the two well-known activists he expressed  his admiration for their revolutionary ideals and assured them that he was  working to marshal support for Philippine insurgents among American  progressives. In one fascinating passage, Bulosan tells Taruc that he is  working on a screenplay about the Huks with the hope that it would be made into  a Hollywood film. Bulosan&rsquo;s communication with Philippine radicals combined  with his public criticism of U.S. imperialism in Asia clearly piqued the  interest of American authorities, yet evidence of material support for the insurgents  was clearly lacking. <br>
      In typical  fashion, the FBI attempted to dig up salacious details about his personal life  that might be used to impugn his character and undermine his standing in the  community. Despite their best efforts, investigators did not turn up much juicy  gossip about his lifestyle. Agents characterized Bulosan as a chronic alcoholic  and numerous witnesses, including one of his doctors, claimed that he drank a  pint of whiskey per day and other informants told the FBI that he was unable to  write without the assistance of liquor. It is difficult to verify the claims of  alcoholism, but his drinking took a serious toll on his health and contributed  to his being admitted to the Firland Sanitarium in Seattle in 1950 for a  relapse of tuberculosis. His disintegrating physical condition was registered  in his admitting documents, which noted that Bulsoan&rsquo;s weight had dropped to 87  pounds. Whether true or not this information was of little value, since news  that prominent literary figure was also a heavy drinker was hardly remarkable. <br>
      Bulosan&rsquo;s  romantic life was another subject of inquiry for the FBI with a particular focus  on his relationships with white women. Investigators took a special interest in  his marriage to Marjorie Chubb, a working-class white woman from Los Angeles. The  FBI went so far as to interview Chubb&rsquo;s mother to see if they could find out  information about the couple&rsquo;s social networks. Agents also looked into rumors  that Bulosan had numerous affairs with white women during his activist period  including with a mysterious schoolteacher known only as &ldquo;Miss Cunningham&rdquo; who  they suspected might be affiliated with the Communist Party in Los Angeles.  Authorities had long exploited anxieties about interracial sex and marriage to  dismiss the political grievances of the Filipino community, suggesting that  their civil rights demands were a smokescreen for their supposedly real agenda of  unimpeded access to white women. <br>
      Bulosan&rsquo;s  broader social life also came under scrutiny and his name frequently appears on  inventories of individuals who attended fundraisers and political meetings in  Seattle during the early 1950s including a number of events organized to  support Filipino ILWU activists facing deportation during this period. The FBI  files make it clear that they had infiltrators among Bulosan&rsquo;s political  circles in Seattle. They provide a chilling amount of detail recounting  conversations and gossip overheard at private events along with comprehensive  lists of individuals who attended meetings or social gatherings. <br>
      Despite  their multi-year investigation into Bulosan&rsquo;s life, the FBI&rsquo;s case remained  largely circumstantial. Federal agents actually interviewed Bulosan in 1952 in  Seattle hoping to trick or coerce him into admitting that he was a subversive.  It is appears that he was prepared for the interrogation, offering evasive and  vague answers that allowed for plausible deniability regarding his past and  present political activities. As one would expect, he denied that had ever been  a member of the communist party, knowing that an affirmative answer would  likely lead to his deportation. When questioned about his support for the Huks  and left-wing unions in the Philippines, Bulosan offered an equivocal response  claiming that he supported the Huks for their guerilla efforts against the  Japanese occupation during World War Two and that he knew little of their  radical political program after the war. While this statement was clearly  untrue, agents were unable to pin down the exact nature of his relationship  with various left-wing organizations in the Philippines. In one telling  anecdote, investigators asked Bulosan why he so often took the &ldquo;communist line&rdquo;  on contemporaneous political issues like civil rights, labor advocacy, and U.S.  foreign policy, and he simply shrugged, offering no concrete answer. <br>
      Agents  ultimately closed the file on Carlos Bulosan without bringing charges against  him deciding that beyond intermittent front-group activity they did not compile  clear proof of membership in the communist party or material support of  Philippine insurgent organizations. This determination of course does not  really answer the question of whether or not Bulosan was in fact a communist.  The FBI files on Bulosan affirm what we already knew-- that he was a &ldquo;fellow  traveler&rdquo; who aligned himself with left-wing political organizations in the  United States and the Philippines. Moreover, the investigation into Filipino  partisans during the Cold War serves as a reminder of the high price that these  immigrant activists paid for challenging the status quo.</p>
