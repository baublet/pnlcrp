	      <span class="arial10">David Della grew up in a working class family in South Seattle in the 1950s

		  and 1960s. He attended Cleveland High School and the University of Washington.

		  Starting at age 16, he joined his father each summer in the Alaska canneries.

		  Though his father worked as a foreman for Alaska cannery companies, Della

		  would in time become involved in the fight to challenge company influence

		  in the cannery workers union, ILWU Local 37. In the early 1970s, he helped

		  organize the Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA) to fight racial discrimination

		  in the industry and was active in efforts to reform Local 37. He was also

		  active in the movement to save the International District. Following the

		  assassination of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes in 1981, the reformers took

		  control of Local 37. David Della  held several leadership positions

		  in the reformed Local: first as Dispatcher, then a Contract Negotiator, and

		  finally for eight years as Secretary Treasurer. When Local 37 merged with

		  the International Boatman's Union (IBU) to become Region 37 in 1987, Della

		  became a national organizer with IBU.

		  </span>
	      <p class="arial10">After working for over a decade as a union activist, Della turned toward

		    government affairs in the late 1980s. From 1989 to 1993, he served

		    as Deputy Chief of Staff for Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, and later as

		    Director of the State's Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs. From

		    1999 to 2003, he served as Community Affairs Director for the United Way

		    of King County. He was elected to the Seattle City Council in 2003, serving until 2007.</p>

		  <p class="arial10">David Della agreed to share memories of growing up in Seattle and his

		    activism in the labor and civil rights movements of the 1970s in

		    a videotaped interview conducted by Trevor Griffey and Lindsay Park on November 8,

		    2004. </p>
