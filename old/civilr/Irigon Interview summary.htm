and Meg Elston, November 23, 2004</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Summary by Meg Elston</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">***Tape 1***</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in the 
Philippines in 1947.&nbsp; Father joined regular army so he could come to the U.S.&nbsp; 
Lived at Army bases in Kansas, Germany, and ended at Ft. Lewis.&nbsp; His father 
retired there and the family of 7 settled in Tacoma. Frank was in the Army for 3 
years after HS.&nbsp; He didn’t like the discipline and started to see contradictions 
in what they were telling him and what he was seeing.&nbsp; Didn’t go to Vietnam b/c 
his duty was almost up.&nbsp; Wanted to leave the Army to follow RFK’s election and 
the anti-war movement.&nbsp; When his friend was killed in Vietnam, he thought about 
re-enlisting to avenge his death but then came to his senses.&nbsp; Instead he used 
his GI Bill to attend Tacoma Community College (’68-’69) and then Seattle 
Central (’69-’70).&nbsp; His friends from HS helped with the tough transition to 
civilian life.&nbsp; His sister was at the UW and encouraged him to enroll.&nbsp; He moved 
up there b/c Tacoma was too small.&nbsp; He came with friends to the UW.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">10:00&nbsp; &nbsp; He started seeing 
more contradictions in the US Constitution, Bill of Rights, etc. that made him 
question things.&nbsp; He remembered that the military stresses that everyone was one 
color but looking back he didn’t see it that way.&nbsp; Colored officers always 
living in poorer quality housing than whites.&nbsp; There was racism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">12:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More into the 
social aspects of life at the UW (1971).&nbsp; Anti-war participant but not a 
leader.&nbsp; Printed flyers and marched in parades etc.&nbsp; Gets involved with Asian 
Student Coalition for social reasons.&nbsp; But then he begins to see that they are 
doing important things.&nbsp; Like advocating for more ethnic studies, Asian profs.&nbsp; 
He talks a lot about his Filipino identity here.&nbsp; In order to get money for the 
ASC, they decide to run for offices in the ASUW.&nbsp; He’s elected to the board of 
control.&nbsp; The following year they put together a ticket with Latinos, blacks, 
Asians, and women and they win most of the seats.&nbsp; Some of the Greeks win as 
well but they all worked well together.&nbsp; Their common goal was to make students 
happy.&nbsp; He never thought that years later his daughter would join a sorority.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">21:34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He joined the ROTC 
to make extra money.&nbsp; He didn’t think it was a contradiction.&nbsp; He made $300 from 
ROTC and ASUW plus the money from his GI Bill.&nbsp; His housing was $90…so he was 
doing pretty well.&nbsp; He got kicked out of the ROTC b/c of anti-war protests.&nbsp; 
Most of the ROTC kids were there for the money, they weren’t the right-wing 
conservatives that he expected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">23:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kingdome protests – 
argued that it would have a negative impact on the neighborhood.&nbsp; There were 
many elderly people at risk of losing their housing.&nbsp; ASC wasn’t originally 
involved with the protests until they heard there would be a big ground-breaking 
ceremony.&nbsp; They decided they had to voice their opinion.&nbsp; They marched there 
peacefully.&nbsp; Everything was very orderly at first and then some began yelling at 
the speakers.&nbsp; The police were caught off guard b/c no one knew the protestors 
were coming. &nbsp;Someone threw mud at a plaque which started a mud fight.&nbsp; Police 
crowd control came.&nbsp; Protestors were trying to leave as a group (so as not to 
leave anyone behind).&nbsp; The next day, the protest was in the news but many facts 
were skewed.&nbsp; Frank challenged her account.&nbsp; The passive nature that he says is 
a common stereotype of Asians, often is a helpful one b/c when he takes a stand, 
people are surprised and they really listen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">37:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a lot here 
about committees to save the International District.&nbsp; Also a funny comment about 
making up committees to get things done like the “Asians for a Fair and 
Responsible Media.”&nbsp; The <i>real</i> Concerned Asians for the International 
District worked towards health care for the elderly as well as getting an Asian 
on the Kingdome Selection Committee.&nbsp; Bob Santos got the job, he was good at 
following through with things.&nbsp; He talks a little here about Selme (sp?) and 
Dimicio (sp?) Domingo.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">52:24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asian Family 
Affair.&nbsp; The ASC needed something to get their voices heard.&nbsp; This paper was a 
political mouthpiece from an Asian viewpoint.&nbsp; For 14 years, it was printed at 
the Ethnic Cultural Center at UW.&nbsp; It reached the entire Asian community each 
month.&nbsp; Sometimes the staff wrote their own letters to the editor to get people 
thinking the way they were.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EOC founded to give 
unemployed Asians a place to go.&nbsp; Model Cities wouldn’t give any funding.&nbsp; There 
were lots of problems in schools with Asian b/c they weren’t getting as much 
attention.&nbsp; It always seemed to be a “black/white” issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">7:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Money was never 
going to lower socioeconomic minorities, it always filtered to the middle 
class.&nbsp; He explains reasons why black clinics never were successful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">10:42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asians and blacks 
worked together, they had different self interests but could move beyond that to 
accomplish something.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">12:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a 
generation gap between how Asians accomplish things.&nbsp; Each generation uses 
different method, but they all have the same goal of advancement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">14:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People were 
searching for an ideology.&nbsp; Many found it in communism.&nbsp; Frank wasn’t into that 
but many of his friends were (KDP).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">20:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Committee For 
Justice, he was not involved.&nbsp; There were a lot of women on that committee.&nbsp; 
Many of these organizations had a lot of women involved b/c there was no 
discrimination.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">23:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 70s and 80s 
there was a high dropout rate from the Educational Opportunity Program.&nbsp; Board 
began making some policy changes.&nbsp; They wanted to only accept the best and 
brightest.&nbsp; Frank disagreed, said he would have never have been accepted.&nbsp; 
Students in protest asked Frank to join them protesting at Schmitz Hall.&nbsp; They 
were calling President Gerberding names.&nbsp; They ended up getting the policy 
thrown out but the students wanted to get arrested so it would make the news.&nbsp; 
So they stayed in the building and the campus police arrested them as the 
building was about to close.&nbsp; Other groups started to look to Frank as the only 
Asian who was willing to get arrested for a cause.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank ends the 
interview with a lot of insight, and what people should take away from these 
struggles.&nbsp; He explains why he’s so outspoken (there’s a bit of swearing in this 
part).</span></p>
