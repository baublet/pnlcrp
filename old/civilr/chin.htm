          <p class="arial10">		    Doug Chin grew up in Seattle in the 1940s and 1950s, attending Horace Mann
		  elementary and Garfield High School. After serving in the U.S. military in
		  the early 1960s, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he soon became
		  politically active. As a student at San Francisco State University and a
		  member of the East Bay Chinese Youth Council, Chin was involved in Asian
		  and Third World student activism in the late 1960s to advocate for minority
		  rights and ethnic studies programs. Doug Chin returned to Seattle around
		  1970, and quickly became involved in local Asian American youth movement
		  activism, particularly around the preservation of the Chinatown/ International
		  District (ID). In his work for the State Department of Health and as District
		  Coordinator for the International District in the city&rsquo;s Department
		  of Neighborhoods, he focused much of his attention on providing human services
		  to the diverse population of the ID.
		  <p class="arial10">Doug Chin is probably most widely known for his writing. With his brother
            Art, he co-wrote the first history of Chinese-Americans in Seattle, <i>Up
              Hill: The Settlement and Diffusion of the Chinese in Seattle, Washington</i> (1973). During the 1970s, he wrote regularly in Seattle&rsquo;s activist
            press, starting at <i>Asian Family Affair</i>, then <i>No
              Separate Peace</i>, and finally
            the <i>International Examiner</i>, where he wrote for a number of years. In 2001,
            Chin wrote <i>Seattle's International District: The Making
              of a Pan-Asian American Community</i>. </p>
          <p><span class="arial10">Doug Chin agreed to share memories of growing up in Seattle and his activism
            in the labor and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s in
            a videotaped interview conducted by Trevor Griffey and Brooke Clark
            on March 1, 2005. To the right are streaming-video excerpts of the
            interview, each about a minute in length.
