      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">The
      Seattle Black Panther Party was a product of local and national
      circumstances that had created a legacy of in-equality in the black
      community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once in place, the
      Seattle BPP showed both the willingness to adhere to the prerogatives of
      the parent organization as well as participate in innovating its own
      tactics and programs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      evidential focus up to now has been on the Panthers themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Another angle worthy of investigation is an analysis of how others
      saw the Panthers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What did
      whites think of the Panthers?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
      behaviors did they display because of those perceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Did Seattle’s legacy of “muted” racism make itself evident
      with regard to the Panthers?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
      answer these questions, two episodes that involved Washington State’s
      governor and Seattle’s mayor may prove helpful.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Soon
      after the aforementioned Rainier Beach High School incident occurred in
      September of 1968, Seattle’s mayor, J.D. Braman took action that was
      typical of many other white American politicians who were confronted with
      the BPP:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He would
      not let the BPP’s act pass without some type of response that would
      reassure the public that the authorities were in control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Aside from making comments that attacked the BPP, Braman
      successfully worked to have a gun law passed that would put restrictions
      upon firearms in the city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      caveat was that the law would not take effect for one year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Washington State legislature was presented with the task of
      passing its own gun bill that would become law more quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Panthers saw this as a direct attack on their organization and
      decided to lobby against the legislation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      Black Panthers had been faced with a similar situation in 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As the California state legislature was debating a bill that would
      outlaw the public display of guns by non-law enforcement officials, thirty
      Panthers from Oakland went to Sacramento with their guns and stood in
      front of the capital building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
      of the Panthers were ultimately arrested for conspiracy to disturb the
      peace.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[1]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When the Seattle Panthers heard about the proposed House Bill No.
      123, which would make it a “gross misdemeanor to exhibit firearms or
      other weapons in a manner manifesting an intent to intimidate others”,
      they too decided to make a demonstration in front of <st1:PlaceName

      to speak to state politicians.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      were joined a handful of Seattle Black Panthers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When they arrived at the capitol, several of the Seattle blacks
      went inside to speak to the Senate Ways and Means Committee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Meanwhile, a number of Panthers stood on the capitol steps,
      brandishing rifles and shotguns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside
      from voicing their displeasure over the purposed gun legislation, the
      black activists also told the politicians of the poor conditions and
      inequitable treatment being endured by Seattle’s black community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>During the meeting, Washington State Patrol officers were called
      onto the scene to deal with the armed Panthers who were waiting outside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Unlike the incident in California, the gun-toting Panthers were not
      arrested, but merely instructed to put their weapons away, which they did.<o:p>

      </span>Some viewed the visit negatively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Lt. Governor John Cherberg said, “I am unalterably opposed to
      interrupting the orderly business of the Senate to hold such meetings.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Senator Frank Atwood accused the Panthers of “[engaging] in a
      pitch that was inflammatory and served no useful purpose.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On the other hand, Senator Martin Durkan believed it was beneficial
      for the senators to see first hand the anger of the black community.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[3]</span></a><o:p>

      also came from citizens, many from across the country, who voiced their
      displeasure with the Panthers’ bravado in front of the legislative body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Two letters to Washington Governor Dan Evans are indicative of the
      overall tone of the correspondence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
      person wrote, “To me this is open and active anarchy and rebellion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      California’s governor Reagan, who approved of the arrest of the Oakland
      Panthers, Governor Evans promoted restraint during the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Evans, who, was away from the capitol at the time of the Panther
      visit, later chided Lieutenant Governor Cherberg for calling in the state
      patrol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evans likewise wrote
      to a complainant, “If the Black Panthers, or anyone else, violates the
      law here in Olympia the state will take immediate action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>However, there was no law violation by the Black Panthers and they,
      of course, have the same rights that any other citizen of the State of

      </span>Evans remained consistent with this type of response.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Several months later, after two Black Panthers had been invited to
      speak to a Bellevue High School Civics class, one citizen wrote the
      governor to complain about allowing a public school to serve as a forum
      for anti-government organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evans

      seems to me that with regard to the Panthers, as well as other groups,
      that first of all it is important that school children in particular have
      the benefit of varying points of view; and secondly, if the viewpoint of
      the Black Panthers is as bad as both you and I believe, then I am
      confident that high school students—when they see them in the flesh and
      listen to them—will have enough judgment and understanding to make the
      correct choice.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[7]</span></a>

		<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Evans
      proved himself to be an insightful politician for he seemed to understand
      that if the government was worried about the threat of the BPP, the best
      way to address that fear was to let their alternative points of view be
      aired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In California it was
      generally agreed that any time that the Black Panthers were involved in
      any confrontations with authorities their membership climbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      Evans was not the only Washington political leader to practice restraint
      when dealing with Seattle’s Black Panthers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Late in 1969, Seattle’s mayor’s position was assumed by a
      thirty-four year old Democrat Wes Uhlman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>At this time the city was consumed with an array of pressing
      concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Boeing was
      downsizing, the city’s major league baseball team, the Seattle Pilots,
      was threatening to move due to inadequate facilities, the police
      department was in the midst of a scandal, and most disconcerting of all,
      Seattle had been victimized by eighteen bombings over the previous seven
      months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the mind of
      the new mayor, any situations that involved the city’s Black Panthers
      were just one among a myriad of other concerns demanding his attention.<o:p>

      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Uhlman’s
      seeming lack of concern toward the Panthers was not shared by the federal
      government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Just months after
      taking office Uhlman recalled getting a telephone call from his chief of
      police, Frank Moore, who told the him that the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearm
      (ATF) branch of the federal Justice Department wanted to conduct a raid on
      the Black Panther Party headquarters in Seattle. According to the ATF, the
      Panthers were stockpiling illegal weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Uhlman discussed the matter with Moore and together they decided
      that they would not support such action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Today Uhlman states that their reasoning was based on the fact that
      the Seattle police had an undercover agent within the Panthers, whose
      safety would be in jeopardy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
      that agent had indicated that the weapons that the Panthers were
      accumulating were in fact legal which contradicted the ATF’s rationale
      for the raid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Moore
      relayed the news of the city’s unwillingness to support the raid to the
      ATF representative in Seattle, the agent requested a personal meeting with
      Uhlman the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
      meeting occurred, Uhlman said he was told that the Nixon Administration
      was anxious for this raid to take place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Uhlman again responded that he would not lend any support to such
      action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The agent became angry
      at Uhlman’s unwillingness to cooperate and threatened to enact the raid
      regardless of the city’s position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
      this point Uhlman said that if such a raid took place, he would instruct
      Seattle’s police department to encircle the BPP headquarters, and then
      determine who the aggressors were at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Uhlman’s insinuation was that there was a strong possibility that
      ATF agents would be arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
      hearing this, the agent left.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[8]</span></a><o:p>

      </span>However, before long the episode was leaked to the press.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      portraying him as a sympathizer of militants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      raid created a firestorm of reaction within the black community in Chicago
      and beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Four days later
      Los Angeles police attacked that city’s Panther Party headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Three police officers and three Panthers were wounded in the raid.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[11]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Uhlman made it known he wanted no part of this trend of attacks
      upon the BPP.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked by
      reporters about his decision, especially in light of the bombings that
      were plaguing Seattle, Uhlman responded that “such raids smack of
      ‘gestapo-type’ tactics….The easy-answer thinkers say we can
      eliminate the bombings by eliminating the Panthers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>We’ve been taking a lot of pressure to act precipitously, but
      we’re going to withstand the pressure and do it the right way.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Uhlman was also aware of how Huey Newton’s arrest after the 1967
      shootout with Oakland police served to increase the BPP’s membership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He guessed that the Seattle BPP probably only had a handful of
      official members at that time, but numerous other young blacks were
      enthralled by the group’s message.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Uhlman
      told a reporter, “If you give them a cause, they can make political hay
      out of it, and the kids will look on them like Robin Hoods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Then you wind up with 900 Panthers.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[12]</span></a><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">In
      the aftermath of the affair, Uhlman, like Evans, received letters from
      people all over the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
      writers attacked the mayor for his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One citizen stated, “When idiot public officials cast their lot
      with <u>proven</u> communist agitators and anti-american (sic) bastards as
      the BLACK PANTHERS then it is time to IMPEACH such public sons of

      </span>Another concerned citizen opined, “I don’t see why the federal
      agency had to ask a jerk like you whether they could stage a raid on the
      black panthers. (sic)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      organization is downright rotten, but it takes a rotten jerk to know a

      </span>And yet another respondent wrote, “Uhlman, you stupid ass, you
      are just as bad as the people, who are making such an issue of the two
      panthers who were killed in Chicago.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[15]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      the same time there were as many letters who saw Uhlman’s decision a
      stand against deconstructing the Bill of Rights. One supporter stated,
      “You have GUTS—and even more…it would appear you do support the TRUE
      American spirit and the Constitution of this country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      </span>These responses indicate that Uhlman’s decision was
      controversial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For many
      citizens who believed the turmoil of Vietnam, nuclear proliferation, and
      fire in the streets was tearing their world apart, Uhlman’s decision
      brought little comfort.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
      letters seem to ask, who would keep Seattle and America safe?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Simultaneously the letters represent a debate concerning the
      philosophy of law and order versus Constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Interestingly, among the many letters viewed, there was no clear
      consensus about whether social stability or individual liberties were more
      important.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">As
      a public official Uhlman made the decision that the Panthers represented
      no threat to the city’s safety or legal integrity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His decision argued that the Panthers were citizens, too, and
      citizens have rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      Panthers’ image and rhetoric, which alienated numerous citizens in and
      out of Seattle, certainly made Uhlman’s job in this case more difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But like Evans’ earlier reaction to the Panthers, time has

      </span>Uhlman and the Seattle Panthers did not always agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>One particular issue in which they became antagonists was
      Uhlman’s appointment of Charles Gain as Seattle’s acting police chief
      in July of 1970.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gain was from
      Oakland and the Seattle Panthers were offended by his selection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>At the time of the appointment Aaron Dixon stated that Gain’s
      appointment would incite discontent among the Seattle’s Black community
      because Gain was a “war mongrel.”<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[19]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>After the passing of nearly four decades Wes Uhlman continues to
      stand by his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He says
      that he never felt that the Seattle BPP was that militant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Perhaps it was his youth at the time that gave him that
      perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He readily admits
      that if he had been a black man in America during the 1960s, he may have
      been out in the streets protesting as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As to the claim that Seattle’s Panthers were overly armed, he
      responds that they had some guns, then with a smile he adds, and a
      typewriter, but that did not equate to a threat upon society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Uhlman says that an episode some years later cemented his view that
      he made the correct decision. In 1978, he was in the Central Area at a
      farewell gathering when he was approached by an elderly lady.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They exchanged greetings and then she thanked him for saving her
      sons’ lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Mrs.
      Dixon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Uhlman said her words

      Panther co-founder Bobby Seale recently spoke at a Party reunion held in
      Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During his talk he
      called the Seattle Panther chapter the “most dynamic and profound” of
      all of the organization’s branches.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Seale explained that the Seattle branch’s sickle-cell testing
      program was much more advanced than any of the other Party medical clinics
      from around the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      continued to answer the question by describing what the Seattle branch was
      not, and that was a set of members who disregarded the main framework of
      the national headquarters.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn21" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[21]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Seattle
      has often been cited as a place that was different when it came to
      political and social occurrences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      city’ activist past has often produced a story that has run contrary to
      the experiences of other American places.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>To a degree, the history of the Black Panther Party in Seattle fits
      this mold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Seattle Blacks
      lived among a citizenry that was more tolerant than those found in
      numerous other large cities in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But this tolerance was not universal, and because intolerance did
      exist, the BPP came to fruition in Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This brief study of the Seattle BPP suggests that branches of the
      organization could, and did, experience different circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In Seattle, the Panthers existed among a population that allowed
      for an uncomfortable coexistence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
      a consequence, the Seattle Panthers were able to pursue their militancy.
      When the chapter’s end came it was on their own terms.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote" class="MsoEndnoteReference">[22]</span></a><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Unlike Panther branches in Philadelphia, Chicago, or Los Angeles,
      there was no attempt to use the full force of a police department to wipe
      them out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And because of this
      the subjects of this story can still be found attempting to affect social
      change.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Elmer Dixon is a
      diversity consultant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
      Aaron Dixon and Leon Valentine Hobbs work together at Seattle’s Harder
      House, a transition home where wayward teenagers and young adults are
      assisted in finding stability and direction in their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>All of these men agree proudly that the militancy of their youth
      informs their current efforts to reform society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>They also believe that decisions like the one made by Mayor Uhlman
      were unlikely to occur in any other place besides Seattle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Consequently, the history of the Black Panther Party in Seattle
      offers an interpretation of the BPP that presents another way of
      understanding the Party’s existence in America.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

against self-incrimination. Two of the witnesses were officers of the Seattle
