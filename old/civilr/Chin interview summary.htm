grew up in Seattle in the 1940s and 50s in the Central Area of Seattle. He
attended Horace Mann elementary, and Washington middle school. All the schools
he attended had a significant percentage of minority students. In 1960 he went
into the army after graduating from 
<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Garfield</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">High School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. His father
was a waiter, and then ran a restaurant. All the Chinese he knew worked in the
restaurant business because they couldn't get jobs they were hired for.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>
<font face="Arial" size="2">*6:00<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span>He often wondered why Chinese were treated
like second class citizens and she said that this is <st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region></st1:place>
is for white people and everybody else is second. She encouraged him to work
hard ad he could have something better. He was in the military for three years,
and then came back to <st1:City w:st="on">Seattle</st1:City>, went to Olympic
College and the moved to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Oakland</st1:City></st1:place>.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>

class=GramE>In</span> the 1960’s, the Bay Area was a hotbed for the civil
rights and anti-war movements. He worked at a post-office and when they renewed
the GI bill, he went to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">San Francisco</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. There he became a
leader of the third-world minority movement and the fight for ethnic studies.
In 1968-69 they closed the school down for six months and demanded the development
of ethnic studies programs.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>
<font face="Arial" size="2">*11:50<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>His political interest was peaked when he lived
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Oakland</st1:City></st1:place> and
was trying to cross the bay bridge and activists were closing it down. People
were hurt by the police and he realized that just because he had served and
didn’t have to serve was that it was an unjust war and he grew compassionate.
He joined the East Bay Chinese Youth Council at UC-Berkeley and got ethnic
studies programs there.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>

years, and found that the <st1:place w:st="on">Chinatown</st1:place> needed
renovation and this was an issue he could fight for.</font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>
<font face="Arial" size="2">*18:00 <span class=GramE>The</span> only people who were
living in 
<st1:place w:st="on">Chinatown</st1:place> were older, poor people
and there was a lot of money floating around through the Model Cities programs
and other federal money.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>

Dome stadium was an issue to spotlight <st1:place w:st="on">Chinatown</st1:place>
and were worried that the International District would be taken over. While
working at DSHS, he talked about her wanted housing, social services-food
programs, counseling, health services, and which they all got. The Stadium was
built, but the city put resources and money in planning and provided overlay
zoning and helped the area remain and sustain its identity. The allocation of
equitable resources was important.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>
<font face="Arial" size="2">*29:00 People
demanding this caused the International District to not only remain but thrive
once again while they faded away on other places. In 1965, the immigration laws
changed and the Asian population in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Seattle</st1:City></st1:place>
exploded.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">*35:30 <span class=GramE>When</span> he was at DSHS,
he met other activists such as Larry Gossett, Tyree Scott, and Michael Woo and
demonstrated with them, even got arrested with them. They worked well together because
they were all in the same struggle.

an important role in protest because newspapers and television tell what is
important because they define what is considered important simply because it is

press won’t.</font></p>
