	Environmentalism became a mass movement in the United States in the decades 
	following World War II. Historians have documented the struggles of white, 
	middle and upper-class Americans to establish wilderness areas, protect 
	national parks from development, and limit the use of toxic chemicals. 
	However, the work of urban African-Americans and other minority groups to 
	improve their environments has received less attention. Residents of 
	Seattle’s racially diverse Central District in the late 1960s and early 
	1970s <i>did</i> work toward environmental protection – not for the creation 
	of distant wilderness areas, but for clean air, public transit, and parks 
	and recreation areas in the city. Central District community activists 
	clearly believed in a correlation between clean, healthy, and attractive 
	neighborhoods and a stable, prosperous society. Through their environmental 
	activism in two spheres – neighborhood improvement and transportation – 
	Central District residents worked toward realizing a better environment and 
	an ideal community. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The Central Seattle Community Council (CSCC), an alliance of smaller 
	neighborhood councils in Seattle's Central District, led these urban 
	environmental battles. The CSCC formed in 1967 from the merger of the 
	Jackson Street Community Council and the Central Area Community Council. The 
	Jackson Street council, founded in 1946, had attracted national attention 
	for its efforts to improve public health and the environment in the Asian 
	enclave known as the International District. The Central Area council, 
	formed in 1962, brought together a number of smaller community organizations 
	that represented Seattle’s predominantly African-American neighborhoods. The 
	two councils joined forces after urban blight, formerly confined to the 
	International District, spread into central Seattle. The merger combined the 
	organizational expertise of the Jackson Street group with the broad reach of 
	the Central Area council, and African-Americans made up a significant 
	portion of the membership and leadership of the group.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The newly formed council stressed community involvement and a self-help 
	approach to a variety of Central District concerns, such as housing, 
	education, and, most importantly for the purposes of this study, land use 
	and the environment. In the mid twentieth-century, African-American 
	communities around the nation were subjected to programs and policies, such 
	as urban renewal and redlining, that negatively affected the social and 
	physical landscape of their neighborhoods. The CSCC espoused “the basic 
	democratic belief in the ability of people to govern themselves,” but they 
	recognized that many neighborhood residents did not understand how to obtain 
	city services or lobby for a better urban environment. Through the council, 
	they hoped to bring disparate elements of the community together “for the 
	mutual consideration of all matters affecting the welfare of the people of 
	this district.”<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> 
	The CSCC hoped to organize and educate community members so that&nbsp; residents 
	would gain a voice in the land use, planning, and environmental decisions 
	that affected their community. Toward this end, two areas of concern 
	dominated the CSCC’s environmental agenda during the 1960s and 1970s:&nbsp; 
	neighborhood improvement and anti-freeway campaigns.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	Neighborhood Improvement</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">CSCC members believed that neighborhood improvement, which 
	included aesthetic concerns, public health, and the creation of parks and 
	recreation spaces, could combat not only urban blight, but also the social 
	problems that accompanied it. “To combat blight,” councilmember Lillian 
	Ashworth asserted, “we need aesthetics, a sense of design, or, in a simple 
	word-soul.” The group hoped that through the development of attractive 
	neighborhoods, parks, and recreational facilities, Central District 
	residents would enjoy “the good life,” just as white Seattleites did. One 
	CSCC report quoted famed architect Benjamin Thompson’s 1966 essay, “Visual 
	Squalor and Social Disorder.”&nbsp; “Environment both affects and teaches,” 
	Thompson wrote. “… It is a formative experience second only to family 
	relationships.” To the Central District community group, an attractive, 
	clean, and healthy physical environment with unpolluted air, parks, and 
	recreational spaces was central to solving the social problems of the 
	neighborhood.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	In October 1970, the CSCC formed a land use committee to deal specifically 
	with its surrounding environment. The committee was initially co-chaired by 
	Flo Ware, a well-known Central District resident who had been active in 
	civil rights causes in Seattle since the early 1950s. Members of the CSCC’s 
	Land Use Committee believed that “Planning is environmental.” Consequently, 
	they incorporated urban planning and design concerns into their 
	environmental agenda. Committee members recognized that “many forces have 
	combined to put neighborhoods in jeopardy,” but they believed that community 
	activism could shape the builtenvironment and foster a higher standard of 
	living. Seeking “an improved quality of life for area residents” through 
	physical change, the committee designated nine categories of concern. The 
	aesthetics and pollution subcommittee worked toward neighborhood 
	beautification (such as the installation of fountains and art), planting 
	street trees, and creating “green strips” – small patches of public space, 
	planted with grass or trees. It pressured developers and city officials to 
	construct new developments, such as a proposed low-income housing project, 
	that were of higher quality and more aesthetically pleasing. The 
	subcommittee also focused on ecology (which was not specifically defined), 
	air, noise, and visual pollution, and garbage and recycling services. In 
	addition, it proposed that the CSCC oppose billboards and lobby the city for 
	underground wiring. The transportation subcommittee similarly sought to 
	improve the neighborhood’s environment by installing street lighting, paving 
	alleys, and building bike paths and safer, wider sidewalks.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The council also&nbsp; believed that the quality of the surrounding environment 
	impacted the health and well being of the Central District’s younger 
	residents. As such, the CSCC made the creation of playgrounds and 
	recreational spaces a priority. “Facilities for recreation, both indoors and 
	outdoors, are of vital importance for a community,” stated one CSCC 
	publication. The recreation subcommittee worked to create gardens, parks, 
	playgrounds, pools, and neighborhood centers. The group inventoried all 
	existing recreational facilities in the district and determined what types 
	of recreational programs were available to its residents. It lobbied the 
	Seattle Parks Department for money for local projects and programs and 
	monitored park projects that were located in other, less racially diverse, 
	areas of the city. For instance, when the city proposed turning Fort Lawton, 
	an army post located in the mostly white, affluent neighborhood of Magnolia, 
	into a park, the CSCC urged its members to write the city to find out how 
	much money would be spent on the proposed park and what portion of this 
	would be taken away from Central District programs.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The CSCC’s efforts to expand recreational opportunities for young Central 
	District residents inspired the formation of at least one new community 
	organization. Concerned residents in the Harrison neighborhood approached 
	the CSCC with a request for more play areas in their neighborhood. The CSCC 
	helped them organize the Harrison Community Council and then facilitated an 
	alliance between the new group and affluent white residents of the nearby 
	Denny-Blaine neighborhood for the purposes of constructing a playground.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	In the relatively crowded Central District, recreational spaces were a 
	scarce commodity, and activists sometimes proposed unique solutions to this 
	problem. In one example, the CSCC identified a vacant, two block wide area 
	underneath Interstate 5, between Jackson and King Streets and Eighth and 
	Tenth Streets, that it believed should&nbsp; be developed for “passive and active 
	recreation.” The group proposed lighting, paving, and landscaping the space 
	for a variety of community activities, including a flea market, outdoor 
	concerts and dances, hobby shows, and roller skating. The CSCC plan was 
	challenged by the Yellow Cab Company, which wanted to utilize the area for 
	cab parking. For their part, neighboring businesses favored metered parking 
	in the space. The CSCC contested the cab company’s application, countering 
	that “Our plan would provide some greatly needed beautification and open 
	space for the neighborhood.” It justified its&nbsp; plan by maintaining that it 
	was for “the maximum benefit of the community.” The city favored the CSCC’s&nbsp; 
	proposal, but competing visions and a lack of funding hampered the plan’s 
	success, and it is unclear if any public events ever occurred under the 
	freeway.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
	However, the incident does show the creative ways in which the CSCC sought 
	to claim public space. While many city residents would not have found an 
	area below the interstate an appealing spot for community events, the lack 
	of public space in the Central District forced activists to work 
	imaginatively to discover potential gathering locations. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Central District neighborhood improvement councils that were affiliated with 
	the CSCC also undertook small projects to ensure the area’s attractiveness 
	and improve the surrounding environment. The Leschi Improvement Council, for 
	example, lobbied the city to maintain lots that were undeveloped and 
	overgrown. Central District residents worked hard to create attractive, 
	healthy spaces in their communities through clean-up campaigns as well. 
	Community activists removed six tons of trash during one clean-up day in 
	Leschi. On another occasion, the CSCC organized a “Plant-In” on an empty lot 
	belonging to the highway department. Volunteers weeded the tract and planted 
	vegetables and ornamental plants along busy Empire Way (now called Martin 
	Luther King Jr. Way). Local businesses donated seeds and equipment; once 
	harvested, the vegetables were given to low-income families.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The CSCC also supported city-wide political initiatives that promised 
	benefits for the Central District. The group endorsed the Forward Thrust 
	bond issue of 1968 in the hopes that the neighborhood would benefit from the 
	community centers, parks, low-income housing, and mass transit proposed by 
	the measure. The levy included money for a number of Central District 
	projects, such as parks, playgrounds, play fields, and construction of a 
	swimming pool at Garfield High School. Not everyone in the community 
	supported the plan, however. The <i>Afro-American Journal</i> urged its 
	readers to vote “no” on the bond issue, believing that black taxpayers would 
	be financing projects designed to benefit white neighborhoods. King County 
	residents voted on the twelve Forward Thrust bond measures separately and 
	many of the issues supported by the CSCC failed. Voters rejected the 
	low-income housing levy as well as the community center proposal. However, 
	to the delight of the CSCC, the parks and neighborhood improvement bonds 
	passed.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a> 
	By 1970, a number of Forward Thrust-funded parks and recreation projects 
	were underway in the Central District. </span></p>
	<h1 style="line-height:normal">
	<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Anti-Freeway Campaigns</span></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anti-freeway campaigns constituted the second category of 
	environmental activism undertaken by the CSCC. In cities across the nation 
	during the 1960s and&nbsp; 1970s, urban residents fought highway projects that 
	threatened to tear through their communities. Largely funded by federal 
	dollars after the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, these 
	projects usually benefited suburban commuters at the expense of in-city and 
	minority neighborhoods.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> 
	Anti-highway activists often focused on the loss of housing and the spread 
	of blight that resulted from road projects. In the Central District, 
	opposition to the projects focused not only on&nbsp; displacement of residents, 
	but on aesthetics, human health, and pollution. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Led by the CSCC, Central District residents fought two large road projects 
	in the late 1960s and early 1970s – the building of a third Lake Washington 
	bridge and the construction of the R.H. Thompson expressway. State highway 
	engineers saw the Central District as a conduit for suburban traffic to the 
	downtown business district, and they planned the proposed highways in order 
	to funnel cars from communities east of Lake Washington to downtown Seattle. 
	Central District residents argued that the roadways would cause noise and 
	air pollution, create an unsightly physical barrier that would divide the 
	neighborhood, and divert resources that could be used for public 
	transportation. Area residents owned fewer cars than the general population 
	(about thirty-nine percent of the neighborhood’s residents did not own an 
	automobile), and in their eyes, city and state officials planned to 
	sacrifice their neighborhood for the convenience of Seattle-area commuters.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The successful grassroots opposition to the Thompson expressway is a popular 
	topic in Seattle history. The route of the proposed freeway ran from the 
	northern suburbs of Bothell and Lake Forest Park, south through the white, 
	middle-class neighborhoods of Ravenna and Montlake, and culminated in a 
	massive clover leaf interchange at I-90 in the Central District. Many 
	Seattleites recall with pride the way that community activists successfully 
	halted the highway project, which would have negatively impacted the 
	Washington Park Arboretum, the shoreline of Lake Washington, and the quiet, 
	attractive neighborhoods that lay along the route. What is usually lost in 
	this story is the work of Seattle’s African-American community. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The CSCC’s arguments against the highway focused on the environmental and 
	social consequences of the roadway. According to the council , freeways 
	“seriously affect the character of our neighborhoods they pass through, in 
	ways that make urban living undesirable.” The group protested that freeways 
	brought noise and air pollution, destroyed open space, and imposed 
	artificial divisions within neighborhoods, and it lobbied the city to 
	consider mass transit options. Aesthetic concerns remained primary.&nbsp; In 
	particular, the council lobbied for an underground rail so that the 
	community would remain free from the sight of rail lines or electric bus 
	wires. The group encouraged Central District residents to attend hearings 
	and write letters to the city and state protesting the proposal.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	White anti-freeway activists viewed African-American residents of the 
	Central District as necessary allies in their struggle. Citizens Against the 
	R.H. Thompson Freeway (CARHT), a group that actively opposed the 
	construction of the highway, drew members largely from the white 
	neighborhoods that lay along the freeway’s proposed path. However, they 
	recognized that by courting Central District activists, they could maximize 
	their lobbying power. CARHT leaders expressly stated that they needed the 
	support of the Black community to fight the project, and they met with CSCC 
	leaders to ask how to involve more African-American residents in the 
	opposition campaign.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> 
	Largely due to these anti-highway activists, the R.H. Thompson freeway was 
	never built. Mayor Wes Uhlman and the city council rescinded their support 
	for the project in 1972 and a city-wide referendum killed the project later 
	that year.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	While African-American and white Seattleites united to fight the R.H. 
	Thompson expressway, CSCC activists had less support, and less success, in 
	their fight against the expansion of Interstate 90. Highway planners 
	proposed the addition of eight lanes to the interstate, which would widen 
	the roadway to twelve lanes through the Central District. The expansion 
	would also add another bridge across Lake Washington as it facilitated 
	vehicle traffic from Seattle’s eastern suburbs to the downtown shopping and 
	business district. Planners proposed removing eighty-seven blocks of the 
	neighborhood to make room for the roadway, displacing 3,000 residents in the 
	process.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The CSCC lobbied the city and state to prevent the expansion, citing the air 
	and noise pollution, the visual impact, and the “possible psychological 
	effect” of building a massive roadway through the Central District. The 
	group also urged the city to undertake “meaningful relocation programs” that 
	would assure displaced low-income African-Americans of decent housing.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
	</span>The CSCC worked to involve community members in the fight against the 
	interstate and held a number of meetings (sometimes co-sponsored by the 
	Urban League) to organize neighborhood opposition to the project.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Area activists expressed particular concern with the air pollution that 
	would result from the additional traffic. The dangers of leaded gasoline 
	were just beginning to be publicized, and studies showed that children who 
	lived near freeways or busy roads were at risk of brain and nervous system 
	damage. In 1971, CSCC president Roger Leed urged Mayor Wes Uhlman to refuse 
	to consider the highway department’s plan for I-90 until air and noise 
	pollution control studies could be completed. The group argued that the 
	project ran too close to Colman Elementary, where young children would be 
	subjected to harmful pollutants.&nbsp; The council maintained that the interstate 
	was responsible for seventy-five percent of the neighborhood’s noise and air 
	pollution and that an expansion would disproportionately affect Central 
	District residents. The American dream of auto mobility, they argued, had 
	turned into a “nightmare. The air is filled with poisons.” The CSCC wanted 
	to force transportation planners to consider human health, education, and 
	economic growth for <i>all</i> neighborhoods, rather than just the suburbs 
	and downtown.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Lobbying for clean, efficient mass transit systems was key to its campaign. 
	The group believed that America’s love affair with the automobile had 
	resulted in polluted environments and prevented the development of cleaner, 
	cheaper forms of urban transportation. It also saw a connection between 
	transportation and racial justice. As one CSCC statement read, “Up with 
	people and down, for a change, with the internal combustion engine ... Cars 
	have forced a segment of the population which cannot afford automobiles to 
	take second best in employment, health services, living facilities and 
	shopping.” The council lobbied the state legislature to repeal the 
	eighteenth amendment of Washington’s constitution, which directed all fees 
	and taxes collected on motor vehicles and gasoline toward highway 
	construction and maintenance. The group believed that the amendment 
	threatened to destroy the social and financial prosperity of central 
	Seattle, since it discouraged “cleaner and cheaper” forms of transportation. 
	The lack of mass transit in the neighborhood, according to the council, 
	relegated African-Americans to substandard jobs, housing, and health care.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Just as the CSCC supported the Forward Thrust bond measures that promised 
	parks, community centers, and housing, the group urged the passage of the 
	mass transit bond. The centerpiece of the 1968 Forward Thrust bond issue was 
	a $385,000,000 measure to fund a mass transit system that included rapid 
	rail as well as increased express and local bus service. During the planning 
	process, the Forward Thrust transit committee actively solicited involvement 
	from Central District citizens. The CSCC encouraged the Forward Thrust 
	committee to focus on clean, quiet types of mass transit, such as electric 
	buses, which reduced noise and air pollution. Ruth Brandwein, chairwoman of 
	the CSCC’s environment subcommittee, expressed optimism that “well placed 
	and well operated” public transit would help minority job seekers, students, 
	and young workers. She believed it would also prove helpful for Central 
	District residents seeking recreational opportunities, since there was no 
	direct bus route from the neighborhood to the beaches of Lake Washington. 
	Once again, aesthetic concerns took a high priority. “Citizens of the 
	Central Area, as people anywhere, do not want to see, hear, smell or walk in 
	the shadow of ugliness,” Brandwein wrote.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> 
	However, the mass transit measure was defeated decisively at the polls. 
	While the CSCC and many Central District residents identified a society 
	centered on&nbsp; the automobile as a problem, other King County voters were not 
	willing to reject their car-based lifestyles. They were, however, willing to 
	pay additional taxes for road and highway construction, and the Forward 
	Thrust highway construction measure did pass at the polls.&nbsp; </span></p>

	The aesthetics (or lack thereof) of the interstate expansion concerned the 
	CSCC. The group believed that a third bridge would “seriously damage not 
	only [Lake Washington’s] physical beauty, but its recreational value as 
	well.” The group publicized and protested the highway department’s practice 
	of buying houses in the right-of-way and then either leasing the structures 
	on a no-maintenance basis or demolishing them, leaving in place the ugly 
	ruins. For the CSCC, both practices created “pocket slums” of unsightly, 
	unsafe rental housing or, worse, ugly heaps of splintered wood and metal 
	that remained after home demolition.<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Central Area activists also linked the expansion of freeways with potential 
	social unrest. The interstate expansion threatened to destroy the historic 
	Mt. Baker neighborhood. Ruth Brandwein lamented not only the loss of the 
	attractive neighborhood, but the social costs as well. “The ridge is dotted 
	with lovely homes occupied by businessmen and professionals who happen to be 
	Negro,” she remarked. “[Mt. Baker] is the best example of an integrated 
	middle class in Seattle.” Brandwein asserted that planners designed the 
	project “without adequate consideration for human needs.” The massive 
	interchange, where the interstate connected with the Thompson expressway, 
	would have “irrevocable effects on the character of the entire community.” 
	Brandwein went on to warn that “this psychological as well as physical 
	southern barrier may very well contribute to an already potentially 
	explosive situation” in the district.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Other area activists also saw the connection between the built environment 
	and a stable society. The Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization 
	(CANDO) believed that the built environment shaped human behavior. “Ugliness 
	breeds ugliness,” one statement read. The group blasted a highway department 
	plan to beautify the interstate with landscaping as inadequate, since state 
	planners were clearly ignoring the “human effects” of running twelve lanes 
	of interstate through a neighborhood. CANDO predicted that the expansion of 
	I-90 would create “a Berlin Wall” in Seattle, one that was meant “to keep 
	Negroes in their place.” To these activists, an unattractive physical 
	barrier through their neighborhood would ruin the surrounding environment 
	and create a setting for antisocial behavior. Many neighborhood residents 
	saw the issue as another example of white oppression of the black community. 
	One African-American speaker at a hearing for the interstate expansion 
	argued there should be “no white freeway through the black community.” The
	<i>Afro-American Journal</i> was similarly explicit in its opposition toward 
	the I-90 expansion. “If suburbanites want an easier way to work,” the <i>
	Journal</i> argued, “let them return to the city, pay taxes to the city, and 
	join in trying to save the city rather than hiding in the suburbs, 
	destroying and polluting our city with freeways so that they can hold the 
	best jobs and extract the wealth of the city to the suburbs.”<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> regarded the racialization of the 
	conflict with contempt. “To make a racial issue of the traffic project takes 
	discussion out of the arena of rational debate,”&nbsp; one editorial claimed. The 
	editor argued that mitigation measures, such as landscaping projects and the 
	tunnel through Mt. Baker ridge, would render the highway “undisruptive.”<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
	Central District residents remained unconvinced that an additional eight 
	lanes of interstate through their neighborhood would not be disruptive.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Activists managed to stall the I-90 project and also succeeded in convincing 
	the Washington State Department of Transportation to design a tunnel, rather 
	than a slash through the hillside, to accommodate the highway. Ed Banks of 
	the CSCC considered this a partial victory, since the community forced the 
	engineers and government officials to “realize the human values” associated 
	with the project. The third bridge, however, was eventually built. Thanks to 
	new technology, the expanded interstate did not destroy the prosperous Mt. 
	Baker neighborhood, as activists had feared. When construction finally began 
	in 1983, new tunnel boring machines burrowed through Mt. Baker ridge without 
	damaging the homes above. The highway department built play fields over the 
	Mercer Island portion of the interstate to lessen noise pollution and remove 
	the visual impact of the project for the upscale, white suburban community. 
	Similar efforts were not undertaken in Central Seattle, and the expanded 
	interstate still makes a significant visual and environmental impact on the 
	largely minority neighborhood it bisects.<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Urban residents and reformers struggled to better their surrounding 
	environment throughout the twentieth-century. Progressive Era reformers 
	worked for garbage collection, clean water supplies, and playgrounds, while 
	late twentieth-century environmental justice advocates fought against toxic 
	waste sites and for public health initiatives in their communities. Urban 
	environmentalism has largely been left out of the story historians tell 
	about post-war environmentalism, however. Environmental activism in the 
	1960s and 1970s was not the sole domain of white, middle and upper -class 
	activists who sought to protect wilderness areas. Cities, too, were sites of 
	many environmental battles, and today’s Central District reflects the 
	environmental concerns of&nbsp; activists in the 1960s and 1970s. These types of 
	struggles continue: despite community opposition, a proposed light rail line 
	is currently planned to run above ground through the Central District, 
	though it will operate underground and out of sight throughout much of the 
	rest of Seattle. More research is needed to understand the extent of urban 
	environmental activism in the mid-twentieth century, but this subject must 
	be given a place in the story of post-war environmentalism.</span></p>
