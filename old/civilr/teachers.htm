The lesson uses the basic &ldquo;town meeting&rdquo; format to help students understand the issue of segregation in schools and one form of protest local civil rights groups used to create change in their community. Also, the lesson is designed to expose students to the various dimensions involved in one particular form of protest, a boycott. The point of the exercise is not the vote that takes place at the end, but the critical thinking and communication that happen along the way. Created by Stacey Joyce, M.Ed. </p>
