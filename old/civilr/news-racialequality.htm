		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		quotation above summarizes the basic philosophy behind the creation of 
		the <i>Racial Equality Bulletin</i>. Published by the Christian Friends 
		for Racial Equality (CFRE), the paper asserted that brotherhood, or the 
		coming together of people, was integral to the fight against racism. The 
		articles and the community events organized by the <i>Racial Equality 
		Bulletin</i> reveal that the CFRE believed that racism and 
		discrimination could be overcome through love, education, and a better 
		understanding of other cultures. The paper not only delivered news on 
		the national civil rights movement, but also served as a social events 
		resource, helping to coordinate numerous activities and events, from 
		square dancing to educational forums on the Jewish faith and interracial 
		picnics. It also strove to be inclusive by recognizing the 
		accomplishments of people from various ethnic backgrounds from around 
		the Seattle community. Central to all of this was the influence of the 
		Christian faith, which was pervasive throughout the paper. In fact, the 
		opening line of the <i>Bulletin's</i> statement of purpose referred to 
		the religious motivation behind the group's involvement in the fight for 
		racial equality: </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">“As Christian 
		Friends for Racial Equality, we seek to apply the Golden Rule.&nbsp; We stand 
		for the equality of opportunity for all men of all races to exercise all 
		rights and privileges, guaranteed by our Constitution and Bill of 
		Rights.&nbsp; We protest by peaceful means the denial of those rights and 
		privileges, and strive to develop a public conscience against racial and 
		religious discrimination.&nbsp; We endeavor to promote understanding by 
		social acquaintance…”</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CFRE 
		was formed in May of 1942 in the Seattle area. The original group 
		consisted of seventeen people from seven different Christian 
		denominations and the Jewish faith. The group was multi-racial and was 
		primarily made up of women, who made up two-thirds of the membership and 
		three-fourths of the officers
		<a name="_ednref1" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn1">
		<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
		<span style="vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>. There were 
		four editors of the newspaper – three women and one man – as well as 
		volunteers to do secretarial work in the office. A yearly subscription 
		to the paper was $1.00. The membership of the CFRE was 500 strong in 
		1947, suggesting that the paper had a sizeable readership and was 
		financially secure
		<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2">
		<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
		<span style="vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CFRE 
		meetings were held monthly in different churches around Seattle, 
		including the Episcopal, Baptist, Congregational, and Unitarian. The <i>
		Bulletin</i> advertised the date, time, and location of these meetings. 
		The meetings were used as educational opportunities, as well as to 
		discuss the issues of the group and the newspaper. For example, during a 
		meeting in February of 1952, a CFRE member gave a presentation on the 
		topic of Hiroshima. Other meetings discussed local issues like Native 
		American rights and discrimination. At the November 18, 1952 meeting, 
		the CFRE hosted Dr. Viola Garfield of the University of Washington for a 
		lecture titled, “The Northwest Indian Today.” During the group’s January 
		1953 meeting, Mr. Robert Jones discussed “The Citizen’s Responsibility 
		for Anti-Discrimination Legislation.” At one unique meeting in November 
		of 1951, the CFRE discussed racist behavior in the community and trained 
		&nbsp;members how to respond to racially offensive statements. The training 
		session was advertised in the previous month's edition of the <i>Racial 
		Equality Bulletin</i>:&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">“”Wops never could 
		learn decent manners.”&nbsp; Have you ever been present when remarks like 
		this have been made in public…have you thought that you really should 
		say something in rebuttal, but have not known what to say…?&nbsp; Well, at 
		our November meeting we’re going to dig into this problem of what to say 
		and how to say it, and why it’s important to say something.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The group felt the 
		training was so necessary that they even role-played some of the various 
		situations, and the topic was apparently popular enough that they 
		extended the discussion and training into the following month.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">One of the primary 
		goals of the <i>Racial Equality Bulletin</i> was to educate readers 
		about events occurring in other parts of the nation and around the 
		world. For example, the <i>Bulletin</i> frequently reported on 
		segregation in the American South. In September 1951, an article 
		headlined “Separate But Not So Equal” discussed the inequalities in 
		segregated Southern public schools, citing the inadequate funding 
		provided for African-American schools. In the November 1951 issue, the 
		paper highlighted the racist immigration policies of Australia, where 
		customs officials would not allow a Japanese-American to pass into the 
		country. The <i>Bulletin</i> concentrated on the successes of the civil 
		rights movement far more than on the struggles. For example, the 
		December 1951 issue contained &nbsp;seven articles that could be categorized 
		as positive achievements of the movement, including one about 
		universities that had pledged to desegregate and another about a city 
		mayor who had banned restrictive housing covenants. Meanwhile, in the 
		same issue only two articles discussed negative aspects of the ongoing 
		struggle. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Christian 
		Friends for Racial Equality also educated members about other cultures, 
		and used the <i>Racial Equality Bulletin</i> to publicize its cultural 
		events. For example, in October of 1951 the <i>Bulletin</i> encouraged 
		readers to join a Mr. and Mrs. Hayes in their home to discuss Jewish 
		holidays that were going to be observed during that month. And on August 
		19, 1952, the <i>Bulletin</i> informed readers that the CFRE was hosting 
		a cooking demonstration of Korean and Scandinavian food at its monthly 
		meeting.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the spirit of 
		brotherhood, the <i>Bulletin</i> documented the struggles and celebrated 
		the victories of many ethnic groups, including African-Americans, 
		Japanese, and Native-Americans. An article headlined “The Real Problem” 
		in the December 1951 issue examined the poverty of residents of the 
		Navaho Reservation. Meanwhile, the October 1952 issue celebrated the 
		passage of a &quot;Nisei Rights Bill&quot; for the Japanese-American community:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">“It should be a 
		matter of congratulation…that there has been enacted into law a Nisei 
		Civil Service Workers’ Bill which restores rights lost during the time 
		of arbitrary removal of Nisei people from the home and jobs during 
		wartime.”&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Another example of 
		the paper's support for the Japanese-American community, and for people 
		of color in general, was when it recognized the achievement of a second 
		generation Japanese girl who won the Oregon state beauty contest (July, 
		1952).&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along 
		with education, one of the primary beliefs of the Christian Friends for 
		Racial Equality was that social interaction was a necessary part of 
		breaking down racial boundaries. The staff of the CFRE proudly 
		differentiated itself from other civil rights organizations because of 
		its emphasis on organizing social gatherings, including picnics, square 
		dancing, and nights out to the theatre. In the December 1952 issue of 
		the <i>Bulletin</i>, the article “Do We Overlap” discussed this point. 
		The article was written in response to questions from community members 
		about how the various civil rights organizations differed from each 
		other. The article named the different organizations and explained the 
		importance of each. After emphasizing the similarities in the 
		organizations’ struggles for racial equality, the <i>Bulletin</i> argued 
		that the Christian Friends for Racial Equality was different from other 
		groups on the basis of its belief in social networking to bring about 
		brotherhood:</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in; margin-right: .5in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&quot;[The CFRE's] social 
		program is based on the idea that, tho you can legislate against 
		discrimination, you can cure prejudice only by social acquaintance, by 
		the actual friendly association of people in congenial gatherings.”&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of 
		course, the idea of brotherhood through social interaction could only be 
		realized if the people reading the <i>Bulletin</i> and attending the 
		social activities put on by the CFRE were of varying ethnicities. There 
		is reason to believe that this was the case. First of all, the CFRE was 
		founded by an interracial group of Caucasian and African-American women<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>. 
		The fact that CFRE meetings were held in different churches throughout 
		the Seattle area also signifies an effort to get people of varying 
		faiths and ethnic backgrounds involved. One way the <i>Racial Equality 
		Bulletin</i> helped to accomplish this was by having ministers from 
		different churches in the Seattle area contribute an article every month 
		about the connection between Christianity and promoting racial 
		equality.&nbsp; In the December 1951 issue, Reverend Harold Jensen, the 
		Caucasian pastor of First Baptist Church, was the contributing minister. 
		He discussed his application of religion to race relations by describing 
		a Christmas when he was visiting an African-American church and was 
		startled to see a Black Christ-Child. “It startled me and humbled me,&quot; 
		Jenson wrote. &quot;I knew it was right and that I really should not have 
		been startled at all.” He went on to discuss how the brotherhood of man 
		and Christ’s love for all bound him to believe that the fight for racial 
		equality was a fight that Christians should be a part of.&nbsp; Surely, much 
		of Reverend Jenson's congregation was white and one would suspect that 
		there was plenty of support for the CFRE. There is evidence to suggest 
		the involvement of African-Americans in the group, as well. Many of the 
		articles in the <i>Racial Equality Bulletin</i> referred to racism and 
		discrimination against African-Americans. For example, all of the school 
		segregation articles from 1951-1953 dealt with either the success of new 
		African American enrollment or new information about a university that 
		was still refusing to admit African-Americans. One can assume 
		African-Americans were very involved with the publication of the <i>
		Racial Equality Bulletin</i> and the membership of the CFRE.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>
		Racial Equality Bulletin</i> was an important instrument in the 
		Christian Friends for Racial Equality's struggle for civil rights in the 
		early 1950s. The <i>Bulletin</i> attacked racism by publishing articles 
		on segregation, discrimination in housing and in the workplace, and the 
		racial problems in South Africa and elsewhere around the nation and 
		world. It promoted community uplift by publishing articles on the 
		importance of ethnic cultural preservation and on the achievements of 
		the civil rights movement in various communities of color. The <i>
		Bulletin</i> also helped promote the CFRE's vision of Christian 
		brotherhood across ethnic and racial groups by publicizing interracial 
		social events and educational programs sponsored by the CFRE. The paper 
		and the CFRE were representative of their era – a time when civil rights 
		unrest and non-violent, Christian-based social justice movements were 
		starting to emerge on a national scale. To end, a quote from the 
		Reverend Wm. McDowell:</span></p>
