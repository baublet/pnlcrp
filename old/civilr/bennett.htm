      <p class="arial10">Ramona Bennett is a longtime and prominent leader from the Puyallup tribe. A pioneering activist on behalf of Indian fishing rights, she co-founded the Survival of American Indians Association in 1964, an organization that helped bring local &ldquo;fish-ins&rdquo; to national prominence.&nbsp; </p>
		    <p class="arial10">Bennett was elected to the Puyallup Tribal Council in 1968, and elected as Tribal Chairwoman in 1971, a position she held until 1978.&nbsp; In addition to her fishing rights advocacy, she participated in the takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Building in Washington, DC in 1972 and helped take over Tacoma&rsquo;s Cushman Hospital in 1976.&nbsp; She also opened doors for women activists by actively fighting attempts during the 1970s to exclude her from National Tribal Chairmen&rsquo;s Conferences.</p>
		    <p class="arial10">Much of Bennett&rsquo;s leadership has focused on issues of social welfare. She began her social service work in Seattle&rsquo;s American Indian Women&rsquo;s Service League in the 1950s.&nbsp; In 1972, she co-founded the Local Indian Child Welfare Act Committee.&nbsp; Through the Committee, she developed a model for childhood and family service in Washington State that she used to help her co-author and secure a national Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978.&nbsp; In the 1980s, she served as an administrator for the Wa-He-Lut Indian School in Olympia before going on to co-found Rainbow Youth and Family Services, a Tacoma-based non-profit that she still directs today.</p>
		    <p class="arial10">Bennett earned an MA in Education from the University of Puget Sound in 1981, and received an honorary Doctorate of Public Affairs from the school in 2000.&nbsp; In 2003, the Native Action Network awarded her with its Enduring Spirit Award.&nbsp; </p>
