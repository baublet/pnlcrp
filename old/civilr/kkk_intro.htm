	  <span class="arial10 style2">This special section of the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project documents the  history of  Washington State's 1920s chapter of the most infamous white supremacist organization in American history, the  Ku Klux Klan (KKK).</span></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal "><span class="arial10 style2"><span class="arial10  style2">The Washington State Klan during the 1920s was part of the second of three waves of KKK activity in America. </span></span><span class="arial10 style2">The second KKK was founded in 1915 and gained significant membership immediately following World War I.  Though short-lived, it was a powerful anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, anti-radical, white supremacist organization that promoted &quot;100 percent  Americanism.&quot;&nbsp; The second KKK claimed over 4 million members across the country; briefly dominated state legislatures of Colorado, Indiana, and Oregon; and in 1924 shaped presidential politics and  helped pressure politicians to pass the most severe immigration restriction in the history of the United States. Following immigration restriction and a series of leadership scandals, the second KKK collapsed and was largely moribund by 1928. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal "><span class="arial10 style2">The second KKK was a mass movement that invoked the memory of and built upon the first KKK, which was a terrorist organization founded by white supremacists in the U.S. South.  The first KKK's violent &quot;night riding&quot;-- in which hooded vigilantes used lynchings, whippings, and torture to intimidate recently freed slaves and their white allies -- played a crucial role in the disenfranchisement of African Americans at the end of the  Civil War in the 1860s and 1870s and laid a foundation for the rise of Jim Crow segregation in the 1890s and 1900s.&nbsp; The second KKK also helped train some of the leaders who later formed the third KKK,  a mainly Southern organization that rose up in the decades after World War II to murder and terrorize people in African-American communities, particularly civil rights movement activists. Klan members'    hoods,  white robes, and  burning crosses  made them icons of American white supremacy and  terrorism, and their legacy haunts us to this day. </span></p>
    <p class="arial10  style2">The Washington  State KKK during the 1920s was founded by organizers from Oregon, which had one of the strongest  Klan chapters in the country at the time. The  State Klan organized a series of massive public rallies in 1923 and 1924 that ranged from 20,000 to 70,000 people. While they publicly disavowed violence, Klan members participated in violent intimidation campaigns against  labor activists and Japanese farmers in Yakima Valley and probably elsewhere. They put forward a ballot initiative in 1924 to prohibit Catholic schools that voters soundly defeated. And though most of the State's Klan chapters collapsed in rancor following the defeat of their anti-private school initiative, a strong presence persisted in Whatcom and Skagit Counties throughout the 1930s.  In the 1930s, some prominent leaders in the region's KKK went on to become involved in the facist Silver Legion, or &quot;Silvershirts,&quot; a national movement that, while   small, was quite active in Washington State. And there is evidence that the Klan in Bellingham helped pioneer intimidation practices that paved the way for anti-communist witch-hunts in the 1940s. </p>
