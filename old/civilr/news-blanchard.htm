			<font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Calling itself &quot;the 
			Voice of Jewish Washington,&quot; <i>The Jewish Transcript</i> has served 
			the Jewish community for more than eighty years. This essay explores 
			the very early history of the weekly newspaper. Today the newspaper 
			publishes under the name: <i>
			Jewish Transcript News.</i> 
			</span></font></p>
			<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">* * * </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">On March 6th, 
			1924, Herman Horowitz printed the first edition of <i>The Jewish 
			Transcript</i>. Horowitz dedicated the newspaper to the local Jewish 
			population, as evidenced by its subtitle: “A Weekly Newspaper 
			Devoted to the Jewry of the Pacific Northwest” on each edition.&nbsp; 
			Throughout its first two years in publication the newspaper expounded on many different subjects of 
			importance to the American Jewish population.&nbsp; According to 
			Horowitz, the Pacific Northwest’s Jewish population needed to retain 
			its cultural identity.&nbsp; Thus, the overall purpose of <i>The Jewish 
			Transcript</i> was to reinforce the importance and significance of 
			Jews’ distinct physical characteristics, the education of the Jewish 
			youth, and maintenance of religious ideals.&nbsp; The paper also 
			expressed the population’s persistent voice in the struggle for 
			equality.&nbsp; Oftentimes, the paper communicated the struggle to keep 
			this identity and push for equality in the face of dreadful 
			anti-Semitism both locally and abroad.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The first 
			edition of <i>The Jewish Transcript</i> included an insert written 
			by Horowitz describing his 
			concerns, motivations, and intentions for the newspaper.&nbsp; Horowitz 
			conveyed his apprehension about founding such a newspaper, writing, 
			“At first, I absolutely opposed the idea as I did not believe that 
			sectarian as well as racial differences should be kept alive and I 
			then sincerely believed that a newspaper or magazine representing 
			and expounding a particular creed or race would tend to exaggerate 
			those differences and would not be helpful to either the spread of 
			Americanism or to keep alive the proper spirit of Judaism.”1&nbsp; 
			Apprehensive to endorse or promote a particular ethnic community, 
			Horowitz expressed fear the paper might stand as a violation of the 
			American sense of inclusiveness for all people.&nbsp; Not only could the 
			paper fail to benefit those involved, but he believed such a stand 
			had the potential to further Jews’ exclusiveness from the general 
			body of American citizens.&nbsp; This suggests the publisher was 
			optimistic about the integration of the Jewish population into 
			American culture and hoped to establish Jews’ equality with all 
			other people.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">However, 
			Horowitz’ statement further explained a shift in his thinking about 
			integration.&nbsp; “During the last ten years,” he suggested, “conditions 
			have changed.”&nbsp; Although the Jew had once been “encouraged in his 
			effort to become thoroughly Americanized…,&nbsp; [t]oday much is being 
			done to discourage him.”&nbsp; Unlike the encouragement of an earlier 
			time, new anti-Semitic sentiments and persecution convinced Horowitz 
			that “the Jew must organize, not for aggression but for 
			self-protection.”&nbsp; Given these conditions, he encouraged community 
			organization and hoped the newspaper would stand as a means of 
			“inter-communication” to convey the Jewish “ideas, his ideals, his 
			aspirations, and his principles.”&nbsp; Horowitz also explained that the 
			purpose of <i>The Jewish Transcript</i> was to “advocate the highest 
			ideals of Judaism, linked with the most strenuous Americanism.”2&nbsp; 
			Horowitz encouraged his audience to hold onto their “Jewish” 
			identity, while still proclaiming their fully “American” identity.&nbsp; 
			This suggests the publisher saw a “Jewish” identity as separate, but 
			not mutually exclusive to an “American” identity.&nbsp; Horowitz appeared 
			to strive for a blending of the two identities as the best path for 
			the Americanization of the Jewish-American.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Horowitz 
			explained that his newspaper would include both local and worldwide 
			news concerning anything of Jewish interest as well as things of 
			national importance.&nbsp; Although Horowitz provided a great deal of the 
			material for the newspaper, as a significant outlet for Jewish news, 
			many different groups and authors used the paper as a conduit for 
			reaching a wide audience within the community.&nbsp; <i>The Jewish 
			Transcript</i> reprinted the texts of speeches from various Jewish 
			religious leaders and regularly featured the work of Jewish arts and 
			media critics.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Throughout its 
			first two years, the newspaper focused heavily on the theme of a 
			distinct “Jewish” identity, particularly the connections between 
			“Jewish” physical appearance and identity.&nbsp; The form of facial 
			structure was widely discussed in articles that appeared in the <i>
			The Jewish Transcript.&nbsp; </i>An article on “The Jewish Nose” by Dr. 
			Schireson addressed the idea that the Jewish 
			population has a very distinct facial structure that sets them apart 
			from the surrounding peoples, particularly in the nose.&nbsp; Dr. Schireson, a prominent plastic surgeon of the time, suggested the 
			“outstanding characteristics” of the Jewish people “are the bony 
			prominence of the face, square of the projecting jaw, high, thick, 
			strait or hooked nose, heavy eyebrows, and high cheekbones.”&nbsp; But 
			most of all, this surgeon argued, the Jew’s “long nose is admitted 
			to be his most striking characteristic.”&nbsp; As Dr. Schireson observed, 
			his Jewish clients were “anxious not to be recognized as a Jew” and 
			“deplored” their “racial nose.”&nbsp; Many hoped to use the “discoveries 
			of plastic surgery to shorten and beautify their noses.”&nbsp; Yet, 
			arguing for racial pride, as Schireson proposed, the long nose of 
			the Jewish people was indicative of the Jewish people’s extreme 
			intelligence.&nbsp; As Dr. Schireson wrote, “The Jew has reason to be 
			proud of his distinctive racial characteristic, for it is, always 
			has been, and always will be, indicative of his superior 
			intelligence, mature intellectuality, of steadfastness and 
			will-power.”3&nbsp; Not only did the author argue for the absolutely 
			unique facial structure of the Jewish people, but also that Jewish 
			people were smarter, more mature, and stronger than the average 
			person.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This manner of 
			defining a certain people by facial characteristics was not new.&nbsp; Often, media images portrayed a specific group with 
			certain facial constructs.&nbsp; Usually in these images, features were 
			exaggerated, and used as a tool of humiliation by the dominant 
			culture.&nbsp; Thomas Nast, a prominent political cartoonist of the 
			19th century, frequently employed this tactic.&nbsp; In Nast’s 
			political cartoons, he famously portrayed the Irish people as wild, 
			drunken characters with ape-like faces.&nbsp; The “Jewish nose” idea served the same purpose by 
			stereotyping a people by their facial composition.&nbsp; In pride rather 
			than spite, Schireson proposed that a facial type conveyed the 
			superior identity of the Jewish population.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Education of the 
			Jewish youth also appeared multiple times in <i>The Jewish 
			Transcript</i> as something essential to the existence and further 
			development of the Jewish identity in the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; In the 
			paper’s mission statement, Horowitz declared, “It shall be the aim 
			of <i>The Jewish Transcript</i> to inculcate and develop in the 
			younger generation an ardent interest in Judaism, Jewish history and 
			modern Jewish problems.”4&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with Horowitz’ belief, the 
			newspaper featured many articles outlining the need for Jewish 
			education.&nbsp; As one article entitled “The Problem of Jewish Education 
			in America” contended, “our children must be imbued with a spirit of 
			devotion to Judaism to resist the forces that might seek to break 
			the hand which unifies them.”&nbsp; As the article explained, “The 
			American Jewish child is imbued with so many American ideals and 
			ideas that he naturally places the Hebrew school and its teachings 
			in an inferior category.”5&nbsp; To withstand the blows of anti-Semitism 
			and prevent the erosion of Jewish faith, articles in <i>The Jewish 
			Transcript</i> made an urgent call for the education of the younger 
			generation.&nbsp; In addition to their compulsory public education, the 
			author recommended a program of religious education, centered on the 
			acquisition of the Hebrew language and readings in the sacred 
			scripture of the Torah.&nbsp; The only way to “command the best energies 
			of the child,” the article continued, was through the formation of a 
			school with the “traditional tongue of the Jews; namely Hebrew” 
			along with “the teachings of Israel’s leading ideas and ideals.”&nbsp; 
			For the Jewish population to thrive, the author argued, “Let the 
			Jewry of America look to its future and begin with the youth.”6
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While many of 
			the contributors to <i>The Jewish Transcript </i>hoped to highlight 
			the connections between Jewish identity and physical characteristics 
			or education, others argued that Jewish culture could only be 
			maintained through religious practice.&nbsp; As one article suggested, 
			“Judaism is the vital possession of Jewry.&nbsp; Take away the religious 
			faith from any people, and you take away all that matters.”7&nbsp; In 
			addition to “kosher” eating rules and the observance of “Sabbath,” 
			many articles argued that religious practices were essential in the 
			preservation of the Jewish identity.&nbsp; As one article suggested, “the 
			Jewish faith is based on the Mosaic Law, the ten commandments,” and 
			the Jewish refusal to “accept a trinity.”8&nbsp; These laws, another 
			author argued, set Jews apart as the “chosen people of God- a people 
			chosen to be a blessing to all nations on earth…we are the people 
			whom God chose from among all the peoples.”9&nbsp; Although statements of 
			religious superiority were perhaps not unanimous, contributors to 
			the newspaper commonly stressed the significance of faith, history, 
			and religious practice to Jews’ cultural distinctiveness.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In addition to 
			preserving a distinct Jewish racial or ethnic identity, contributors 
			to <i>The Jewish Transcript</i> consistently refuted claims of 
			Jewish inferiority and touted the accomplishments of Jewish 
			scholars.&nbsp; As a number of authors argued, Jews had productively 
			contributed to American society, and therefore, deserved equal 
			standing.&nbsp; The paper regularly featured articles about the 
			accomplishments of Jewish intellectuals, artists, and scientists to 
			prove the importance of Jews to society.&nbsp; For example, the Chairman 
			of the B.B Educational Committee Mark M. Litchman authored an 
			article entitled, “Contributions of Jews to Human Progress,” which 
			featured the work of Jewish people.&nbsp; As he suggested, “Once the 
			knowledge is given to the Jew that his race has produced great 
			historical figures in all divisions of human progress he will have 
			good cause to be very proud of his racial and religious 
			heritage.”10&nbsp; Each subsequent edition featured a column dedicated to 
			the outstanding contributions of Jews in the areas of religious and 
			academic thought.&nbsp; Two articles discussed the Jew’s contribution to 
			religion’s perception of “monotheism,” and “what polytheism is”.11&nbsp; 
			Other articles focused on the Jew’s contribution to the fields of 
			astronomy 12, economics 13, biology 14, and law.15&nbsp; Other articles 
			praised local Jewish celebrities for their role in local plays, 
			operas, and politics.&nbsp; The regularity and prominence of these 
			articles suggest the paper hoped to refute arguments of Jewish 
			inferiority.&nbsp; Moreover, by pointing out the importance of Jewish 
			contributions, the authors made an argument for equal standing in 
			American society.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Local and 
			international Anti-Semitism was also a common theme in the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			As one article suggested, “wherever the Jews are fated to suffer, 
			the suffering affects the whole of Jewry.”16&nbsp; Given the universality 
			of anti-Semitism, the international Jewish population needed to 
			stayed connected and bound by a common faith in the face of constant 
			persecution. According to another author, the American Jew as well 
			as the international Jew, defined themselves as a people that have 
			suffered historically and still suffers at their present time.&nbsp; As 
			this author suggested, “For the Jews have suffered…the outstanding 
			fact of Jewish history is the struggle of a scattered people for 
			survival…both material and spiritual, a struggle which maintained by 
			means of a supreme faith which kept this people intact.”17&nbsp; Many of 
			the Jewish contributors to <i>The Jewish Transcript</i> felt the 
			Jewish people were destined to suffer anti-Semitism as their 
			ancestors suffered for years before them.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Possible 
			theories about the motivation for this hatred of the Jewish people 
			in America appeared multiple times throughout the first two years of
			<i>The Jewish Transcript</i>.&nbsp; Some argued that “Anti-Semites in our 
			day and age advance several reasons…some say that the Jews are an 
			inferior race, some say they are a disturbing factor in society…(or) 
			that they control the economic affairs of the world and use their 
			power only to satisfy their own needs.”18&nbsp; This author argued the 
			Jewish population may be seen as a lesser civilization by their 
			persecutors, or one with too much power and not enough control.&nbsp; 
			Other possible theories about the motivation for anti-Semitism 
			recorded in the newspaper include the theological standpoint of “the 
			supposed killing of Christ by Jews.”19&nbsp; According to this author, 
			the Christian faith’s claim that Jews killed their divine Christ 
			kindled the hatred of the surrounding population as well.&nbsp; Almost 
			every issue throughout the first two years of <i>The Jewish 
			Transcript</i> included some account of wrong-doing toward a Jewish 
			person or population.&nbsp; This appears to convey the previously 
			discussed deep-set desire of the Jewish population to educate the 
			Jewish people about Jewish discrimination in order to further the 
			cause of pulling the Jewish population of the Pacific Northwest 
			closer together to withstand their own struggles. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>
			The Jewish Transcript</i> represented the Pacific Northwest Jewish 
			people in a challenging, but essential struggle for the retention of 
			their Jewish cultural identity in America.&nbsp; Balancing&nbsp; 
			Americanization and cultural retention, Herman Horowitz hoped to 
			maintain a distinct Jewish religious and cultural community.&nbsp; At the 
			same time, the paper made a strong argument for equality by 
			demonstrating the accomplishments of Jewish people.&nbsp; This fight was 
			not easy, however, and the Jewish community regularly confronted 
			anti-Semitism.&nbsp; The Jewish American experience of the mid 1920s, as 
			seen through the articles of <i>The Jewish Transcript</i>, was an 
			extremely difficult episode for all involved.</span></p>
