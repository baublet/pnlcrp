		    <p class="arial10">Whereas much of the African American civil rights movement grew out of Protestant churches, Hubbard became involved in Seattle&rsquo;s civil rights movement through his participation in the Catholic Church.&nbsp; He co-founded the Seattle chapter of the Catholic Interracial Council (CIC) and Seattle&rsquo;s Project Equality, and through these  activities went on to play a prominent role in the Central Area Civil Rights Committee (CACRC) and the Seattle Model Cities Program.&nbsp; He  served at different times as the President and Executive Director for the National Office of Black Catholics.&nbsp; </p>
		    <p class="arial10">Hubbard was also an active in the labor movement, first as a member of the United Garment Workers Union Local 17 in Seattle, serving as its President and then as a Business Representative. Beginning in the 1970s, Hubbard turned this experience in labor relations toward working as a contract compliance officer for local and state government agencies, enforcing affirmative action on a diverse range of government contracts for over thirty years.&nbsp; Mr. Hubbard passed away  May 5, 2007 at age 82.
