font-family:Arial">“The Part She Played”, by Susie Cayton, is the story of Mrs. 
                  Crosswaite, a woman who asserts her power as the moral backbone of 
                  the family.&nbsp; In this short story, the end justifies the means when 
                  Mrs. Crosswaite falsely presents herself as helplessly drunk in an 
                  effort to subtly convince her husband of his duty to focus attention 
                  towards the home for family stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:Arial">Finally, some might say womanlike, Mrs. Crosswaite owned to 
                  the part she played, but she said:&nbsp; ‘I thought you ought to spend 
                  your time in your own home and you now have for your wife a very 
                  happy woman.’<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>

font-family:Arial">As an educated African American woman in early twentieth 
                  century America, Susie Cayton exercised the parts she played to 
                  advocate for the social mobility of her race.&nbsp; The title of her 
                  story spoke to the complicated roles Susie played in her own life as 
                  an African American wife, mother, and social activist in twentieth 
                  century America.&nbsp; Seattle was her home from 1896 to 1940, and in 
                  that time she raised a legendary family, exercised her skills as a 
                  newsworthy and talented writer, and was dedicated to the social 
                  advancement of African Americans.&nbsp; The literary works left behind by 
                  Susie Cayton provide a window into her personal life and help 
                  clarify her commitment to the social uplift of the Northwest 
                  community.&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:Arial">Her husband, Horace Cayton, publisher of the <i>Seattle 
                  Republican</i> and later <i>Cayton’s Weekly</i>, is well known to 
                  historians, as are her two sons, Horace Cayton Jr., the eminent 
                  sociologist, and Revels Cayton, the labor activist.&nbsp; Susie Cayton’s 
                  biography is still being pieced together.&nbsp; Important contributions 
                  have been made by Richard Hobbs, whose book <i>The Cayton Legacy: An 
                  African American Family</i>, is based on extensive interviews with 
                  Cayton descendents.&nbsp; Historian, Quintard Taylor, gives significant 
                  attention to the Cayton family in <i>The Forging of a Black 
                  Community:&nbsp; Seattle’s Central District from 1870 through the Civil 
                  Rights Era</i>&nbsp; and wrote several essays recognizing Mrs. Cayton’s 
                  social activist efforts in the Northwest.&nbsp; Finally, local historian 
                  Ed Diaz beautifully compiled Susie Cayton’s literary efforts in <i> Stories by Cayton</i>.&nbsp; This essay builds on those sources while 
                  also examining stories that Susie Cayton wrote for the <i>Seattle 
                  Republican.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></span></p>

font-family:Arial">As owners of the <i>Seattle Republican</i>, the newspaper 
                  that Horace Cayton founded in 1896, the Cayton family was one of 
                  Seattle’s most prominent middle class African American families, but 
                  the limited opportunities for African Americans in the area 
                  continued to make their position within the social milieu 
                  difficult.&nbsp; When Susie arrived Mississippi in 1896, the black 
                  community made up less than one percent of the total population of 
                  Seattle.&nbsp; In 1900, the black community numbered 406 out of nearly 
                  81,000 total residents in Seattle.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  Blacks were not the only significant racial minority, as was the 
                  case in the South.&nbsp; Seattle featured a complicated demography where 
                  Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Native American, and African American 
                  communities all existed in a framework of white supremacy.&nbsp; Caught 
                  in the employment restrictions exercised by Seattle’s largely white 
                  dominated labor unions, unskilled blacks generally found themselves 
                  limited to jobs as janitors, porters, and domestic workers.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  Effectively locked out of lucrative professions and small in number, 
                  Seattle’s pre-World War II black community lived in a space that 
                  symbolized the lesser evil for those escaping the racial tensions of 
                  the Northeast and South. </span></p>

font-family:Arial">Despite the overt discriminatory practices in employment and 
                  housing opportunity, Washington Territory was uniquely progressive 
                  in comparison to the rest of the nation at the turn of the 
                  nineteenth century.&nbsp; Black males were able to vote.&nbsp; In contrast to 
                  segregationist laws, race riots, and the violence of white supremacy 
                  prevalent in the South, Washington had no discriminatory laws on the 
                  books at the turn of the century.&nbsp; In 1890, the Washington State 
                  legislature passed the Public Accommodation Act which protected 
                  civil and legal rights for all Washingtonians and banned racial 
                  discriminatory practices.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  Yet, in 1895, the state dropped the penalties associated with the 
                  act, thus nullifying any potential enforcement of the law.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:Arial">Susie Cayton’s prominence within the black community came 
                  partly from her being the daughter of Hiram Revels, the first 
                  African American elected to the U.S Senate.&nbsp; Born Susie Sumner 
                  Revels to parents Hiram and Pheobe Bass Revels in 1870, she was the 
                  third generation of free blacks from her family, spanning before the 
                  Civil War.&nbsp; Susie was given her middle name in honor of Charles 
                  Sumner, the Massachusetts Senator who had let the fight in Congress 
                  to abolish slavery.&nbsp; Sumner was also one of the architects of the 
                  Reconstruction measures that had given former slaves the chance to 
                  vote and hold political positions after the Civil War.&nbsp; Susie’s 
                  father, Hiram Revels, had won election as Senator from Mississippi 
                  in 1870, taking the seat that had once been held by the confederate 
                  leader Jefferson Davis.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  Her birth came the same year her father was sworn into Senate.&nbsp; 
                  Susie spent the beginning years of her life in Washington D.C. until 
                  her father moved to Mississippi to lead Alcorn University.&nbsp; </span> </p>

font-family:Arial">Raised in the shadow of her father’s political success, 
                  Susie’s upbringing was remarkable in comparison to the majority of 
                  blacks of her time.&nbsp; Young Susie pursued her interest in writing and 
                  by the age of sixteen she received a degree from Rust University in 
                  Holly Springs, Mississippi.&nbsp; She taught at the university for three 
                  years and later returned to the school as a student where she earned 
                  a degree in nurse training at the age of twenty-three.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  While in Mississippi near her parents, she came across the <i> Seattle Republican</i>, a Northwest newspaper sent to her father, 
                  Hiram Revels, by the editor, Horace Cayton.&nbsp; Horace had attended 
                  Alcorn University during the time Susie’s father led the school and 
                  developed a deep respect for the former Senator.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  In Seattle, he had been able to navigate his way into a position of 
                  power within the Washington State Republican Party.&nbsp; A position 
                  significant enough that he could successfully publish a partisan 
                  newspaper that impressed both Susie and her father.&nbsp; Susie responded 
                  to Horace’s journalistic success and submitted her own work to the <i>Seattle Republican</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was the beginning of the personal 
                  connection and long distance courtship between the two.&nbsp; </span></p>

                  woman within the African American community she sought to write the 
                  part that would contribute to the history of African American’s in 
                  the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; In 1896, Horace Cayton premiered Susie 
                  Revels’ work to the Northwest audience in the January 4th edition of <i>Seattle Republican</i>.&nbsp; The edition of the paper featured a 
                  photo of Susie and an article she wrote entitled, “Negroes at the 
                  Atlanta Exposition.”&nbsp; In this article, Miss Susie Revels reported 
                  meeting with Chief John Tevi of the West African Dahomey tribe. Tevi 
                  had been accused of exploiting villagers he guided around the world 
                  to perform at events such as the World’s Fair.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  But Susie Revels was unimpressed by the accusations, and instead 
                  expressed great respect for the Africans Tevi traveled with and the 
                  message he offered.&nbsp; In her article Susie wrote:</span></p>

                  described by Richard Hobbs in <i>The Cayton Legacy</i>:&nbsp; “When she 
                  arrived in Seattle, her betrothed—a proper Victorian 
                  gentleman—arranged separated lodgings until they could be married.”<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  The two wed on July 12th, 1896, when Susie was 26.&nbsp; Susie and 
                  Horace’s joining was a complementary exchange of academic, social 
                  and political status combined with a fervor to assist in the 
                  advancement of the black race.&nbsp; </span></p>

                  sentimentality, were common themes found in Susie Cayton’s writing.&nbsp; 
                  In 1902, <i>Seattle Republican</i> published, “In the Land of Fire,” 
                  a short story by Mrs. Susie Cayton, wherein Barkri, a woman raised 
                  in a rural society in South America, matures to discover the customs 
                  of her land as intolerable.&nbsp; Children are raised to forget their 
                  familial ties, sickly children are thrown into pits of fire, and 
                  useless women are victims of cannibalism.&nbsp; When her husband dies at 
                  sea, and the tribe threatens to send her sickly baby to the fire 
                  pits, Barkri seeks refuge and raises her daughter in anonymity in 
                  the mountains to avoid the tragic result of tribal tradition.&nbsp; The 
                  baby survived but grew to forget the origins of her family. </span> </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;

                  women of the island, and her daughter never by look or sign 
                  recognized her, who was ever near in time of sickness or trouble, 
                  never asked how or why the most choice fish and portions of seal

                  met by a detective who tells her she is a U.S. citizen, but Barkri 
                  refuses to leave the daughter who had already forgotten her.&nbsp; The 
                  night before the detective is to leave Barkri attends a tribal

                  Perhaps Susie tried to capture the beginnings of enlightened 
                  thinking among captive slaves, or her own juxtaposition within black 
                  society as an educated woman.&nbsp; The notion of severed familial ties 
                  alludes to the social destruction blacks experienced during

font-family:Arial">Susie’s privileged family heritage coupled with the success 
                  of the <i>Seattle Republican</i> made many blacks skeptical of the 
                  Cayton’s intentions.&nbsp; Mrs. Cayton stood apart from her female 
                  counterparts, white and black.&nbsp; Following emancipation and in the 
                  aftermath of reconstruction, most women of Susie’s time were caught 
                  up with the demands of individual and familial survival.&nbsp; Many 
                  blacks were reduced to the simple task of keeping food on the table 
                  during the early twentieth century. As an elite and educated third 
                  generation free black woman, Mrs. Cayton was self consciously 
                  different. Much like the integrity <i>Seattle Republican</i> wished 
                  to portray, many of the characters in Susie Cayton’s stories were 
                  ambiguous in racial affiliation.&nbsp; Stories such as, “The Part She 
                  Played”, “Last Rites”, and “My Meeting with the Presence”, focused 
                  on themes central to human experience.&nbsp; Susie also contributed to 
                  the success of <i>Seattle Republican</i> as associate editor by 
                  delivering newsworthy articles for the black and white community.&nbsp; A 
                  short article found in <i>Seattle Republican</i> entitled “Stop Your 
                  Paper” illustrates the complicated nature of the Cayton’s position 
                  as a middle class black family providing a newspaper for a 
                  multiracial Seattle audience:&nbsp; </span></p>

                  community.&nbsp; The complicated editorial strategy did not always sit 
                  well withvthe black community. Some in the community saw the 
                  Cayton’s as catering to white society.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:Arial">In 1970, University of Washington students interviewed 
                  Virginia Clark Gayton.&nbsp; The Gayton family has a prominent history in 
                  20th century Seattle&nbsp;&nbsp; Susie Cayton was the godmother of Virginia 
                  Gayton’s husband, John Jacob Gayton.<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a> But in the interview, Virginia, who was only a child at the time of 
                  the Caytons’ greatest success, recalled the prominence of the Cayton 
                  family with a backhanded compliment that suggested their difference 
                  from the rest of the African American community: “They [the Caytons] 
                  had a beautiful home on Castle [Capital] Hill and had Japanese 
                  servants and what not.&nbsp; And so they didn’t have to do any 
                  housework.”<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> Gayton went on to suggest that the Caytons didn’t represent the 
                  average African American, and in turn, were inattentive to the 
                  practical needs of the black community.&nbsp; She added that “They had a 
                  good educational background and a history of disagreeing and, you 
                  know, fighting for what they….”<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  It is with this statement that Gayton stops short without ending her 
                  sentence, but the impression is that the Caytons were perceived as 
                  neglecting black issues and focusing on their own success.&nbsp; </span> </p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Virginia Clark 
                  Gayton also drew a distinction between middle class and laboring 
                  blacks in general arguing that, “In the South the educated Black 
                  people…they had the same [problem] copying white culture.&nbsp; They 
                  looked down on people who did laboring work.”<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  While there is no evidence to suggest that Susie treated blue collar 
                  workers any differently, her indifference to menial labor didn’t go 
                  unnoticed by the black community.&nbsp; In her interview, Virginia Gayton 
                  went on to share that “of course after they lost the money 
                  [following the demise of the <i>Seattle Republican</i>], why they 
                  didn’t know exactly how to cope with that.&nbsp; I think that’s because 
                  Mrs. Cayton didn’t know to keep house and it was such a blow to Mr. 
                  Cayton.”<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a> Gayton’s comments seemed to express resentment about Mrs. Cayton’s

                  a contrasting picture of Susie as someone who had servants but 
                  didn’t think herself above them.&nbsp; Recounting an argument described 
                  by Horace Jr. in <i>The Long Old Road</i>, Hobbs wrote that Horace 
                  Sr. tried to forbid Susie from talking to Nish, their Japanese 
                  servant, and Mr. Fontello, the garbage man, stating, they should be 
                  “kept in their place.”&nbsp; Mrs. Cayton is said to have defiantly 
                  retorted that the garbage man was “one of the most intelligent men 
                  she had ever met, and I will continue to talk with him for as long 
                  as I please.”&nbsp; Susie said she could learn Japanese from Mr. Nish, 
                  and that Mr. Fontello was a good conversationalist.<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp; </span></p>

                  and be active in the community as a detriment, saw it as his 
                  greatest strength.&nbsp; In the July 23rd, 1909, edition of <i>Seattle 
                  Republican</i>, Susie Cayton’s husband praised his wife in the 
                  article, “Good Woman’s Helping Hand.”&nbsp; Horace described Mrs. Cayton 
                  as a woman “…who not only makes husbands men in the true sense of 
                  the word, but who makes the men and women of tomorrow.”&nbsp; At the time 
                  of this article, Susie and Horace Cayton had just celebrated their 
                  thirteenth anniversary.&nbsp; In 1909 The <i>Seattle Republican</i> was 
                  recognized by the <i>Seattle Times</i> for not missing an issue 
                  since its debut and in the following July 23rd article Horace

                  nature of the issues she addressed in the black community.&nbsp; Ahead of 
                  popular opinion and academic scholarship on the issue, Susie warned 
                  of the psychological harm of having black children play with white 
                  baby dolls.&nbsp; She encouraged black parents to make their own dolls, 
                  and not to settle if retailers refused to stock black dolls.<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  It was from the ground up that Susie saw change needed to be made 
                  and she recognized the message white dolls were sending to black 
                  children.&nbsp; </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">At a time when blacks were consumed with economic survival in 
                  the face of discrimination, children’s toys may have appeared a bit 
                  of a privileged topic. But in fact it was part of a broader social 
                  vision that Mrs. Cayton chose to address.&nbsp; The majority of women’s 
                  social work within the black community centered on activism through 
                  the church. Susie Cayton often acted outside these boundaries, and 
                  took it upon herself to exercise her ingenuity and social status to 
                  tackle particular problems.&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:Arial">In 1906, Mrs. Cayton organized a group of black women in the 
                  community to assist twin baby girls orphaned and sick with the 
                  rickets.&nbsp; King County Hospital sent the girls to a mental 
                  institution in Medical Lake, Washington.&nbsp; Through her organizing 
                  efforts, Susie not only rescued the girls and sponsored a foster 
                  family for them.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  In the same stride she founded the Dorcas Charity Club, which was 
                  recognized as one of the more active clubs in the Seattle area.&nbsp; 
                  Susie’s social circle focused on welfare issues and the progress of 
                  the black opportunity.&nbsp; The Dorcas Charity Club alleviated some of 
                  the harsher conditions facing African Americans.&nbsp; They provided toys 
                  for orphans and living expenses for widows in Seattle’s black 
                  community.<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  The Dorcas Club sought to help the most destitute of the black 
                  community.&nbsp; Possibly Susie Cayton’s most well documented legacy, 
                  with exception to her literary works left behind, the Dorcas Charity 
                  Club focused on social welfare issues and individual advancement in 
                  the black community.&nbsp; In 1907, The Dorcas Club aligned with the 
                  founders of Seattle Children’s Hospital to establish a policy of 
                  prohibiting discrimination of race, religion, or ability to pay when 
                  it came to accepting and treating sick or malnourished children.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
                  This alliance was a great advancement to the social services 
                  extended to blacks at the time.&nbsp; There are also reports of the

                  political boundaries.&nbsp; In her 1918 story, “My Meeting with the 
                  Presence,” Susie describes in first person the experience of 
                  spiritual awakening through the extension of empathy to mankind.&nbsp; 
                  The author goes through a series of accepting steps or prayers for 
                  saving her individual soul, then her family’s souls, the souls of 
                  the Negro race, and, finally, with her last prayer to save the souls 
                  of all mankind, she is “transformed”:&nbsp; “‘God save the world,’ 
                  vehemently I prayed”.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

                  Due to a hung jury, the judge discharged the case, yet, as “The Part 
                  She Played” suggests, the experience may have shaken Susie. In that 
                  1902 story, Susie introduces Mrs. Crosswaite as a lonely wife 
                  suffering from anxiety, headaches, and unhappiness in her marriage 
                  and ready to take extraordinary measures to convince her husband to 
                  refocus on the family. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

                  lay […] How it was only a short time since she could choose from 
                  several invitations where and how she would spend the evenings.&nbsp; 
                  Never a thought seemed to reach him of the happy home circle he had 
                  broken when he took her away to reign queen of his own home.&nbsp; It was

                  her writing reveals the importance of black women’s roles in the 
                  family.&nbsp; As a mother, Susie Cayton gave birth to five healthy 
                  children, but raised seven; Emma, Ruth, Madge, Horace Jr., Revels, 
                  Lillie, and Susan.&nbsp; And in her reflection, many of the Cayton 
                  children’s destinies would take them down the path of their mother’s 
                  exemplary activism.&nbsp; </span></p>

font-family:Arial">Perhaps one of the most difficult heartbreaks Susie endured 
                  was the death of her eldest daughter Ruth, in 1919.&nbsp; Ruth was a 
                  revolutionary in her own right, breaking from the ingrained moral 
                  principles of the family legacy.&nbsp; Susie and Ruth were very close 
                  despite the daughter’s choices in life.&nbsp; As her brother Revels 
                  relayed later:</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">…she made the most healthy adjustment of all of us 
                  children…And she was the first in our family to break away and seek 
                  full membership in the Negro community with no apparent thought 
                  about our family mission or the manner in which we had been raised.<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[34]</span></span></a> &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Susie had faith 
                  that Ruth would find her way and the young woman would go on to 
                  continue her part in the Cayton legacy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Ruth was cut 
                  short from fulfilling her mother’s wish, and Susie became a mother 
                  to her infant granddaughter, Susan.</span></p>

                  education, and self respect as a tool to overcome the insanity of 
                  institutionalized racism.&nbsp; As a tool to combat the negative forces 
                  that met them when they went out in the world, Susie encouraged her 
                  children to take pride in their racial and family heritage by, 
                  telling stories of family memories, and stressed education as the 
                  key.&nbsp; </span></p>

                  When Madge ventured out into the world, she faced the employment 
                  restrictions that prevented blacks from obtaining jobs in the 
                  professional fields.&nbsp; In the University of Washington interview,

                  remains were cremated and returned home to be scattered in the

                  force behind her family’s accomplishments.&nbsp; The forty-four years 
                  Susie dedicated to Seattle helped to define and assert African 
                  American identity in the black community as well as her family.&nbsp; As 
                  an educated black woman, the part Susie Cayton played as an astute 
                  writer was a voice that most likely would have gone unheard had she 
                  not had the success of the family newspaper to back her up.&nbsp; Like 
                  many of the social and political efforts of women during the early 
                  twentiethn century, especially ones married to prominent men, the 
                  legacy of Susie Sumner Revels Cayton has been overlooked in the 
                  chronicles of Pacific Northwest history.&nbsp; Susie was able to employ 
                  her political heritage and assert opinions that would have otherwise 
                  gone unheard to the dominant white society that had little interest 
                  in the opinions of African American women.&nbsp; The stories and essays 
                  left behind by Susie Cayton provide a window to the past to explore 
                  the complicated roles she played as a writer, wife, community 
                  activist, and mother in early twentieth century Seattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> </p>
