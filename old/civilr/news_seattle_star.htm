	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oust Seattle Enemy Aliens&rdquo; read the <i>Seattle Star</i>&rsquo;s front-page headline on February 16th, 1942. It was just over two months since the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of war with Japan, and local sentiment ran high against local Japanese and Japanese-American residents. The <i>Seattle Star</i>, a popular daily newspaper published from 1889-1947, provides an excellent window into the question of how such strong anti-Japanese sentiment arose in the months between the attack on Pearl Harbor and the issue of Executive Order 9066, which established the federal wartime internment camps. This essay examines the <i>Seattle Star</i> from December 1941 through February 1942, focusing on the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> reaction to key events such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the issue of Executive Order 9066 and, in particular, on the paper&rsquo;s hostile and sometimes racist portrayal of native Japanese and Japanese-Americans, especially after the paper was sold in January 1942. By analyzing letters to the editor during these months, this approach also allows us to discover the local non-Japanese population&rsquo;s views on the war and the idea of internment. </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">The <i>Seattle Star</i> was a locally owned paper, first published on February 2, 1899. In 1909 it was sold to the E.W. Scripps family. Then, in January 1942, it was sold to Howard W. Parrish, a one-time employee of the <i>Star</i>. It ended publication on August 13, 1947 due to increases in labor costs and a shortage of newsprint. Recently, another paper under the same name began print but there is no connection to its namesake. Although it did not have as large a staff, circulation, or readership as the <i>Seattle Post Intelligencer</i> or the <i>Seattle Times, </i>the <i>Star</i> still managed to reach people throughout King County as evidenced by, among other indicators, the locations of writers to the editor.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">In December 1941 Japan was a nation full of desire for national power, respect, and supremacy. It wanted to achieve equal footing with the Western Powers and revise the unequal treaties that it had signed with those nations in the past. Following the precedent of Europe and the United States, it began to industrialize in the late 19th century and was the dominant imperial power in Asia by the early 20th century. Historian Kenneth B. Pyle has implied that because of Japanese ambitions and the overall climate of militarism of the 1930s in both Europe and Asia, the &ldquo;road to the Pacific War&rdquo; was one that could not be have been avoided. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Pyle also shows how the anti-Asian racism that would be thrust to the surface by Pearl Harbor had deep roots.&nbsp; Racial tensions first began to develop on the United States western coast between white Americans and Japanese immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1905, the California legislature unanimously passed a resolution calling on the government to limit immigration, characterizing Japanese immigrants as &ldquo;immoral, intemperate, quarrelsome men bound to labor for a pittance.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a> The next year the San Francisco School Board created separate schools for all children of Chinese, Korean, or Japanese descent.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">&nbsp;Japan understood these measures to imply that the Japanese were still not on equal footing with the Western powers. They felt that, as an industrialized nation, their nationals should not be grouped with people from China or Korea. In the aftermath of World War I, US President Woodrow Wilson had tried to appease the Japanese by allowing them to write an equality of races clause for the League of Nations charter, which would read &ldquo;that the principles of equality of nations and the just treatment of their nationals &hellip; [shall be] a fundamental basis of future international relations in the new world organization;&rdquo;<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> however, the measure was never voted on. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">From Japan&rsquo;s perspective, the last insult from the United States came when Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924. This act is also known as the Japanese Exclusion Act since it plainly states that although immigrants from other nations would still be admitted on a revised quota system, no more Japanese immigrants would be admitted to the United States. This, coupled with America taking a protectionist stance after the stock market crash of 1929, caused Japan to turn further inward and focus on the consolidation of its own economic, political, and military sphere in Asia and the Pacific. </span> </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">In the 1930s Japan built a strong military government fueled by militant nationalism. The invasion of Manchuria and its transformation into Manchukuo led to censure by the League of Nations, which Japan then abandoned. It decided to control East Asia and spoke of an &ldquo;Asian Monroe Doctrine&rdquo; and later a &ldquo;Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere.&rdquo; In his book <i>War without Mercy,</i> John Dower argues that Japanese thinking was characterized by an &ldquo;intense self-preoccupation&rdquo; that emphasized Japanese virtue and purity.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a> Japanese citizens made sacrifices for the whole to prove their loyalty and spiritual commitment to the nation. They felt Americans were materialistic and egocentric due to their upheld values of capitalism, individualism, and liberalism. Thus, Japan began its drive towards joining the Tripartite Pact and entering World War II.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">On December 7, 1941, Japan not only attacked the US fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor but also the Philippines, Wake Island, Guam, Malaya, Thailand, Shanghia, and Midway. US citizens were outraged since peace talks between the United States and Japan had been taking place in Washington. The US felt that it had been patient with Japan in awaiting its answer as to why it had been increasing its forces in Indochina. When America declared war on Japan on December 8, so too did many other countries, including Britain and Canada. China followed suit on December 9. Japan countered by invading  the Philippines on December 10 and also seizing Guam. By the end of December the Japanese Imperial forces had also invaded Burma, British Borneo, Hong Kong, and Luzon. General Douglas MacArthur began to withdraw from Manila to Bataan, and the British surrendered Hong Kong. Although the Japanese were giving a tough battle, sentiment remained strong that the US would prevail. Locally, some people were very upset about others not following black out procedures.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a> But on the whole, in Seattle and throughout the nation, the attack on Pearl Harbor united Americans in common cause. One <i>Seattle Star </i>reader summed up the result of the bombing of Pearl Harbor like this:</span></p>

It is this anxiety, turned suspicion and fear, that a close analysis of the <i>Seattle Star</i> in the months after Pearl Harbor allows us to glimpse.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">At the beginning of December the <i>Seattle Star </i>focused largely on Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, Japanese Ambassador to Washington, and Saburo Kurusu, special envoy, who were charged with effecting a change in the minds of American leaders with respect to Japanese militarism. Daily columnist Raymond Clapper felt &ldquo;Japan&rsquo;s stalling, plainly that.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a> When Japan rejected the US request that it leave French Indo-China, the <i>Star </i>called Saburo Kurusu a &ldquo;modern day Judas.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 8, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the war declaration with Japan after he went before a joint session of both houses and pledged that the US would triumph over treacherous Japan, &ldquo;so help us God.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> The <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> Raymond Clapper, also outraged by Pearl Harbor, was more far more bombastic in his prediction. &ldquo;Japan has chosen to live by the sword and she will die by the sword,&rdquo; Clapper wrote. &ldquo;Japan will be blasted, bombed, burned, and starved. Her people will suffer ghastly tortures. A nation which had possibilities of becoming one of the rulers of the world will be reduced to a pitiful huddling people on a poor little group of islands.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&rdquo; Clapper&rsquo;s column, with its vision of &ldquo;ghastly tortures&rdquo; and of the Japanese as a &ldquo;pitiful huddling people,&rdquo; set the tone for much of the <i>Star&rsquo;s</i> subsequent war coverage.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day after the Pearl Harbor attacks, the <i>Star</i> also reported on its front page that Attorney General Francis Biddle announced that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had &quot;seized&quot; 736 Japanese nationals in the United States and the Hawaiian islands.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> Here the language is significant. The word &quot;seized&quot; seems rather harsh when considering that the vast majority of those detained were innocent, law-abiding people.

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">While this article appeared on the front-page, another article, this one about American-born Japanese pledging loyalty to the US, appeared on the fourth page. The article featured James Sakamoto, a prominent Japanese-American journalist and community leader and his wife. After news of the beating of a Japanese person in Seattle broke, Mrs. Sakamoto is quoted as saying, &ldquo;I was going to take the children downtown to do some Christmas shopping but I&rsquo;m afraid it may not be safe.&quot;<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a> Her husband agreed, saying that he believed there was &quot;a remote possibility of our becoming the victim of public passion and hysteria.&quot; And yet Sakamoto used the opportunity to reassure readers of the loyalty and patriotism of Seattle&#39;s Japanese and Japanese American residents. &quot;If this should occur,&quot; Sakamoto said, &quot;we will stand firm in our resolution that even if America may &lsquo;disown&rsquo; us we will never &lsquo;disown&rsquo; America.&rdquo; He later acted as the General Chairmen of the Japanese-American Citizens League where he organized more than 300 volunteers from Seattle&rsquo;s Japanese community for civilian defense work.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Sakamoto was the most prominent among a number of Japanese Americans to publicly declare loyalty to this country in the wake of Pearl Harbor. For example, the national headquarters of the Japanese American Citizens League in San Franscio &ldquo;unequivocally condemned Japan for [the] attack on our country.&quot;<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> The <i>Seattle Star</i> had an unbiased view toward Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans and even added to the article on Sakamoto the &ldquo;inspiring example&rdquo; of 3,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry enlisting in the national defense effort, noting that &ldquo;the percentage in proportion to population is greater than any other racial group such as Italian-Americans and French-Americans.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a> The <i>Star</i> also reported that Japanese-American citizens in Honolulu were praised for their loyalty by both civilian and military officials. Joseph P. Poindexter, governor of the territory of Hawaii, praised them for &ldquo;the splendid example they are setting for the mainland in calm, determined conduct.&quot;<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Aside from declaring their loyalty, many Japanese citizens rushed to get birth certificates and proper identification<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a> and turned in guns even though it was not required for non-citizens to turn in weapons.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> To prevent discrimination against them, the Chinese community printed buttons reading &ldquo;Not from Nippon&quot;<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a> or wore jackets that said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot!

Freeman, commandant of the 13th naval district, who said the &quot;immediate problem for the civilian population is to be on guard for possible sabotage &hellip; I realized that the very great majority of our people, including Japanese residents, are loyal to our country and it therefore is important to avoid unjust or unfounded suspicion.&quot;<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a> This view was also reflected by the Seattle Urban League, which urged citizens not to get involved in any measures and to allow the government agencies to handle the control measures.&quot;<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a> By presenting these views and favorable comments about the local Japanese population the <i>Star</i> almost seems to be trying to convince individuals that they should be tolerant of others.</span></p>

One article featured an alderman, H D. Witon, who charged that Japanese wardens at the Boeing Aircraft plant had control of flashlights during blackouts and could signal to attacking aircrafts. Witon&#39;s claim was taken seriously enough to be investigated by ARP officials.<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[30]</span></span></a> Another article detailed how anyone<i> </i>who had spent the last five out of ten years in Washington State could withdraw a pension regardless of citizenship. The <i>Star</i> seemed to be suggesting with this article that that should not be the case. Another strange story was a letter written by a W.D.M. who said that on December 1st, the Japanese Hotel Association had said &quot;&#39;for various reasons we are obliged to raise you rent $1 more per month.&rsquo; On December 7th, the Japs began war upon the United States.

font-family:Arial">At the start of the New Year, Japan was advancing into Burma, having already captured Manila, North Borneo, and Rabaul. The British were forced to withdraw into Singapore and a siege of Singapore began January 31st. Still, the United States was confident that it would win the war. The economy at home was finally booming due to the war after more than a decade of depression. And Japanese internment was becoming an accepted idea among many as an answer to the perceived threat of espionage and subversion. </span></p>

E. Baum shared this view, stating that &ldquo;[o]ne hears of Japanese school children being forced off buses by schoolmates undoubtedly influenced by ignorant parents &hellip; racial persecution has no place in the American way of life, as it is the various contributions of each race which makes the United States the unique nations it is.&quot;<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></span></a> This sample of the readership and the <i>Star</i>&rsquo;s decision to print them left the impression that the paper was on the side of the Japanese. However, aside from these letters to the editor from concerned citizens, very few news stories documenting the harassment faced by the local Japanese population appeared in the <i>Star</i>. It is as if the <i>Star&#39;s </i>editors believed that such stories were not worth reporting. </span></p>

font-family:Arial">Tighter restrictions soon began to be placed on Japanese residents. They were no longer allowed to bear arms and were limited in their travel. Along with these increased restrictions, Attorney General Biddle and President Roosevelt announced requirements for the re-registration of 1,100,000 aliens<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[38]</span></span></a> in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It was well known that internment for the duration of the war awaited those that failed to comply with the re-registration order.<a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[39]</span></span></a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also in January that the paper began running articles on the proposed ban of Japanese along the British Columbia coast.<a name="_ednref40" title href="#_edn40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[40]</span></span></a> Alderman H. D. Wilson is reported as having said, &ldquo;Japanese should be rounded up first and investigated later.&rdquo; To balance this view the paper also ran Mayor J. Cornett&rsquo;s warning against any action that might embarrass the Canadian government. Later, the <i>Star</i> wrote that Mayor Cornett also felt that moving the aliens might affect the thousands of American and Canadian nationals in Japanese custody. He suggested that the decision be delayed for two weeks.<a name="_ednref41" title href="#_edn41"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[41]</span></span></a> He was unsuccessful and less than a week later the <i>Star</i> reported, &ldquo;Canada clears coast of Japs.&quot;<a name="_ednref42" title href="#_edn42"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[42]</span></span></a> Here it seems that local and national sentiment was for the removal of Japanese from coastal regions along the Pacific coast yet the paper still does not yet overtly call for such measures. Nevertheless, the <i>Star</i> did publish several reports showing life in Japanese interment camps as pleasurable. For example, the January 12th issue reported that &ldquo;Alaska Japs treated well,&rdquo; adding that the life they were said to lead was &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; and the treatment they are receiving is &ldquo;generous.&quot;<a name="_ednref43" title href="#_edn43"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[43]</span></span></a> </span></p>

Although the headline of the later article ran &ldquo;4 Japanese accused of conspiracy,&rdquo; it concluded by saying that a Russian, an Englishman, and Japanese who failed to comply with the alien registration act were also indicted. In other words, although the conspiracy allegedly involved people from several nations, the Japanese were singled out in the headline. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 14th the <i>Seattle Star</i> announced it had been sold to Howard Parish and Associates.

After the sale strikingly different &ldquo;Star Readers Say&rdquo; articles were printed and revealing new sections were added to the paper such as &quot;Japan Unmasked&quot; by Hallet Abend. Gone were the mostly temperate letters and articles calling for tolerance. In their place, the <i>Star</i> became more aggressively anti-Japanese and made fewer distinctions between the Japanese government and military and people of Japanese descent living in the United States. An example of the new type of letters to the editors is showcased in Virginia Scott&rsquo;s comment: </span></p>

The letters to the editor give perhaps the clearest indication of this evolution, which corresponded with the change in ownership of the <i>Seattle Star</i> in January 1942. Overall, the letters went from asking for tolerance towards Japanese residents to calling outright for internment camps and expressing increasing alarm about the threat of Japanese people in the United States. It was this fear, a fear that was directed toward Japanese people in ways that it was not directed toward either German-Americans or Italian-Americans, that led Seattle officials to abridge the rights of Japanese immigrants and Japanese-American citizens and, on a national level, led to Roosevelt&#39;s executive order authorizing wartime internment camps.</span></p>
