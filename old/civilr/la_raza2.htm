	<font size="2">The 
    University of Washington became well known in the late 1960s for student 
    mobilizations that at times rivaled activist hubs such as Berkeley and 
    Columbia. Thousands demonstrated against the war in Vietnam, against 
    militarism on campus, for civil rights. Among the protesters were students 
    of color, primarily African Americans and Chicanos, who created 
    organizations based on race and class and demanded proactive measures to 
    address racial inequality, especially in higher education.</font></font></p>

    students were recruited into the UW for the first time by the Special 
    Education Program, enrolling in the fall of 1968. There they were 
    politically activated by their personal connection to the social problems 
    facing Chicanos in Washington, the momentum of the Civil Rights and farm 
    worker movements, and the milieu of radical student mobilization they found 
    on campus. They formed the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), which 
    joined and soon led a campaign in solidarity with one of the Chicano 
    Movement’s central activities: the boycott of California table grapes in 
    support of the United Farm Worker Organizing Committee (UFWOC), which had 
    been on strike since 1965.</font></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper 
    will attempt to show that as the UFWOC grape boycott helped galvanize the 
    nascent Chicano Movement on a national scale, the UW boycott effort also 
    helped define and empower UMAS in its early stages. The first rumblings of 
    the campus grape debate began before UMAS came to be, and were attributed to 
    non-Chicano activists by the <i>University of Washington Daily. </i>Soon, 
    however, the campaign’s leadership became identified with UMAS, as the 
    organization gained strength and the campaign moved into its most publicized 
    and intense period: a boycott of all UW food services, which centered around 
    the student union building, known as “the HUB.” The successful boycott made 
    the UW the first campus in the United States to stop selling grapes</font><a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[2]</font></span></span></a><font size="2">

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In May of 
    1968, the UW chapter of the Black Student Union (BSU) waged a successful 
    campaign to make the University more accessible and relevant to 
    African-American students. Their vociferous demands, delivered during a 
    four-hour sit-in at the Administration Building, called for improving 
    recruitment and treatment of minority students, doubling Black enrollment, 
    increasing financial aid and funding for minority student programs, and the 
    creation of Black Studies courses.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the 
    steps President Charles Odegaard took in response was to create the Special 
    Education Program (SEP).<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
    The program’s goal was to “increase the enrollment of historically 
    underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students” and provide them 
    assistance with academics and adjusting to the university environment.
    <a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">
    <span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">
    [6]</span></span></a> In June, Bill Hilliard, a former counselor for the 
    Department of Penal Institutions and the YMCA,<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
    was hired to direct recruitment efforts. That summer, he was assisted by 
    eight BSU members who accompanied him on trips around the state to convince 
    “Negro,” “American Indian,” and Mexican-American students to attend the UW.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
    One of the group’s recruiting sites was the Yakima Valley, where recruiters 
    talked with many Chicano youth.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a> 
    This connection between the BSU and Chicano students would later be 
    strengthened by collaborative efforts on campus.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new 
    program was successful in enrolling 247 new students of color,<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> 
    including 35 Chicanos.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a> 
    This brought the total “Hispanic”<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a> 
    population to 60, or 0.19% of the student body of 31,913.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    Before 1968, the UW’s only census of students by ethnicity had been an 
    estimation based on observing students on the Suzzallo Quad (today’s Red 
    Square), but one administrator guesses there was a total of 15-20 Hispanic 
    students before recruiting began.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a> 
    Tomás Ybarra-Frausto, who would become a friend and advisor to many Chicano 
    students, claimed that before SEP there were only three.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a> 
    By any estimation, Chicanos made up only a tiny fraction of the student 
    population, even after the implementation of a recruitment program.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attending a 
    large university can be a daunting experience for any first-year student, 
    and this was perhaps especially true for Chicanos from east of the Cascade 
    Range. Erasmo Gamboa, who would later become a Chicano student leader,<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a> 
    was intimidated by the fact that “there were more people in the HUB than 
    there were in my hometown.” Overwhelmed by the size of campus, he skipped 
    his first day of classes, and happened upon other Chicano students in a 
    U-District coffee shop who were doing the same. Most Chicano students felt 
    isolated, even from each other,&nbsp; because they came from different 
    communities and were spread out in residence halls across the campus. 
    However, some of them quickly recognized their common bonds of culture, 
    ethnicity and class. They shared Mexican roots, spoke Spanish, and came from 
    families that engaged in farm work or other labor.<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    They adopted a buddy system to keep tabs on each other and began building a 
    social network that would soon evolve into an influential organization.<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1968, 
    the UW, like college campuses across the nation and overseas, was embroiled 
    in social upheaval. Student movements and the police and legal actions that 
    countered them reached a fever pitch in Europe, Mexico, and across the 
    United States. In the spring, the UW chapter of Students for a Democratic 
    Society (SDS) participated in a national campaign of protests, including a 
    class boycott waged by more than 2,000 students. In August, Chicago police 
    viciously attacked protesters at the Democratic National Convention, and the 
    City of Berkeley declared a “civil disaster” as police and protesters 
    clashed in the streets. On September 18, someone set fire to UW’s Clark 
    Hall, which housed the Navy ROTC program, and on October 24, 2,000 UW 
    students “liberated” the Faculty Club after a speech given on campus by 
    Yippie organizer Jerry Rubin.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    These are only a few of the tumultuous events that helped set a militant 
    tone for political student organizations.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet 
    Chicanos had even more reason to become politically active than the average 
    student, because a movement of their own was gaining strength. Many 
    political and social organizations had been created during the “Mexican 
    American Generation” of the 1930s. These were focused on the concepts of 
    assimilation into American culture while maintaining pride in Mexican 
    heritage.<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a> 
    By 1968, the ideology and tactics of Mexican American activism had changed. 
    That year, California’s university campuses were home to about 50 Mexican 
    American student organizations, with thousands of members, many of whom were 
    undergoing an acute radicalization.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
    On the morning of March 3, 1968, more than one thousand students walked out 
    of Abraham Lincoln High School in East Los Angeles, protesting the school’s 
    racist teachers and policies, restrictions on students’ freedom of speech, 
    and the lack of Mexican American teachers and curricula. By that afternoon, 
    more than 10,000 students from five other primarily Mexican American schools 
    had joined them.<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a> 
    As author Carlos Muñoz puts it, “In addition to its historical significance 
    to Mexican Americans as their first large-scale protest, the strike marked 
    the entry by youth of Mexican descent into the history of the turbulent 
    sixties.”<a name="_ednref23" title href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a> 
    According to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> , this was the “Birth of Brown 
    Power.”<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The founding of UMAS</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was 
    no organization for Chicanos or Latinos at the UW in the fall of 1968, but 
    Gamboa was accepted as a member of the BSU, whose activities became an 
    inspiration and blueprint for the new Chicano organization soon to form.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a> 
    Little more than a month after the academic year began, Gamboa and others 
    organized the United Mexican American Students (UMAS). The group was also 
    modeled after the UMAS at University of Southern California-Los Angeles, 
    which was helping organize new chapters around the country. The first UW 
    UMAS meeting, on November 1, 1968,<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a> 
    was held in the Lander Hall dormitory, which would later become a hub of 
    social and political activity for the group and other students in SEP.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new 
    group’s first activity was to find a room of its own. UMAS members demanded 
    and received a meeting place, an old barber shop recently purchased by the 
    UW.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    Later in the quarter it established itself as an organization affiliated 
    with the Associated Students of the UW (ASUW), the “student government.” 
    With ASUW recognition,&nbsp; the group was eligible for an office cubicle in the 
    HUB’s second floor “activities lounge,” as well as access to a telephone and 
    mimeograph machine. By the end of the first quarter, UMAS members had 
    convinced both the College of Arts and Sciences to offer a new class on 
    Mexican American History, and the Department of Romance Languages to create 
    a Spanish grammar course especially for native speakers.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UMAS was 
    also building ties with Mexican Americans back in the Yakima Valley. Members 
    went home on weekends to register and educate voters,<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[30]</span></span></a> 
    and even before UMAS was officially organized, they participated in a campus 
    clothing drive for the Yakima Parent-Child Service.<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[31]</span></span></a> 
    In the autumn of 1968, an invitation to join the board of the Mexican 
    American Federation, organized by 40 Mexican Americans in Yakima the year 
    before, was extended to UMAS.<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[32]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We were 
    moving in a sense at breakneck speed, then,” recalls Erasmo Gamboa. “And we 
    were energized by the fact that the University at the time was pliant, if 
    you will — we were able to move the University relatively easy.” It was this 
    energy and desire for change that would soon bring UMAS to its toughest 
    project: convincing the University to stop selling grapes.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>UFWOC and the grape 
    boycott</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1962, 
    the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) had been building rank-and-file 
    strength in various agricultural areas of California, and gaining a national 
    reputation for its nonviolent but gutsy tactics. Since farm workers were not 
    (and are not today) covered by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA, also 
    known as the Wagner Act), the federal law that protects most workers’ rights 
    to organize unions and bargain collectively, cofounder César Chávez and his 
    allies knew that traditional union organizing methods would not work in the 
    fields. They planned to build the union’s strength over many years, until 
    they had the funds and organizational capacity to take on growers, one by 
    one, and win the kind of contracts that would make a significant impact on 
    farm workers’ lives. Due to the pressing need for public support and his own 
    dedication to nonviolence, Chávez cultivated the image of the union as a 
    participant in the Civil Rights movement. He employed a combination of 
    grassroots organizing, Ghandian fasts, solemn marches like those of Dr. 
    Martin Luther King, and imagery and prayer from the Catholic faith.<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[33]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a 
    winning a wage increase for rose workers in 1965 and contracts for 
    wine-grape workers in 1966, the NFWA merged with the Agricultural Workers 
    Organizing Committee (AWOC) to form the United Farm Workers Organizing 
    Committee (UFWOC). UFWOC<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[34]</span></span></a> 
    soon decided to take on the huge table-grape industry, beginning with 
    Giumarra Vineyards Corporation, the largest table-grape grower in the 
    country. Owner John Giumarra swore his fields would never be unionized, so 
    UFWOC organized a national boycott of Giumarra grapes. Despite great 
    investments made by organizers and support committees across the country, 
    Giumarra was able to get around the boycott by illegally using the packing 
    labels of other table grape companies, which allowed “scab grapes” to sneak 
    past supermarket pickets. Once UFWOC found out about this, it decided to 
    boycott all California table grapes, since other growers had proven 
    themselves to be complicit in Giumarra’s strikebreaking.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boycott 
    of table grapes lasted four years. It brought the issue of injustice against 
    Mexican Americans to the nation’s attention and involved many hundreds of 
    volunteers across the country, radicalizing and training them in grassroots 
    organizing. Although the “Friends of the Farm Workers” committees, as they 
    were often called, were multi-ethnic groups,&nbsp; they gave a boost to the 
    Chicano Movement, especially its student activists. UFWOC organizers were 
    dispatched to every major city in the nation. Dale Van Pelt, a Methodist 
    minister and UFWOC organizer,<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[35]</span></span></a> 
    arrived to Seattle in the winter of 1968-69 and began working with UMAS, 
    training its members in strategy and organizing skills, while coordinating 
    boycott efforts among church groups, unions, and other organizations.<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[36]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
    boycott also gave the movement new icons and cultural traditions, such as a 
    new form of agit-prop “teatro” theater created by Teatro Campesino, which 
    worked closely with the union. The UFWOC flag, an angular Aztec eagle on a 
    red background, became a sort of Chicano coat-of-arms. Its significance to 
    UMAS would later be captured by a <i>Daily</i> photograph of four UMAS 
    students holding the flag, with a caption that calls it “their Huelga banner 
    ... used to symbolize the cause of the Mexican-American farm workers 
    throughout the country.”<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></a></font></p>

    <font face="Arial"><font size="2">Exactly how the boycott began at the UW 
    remains unclear. In the beginning, <i>the Daily </i>&nbsp;reported that it was 
    led by the combined efforts of the UW chapters of the Young Men’s and Young 
    Women’s Christian Associations (YMCA &amp; YWCA). Mostly Anglo</font><a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline"><font size="2">[38]</font></span></span></a><font size="2">

    However, according to one of the boycott’s central participants, Erasmo

    It is entirely plausible that <i>the Daily </i>&nbsp;might have ignored the 
    contributions of a small group of nonwhite students, but resolving this 
    question would take further research. In any case, it is clear that there 
    was significant participation of non-Chicano students in the preliminary 
    boycott activities, but that at a certain point, UMAS became the visible 
    leader.</font></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end 
    of September 1968, the supermarket chain A&amp;P had agreed to halt local grape 
    sales and UFWOC was claming a national drop in grape sales of 20 per cent. 
    That week, the UW YMCA issued a position paper calling for a grape boycott 
    on campus, starting with residence hall cafeterias.<a name="_ednref41" title href="#_edn41"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[41]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    By October 1, food services director J. Arthur Pringle announced that 
    dormitory residents would decide for themselves whether to boycott grapes, 
    calling it “an individual matter instead of an institutional one.”<a name="_ednref42" title href="#_edn42"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[42]</span></span></a> 
    This would become the administration’s position on the matter for the 
    duration of the grape struggle. As a state institution, administrators said, 
    the UW was not in a position to take stances on political issues. Selling 
    scab grapes, boycotters countered, was in itself taking a political position 
    in favor of grape growers.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On October 
    8, the student-run Residence Hall Council (RHC) was urged by YM-YWCA to 
    support the boycott,<a name="_ednref43" title href="#_edn43"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[43]</span></span></a> 
    and it decided to allow each individual hall decide for itself. A vote was 
    scheduled for October 21, and the film “Huelga” was shown by the campus 
    chapter of the National Grape Boycott Committee five nights of the week 
    leading up to the vote.<a name="_ednref44" title href="#_edn44"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[44]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    Residents of each of the dorms weighed in overwhelmingly in favor of the 
    boycott: Terry-Lander Hall voted 378 for-189 against, Haggett 361-200, 
    Hansee 111-53, and McCarty 294-94. <a name="_ednref45" title href="#_edn45">

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; November 
    14-18, John Azelle, campus chair of the National Grape Boycott Committee,<a name="_ednref46" title href="#_edn46"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[46]</span></span></a> 
    and three other UW students took part in a four-day fast in support of the 
    strikers in California. Their fast began with an all-night vigil in front of 
    a Seattle franchise of the Albertson’s supermarket chain, which was a target 
    for boycott actions off campus.<a name="_ednref47" title href="#_edn47"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[47]</span></span></a> 
    (Although Quality Food Centers and A&amp;P stores throughout the Seattle area 
    had discontinued grape sales, Albertson’s was one of the chains whose line 
    was “let the consumer decide.”)<a name="_ednref48" title href="#_edn48"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[48]</span></span></a> 
    The five hunger strikers<a name="_ednref49" title href="#_edn49"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[49]</span></span></a> 
    spent the rest of the four days at the Luther House in the U-District, 
    ending their fast with the breaking of bread. It is useful to note that 
    religious symbolism and sentiment had spread from the nonviolent leaders of 
    Delano to supporters throughout the movement, including students; and that 
    the names of the participants as reported by <i>the Daily</i> indicate that 
    the YM-YWCA was not predominantly Chicano. UMAS had formed just days 
    earlier, and though the record does not show its members as major 
    participants up to this point, they would soon be taking the lead.

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 
    residence hall vote and the well-publicized fast, the boycott’s opponents 
    decided to get organized too. The Young Republicans (YRs), staunchly opposed 
    to the secondary boycott they deemed “illegal,”<a name="_ednref50" title href="#_edn50"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[50]</span></a> 
    hosted a presentation by three grape growers from Delano, California, on 
    January 10. They faced off with Dale Van Pelt and a sizeable group of&nbsp; 
    boycott supporters, turning up the heat between the YRs and their opponents.<a name="_ednref51" title href="#_edn51"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[51]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HUB had 
    sold grapes intermittently for a number of years,<a name="_ednref52" title href="#_edn52"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[52]</span></span></a> 
    and at some point in January, grapes went back on sale after a request from 
    YRs Richard Sanders<a name="_ednref53" title href="#_edn53"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[53]</span></span></a> 
    and Bob Lint. On January 16, 1969, a group of SDS members<a name="_ednref54" title href="#_edn54"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[54]</span></span></a> 
    noticed that grapes were on sale in one of the HUB’s food facilities, and 
    presented an ultimatum to John Bickford, assistant HUB manager. They told 
    him that if grapes were not immediately removed by management, they would be 
    “confiscated.” Bickford explained to <i>the Daily</i> that “Our general rule 
    is to play it cool ... [s]o we removed the grapes and called a HUB Advisory 
    Board meeting to suggest that hearings be held to determine a policy for the 
    HUB food services to follow.” Sanders called it “give-in politics” 
    manipulated by “screaming militants,” and fired off a telegram to Governor 
    Daniel Evans, requesting his intervention. Amidst heated demands from both 
    the right and the left, the special Advisory Board meeting was set for the 
    next Wednesday, January 22.<a name="_ednref55" title href="#_edn55"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[55]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the 
    heat of the issue would not allow a week to go by without incident. The day 
    after the SDS ultimatum, a scuffle broke out between members of the YRs and 
    the SDS. The Republicans set up a literature table in the HUB, including 
    leaflets against the grape boycott. SDS members tried to stop them, and the 
    ensuing “fracas” put them on the front page of <i>the Daily</i> and in hot 
    water with John Bickford, who threatened to suspend them all. The 
    Republicans showed that the leftists were not the only demanding ones, by 
    issuing an open letter calling for the suspension of John Bickford and the 
    resignation of UW President Charles Odegaard “unless he agrees to protect 
    the individual liberties of non-militant students.”<a name="_ednref56" title href="#_edn56"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[56]</span></a>&nbsp;

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By late 
    January, UMAS had developed a presence on campus. In less than three months, 
    the small group of newcomers had gained the confidence and organizing skills 
    to assume the leadership of the boycott and make themselves heard throughout 
    the city. The <i>Seattle Times</i> wrote about the UW grape issue, including 
    references to UMAS as the leading organization and quotes from both 
    Guadalupe Gamboa and President Jesús Lemos.<a name="_ednref57" title href="#_edn57"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[57]</span></span></a>

    in addition to the boycott stories it published at least weekly.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday, 
    January 21, UMAS held a press conference in Lander Hall, where Guadalupe 
    Gamboa, a first-year law student and UMAS Minister of Education,<a name="_ednref61" title href="#_edn61"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[61]</span></span></a> 
    read a statement condemning the sale of California grapes on campus. He 
    read:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The time has come when 
    the University should show more concern and responsibility toward poverty 
    than merely studying it .... We, the Mexican-Americans, being largely of 
    farm-worker families, identify completely with the strikers and thus we are 
    the real issue at stake. Not grapes. Will we be denied the basic 
    labor-economic rights and thus the consequent socio-political influences 
    that emanate therefrom?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a 
    question and answer session, BSU leader E.J. Brisker expressed his support 
    for UMAS. “These guys have a lot of guts and they have the whole-hearted 
    support of the BSU. As we see it, the main role of the BSU [in the boycott 
    effort] is to support and advise the UMAS group.”<a name="_ednref62" title href="#_edn62"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[62]</span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same 
    night, the newly-formed ASUW Student Assembly<a name="_ednref63" title href="#_edn63"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[63]</span></span></a> 
    weighed the issue. As <i>the Daily</i> reports it, the discussion boiled 
    down to the essential arguments of the opposing sides: Erasmo Gamboa 
    introduced a bill recommending a ban of grape sales in the HUB, arguing that 
    a lack of action meant tacit support for labor exploitation; Richard Sanders 
    offered an alternative bill, leaving the question up to individual choice. 
    The Assembly resolved with a two-thirds majority that no grapes be sold in 
    the HUB. It was the nascent body’s first resolution, and was forwarded on to 
    the HUB Advisory Board.<a name="_ednref64" title href="#_edn64"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[64]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    Advisory Board met the next night to hear testimony before recommending a 
    course of action to HUB manager Steve Nord. The meeting, described as 
    “stormy at times,” was attended by about 150 people.<a name="_ednref65" title href="#_edn65"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[65]</span></span></a> 
    The Board heard arguments from both sides, including statements from 
    representatives Richard Sanders and Erasmo Gamboa. Sanders presented a 
    petition against the boycott, signed by 250 students and “just put out to be 
    signed today.” Don MacKinnon presented the Student Assembly’s resolution in 
    favor of the ban. At least one union representative was on hand to stand in 
    solidarity with grape workers: George Starkovich, a UW gardener and member 
    of AFL-CIO Local 1488, “drew the biggest ovation of the night when he told 
    the crowd and the board .... ‘We are either for the grape growers or the 
    grape workers. Take your choice.’”<a name="_ednref66" title href="#_edn66"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[66]</span></span></a> 
    The next day, the Advisory Board recommended to Steve Nord that grapes be 
    served in the HUB only to students who specifically ordered them and paid in 
    advance, and it expressed its support of “the plight of the migrant worker 
    in the California grape fields.” Nord then punted, passing the decision on 
    to his superiors.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State 
    assistant Attorney General Jim Wilson accepted a request to meet on January 
    24 with four members of the Advisory Board, including Larry Gossett,<a name="_ednref67" title href="#_edn67"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[67]</span></span></a> 
    a member of the BSU.<a name="_ednref68" title href="#_edn68"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[68]</span></span></a> 
    Wilson told them “the University as a state institution cannot take a 
    political position on the matter” of HUB grape sales, but that “a decision 
    could be made not to buy grapes if the decision was based on such day-to-day 
    factors as price and demand .... [I]f the University discontinues sales 
    because it is losing money by selling them then it is no longer a political 
    decision.” Leaders of the Grape Boycott Committee<a name="_ednref69" title href="#_edn69"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[69]</span></span></a> 
    must have paid close attention to the statement, from the University’s chief 
    legal advisor.<a name="_ednref70" title href="#_edn70"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[70]</span></span></a> 
    Considering the intense energy and dedication of the students involved, and 
    their exhaustive attempts to use administrative measures to rid the HUB of 
    grapes, Wilson was practically begging them to find a way to bring down HUB 
    sales. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concern 
    about the grape boycott had clearly reached the highest levels of the 
    University administration. The same night, President Odegaard attended a 
    Faculty Senate meeting, where a discussion of the boycott was on the agenda. 
    He warned professors to carefully deliberate the issue, and not “shoot from 
    the hip.”<a name="_ednref71" title href="#_edn71"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[71]</span></a> 
    Also on January 24, SDS formally endorsed the boycott with a unanimous vote. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days 
    later, on Monday, January 27, the administration’s ruling came down. Ernest 
    M. Conrad, Vice President for Business and Finance, mandated the free sale 
    of grapes in the HUB, contrary to the HUB Advisory Board’s recommendations.<a name="_ednref72" title href="#_edn72"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[72]</span></span></a> 
    Having exhausted all official channels in their effort to rid the campus of 
    California table grapes, student organizers realized that the gig was up. 
    “We knew that the University wouldn’t act politically,” one UMAS member said 
    later, “but we hoped that they could make an economic decision.” The HUB 
    boycott was on.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Push comes to shove: 
    the HUB boycott</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various 
    student groups reacted quickly to the administration’s decision. UMAS met 
    the same night and called for a complete boycott of campus food services, 
    including “the HUB Cafeteria, the Husky Den, Evergreen Room, Husky Hollow, 
    Commons Cafeteria (Raitt Hall), and the sandwich machine in the 
    snack-o-teria.”<a name="_ednref73" title href="#_edn73"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[73]</span></a> 
    SDS met the next afternoon, and the<i> Daily</i> reported SDS’s support for 
    UMAS “whatever course of action it takes.”<a name="_ednref74" title href="#_edn74"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[74]</span></a> 
    The Student Assembly met that evening, and voted to actively support the HUB 
    food boycott.<a name="_ednref75" title href="#_edn75"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[75]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next 
    morning, Wednesday, January 29, about 100 people began picketing the HUB at 
    11 a.m. The boycott organizers’ immediate goal was to bring down HUB food 
    sales by 10%, the loss they estimated would convince management to remove 
    the grapes altogether. Students passed out food in an effort to prevent 
    hungry, hurried students from crossing the picket line,<a name="_ednref76" title href="#_edn76"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[76]</span></span></a> 
    and planned a teach-in in the HUB Ballroom to convince the uncertain.<a name="_ednref77" title href="#_edn77"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[77]</span></span></a>
    <i>The Daily</i> defended “the University’s right to remain apolitical” 
    while cheering on the boycotters in their effort to force the administration 
    into action.<a name="_ednref78" title href="#_edn78"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[78]</span></span></a> 
    ASUW President Thom Gunn reaffirmed his association’s support for the HUB 
    food boycott and attacked UW Vice President Conrad and President Odegaard 
    for “belittling this university committee [the HUB Advisory Board] ...&nbsp; 
    precipitating a crisis and emerging in its own brand of irresponsible 
    confrontation.”<a name="_ednref79" title href="#_edn79"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[79]</span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday 
    night, a formal boycott coalition was formed and a steering committee chosen 
    with representatives from UMAS, SDS, BSU, Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), 
    Black and White Concern (BWC), the University YMCA Boycott Committee, the 
    Student Assembly, and the ASUW Board of Control (BOC).<a name="_ednref80" title href="#_edn80"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[80]</span></span></a> 
    Erasmo Gamboa was appointed Chair of the committee, which today he frankly 
    characterizes as “highly undemocratic.” The coalition agreed to follow the 
    lead of UMAS, the group that knew most about farm workers. “We felt 
    pressured by the far left groups that we were giving in, not going far 
    enough,” but “those organizations tended to defer to us.”<a name="_ednref81" title href="#_edn81"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[81]</span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    committee’s foes were active, too. On the first day of the boycott, 28 
    pounds of grapes sold in the HUB in 45 minutes,<a name="_ednref82" title href="#_edn82"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[82]</span></span></a> 
    presumably because of the YRs’ efforts. Nevertheless, it seemed the boycott 
    might be working. Both the HUB Cafeteria and the Husky Den reported about 
    700 fewer customers than the Wednesday before, and though John Bickford 
    admitted that the number of patrons had dropped significantly, he did not 
    claim to know exactly why.<a name="_ednref83" title href="#_edn83"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[83]</span></span></a> 
    Depending on who was asked, the drop in sales was attributed to widespread 
    support for the boycott, the heavy snowfall that had stuck around since the 
    week before, or the boycotters’ intimidation of would-be HUB patrons.<a name="_ednref84" title href="#_edn84"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[84]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
    Thursday, the Seattle chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union 
    expressed its support for a campus-wide referendum for all faculty, staff, 
    students and administrators to decide the grape boycott issue, as had been 
    recommended previously by the campus chapter.<a name="_ednref85" title href="#_edn85"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[85]</span></span></a> 
    Meanwhile, boycotters gave out 1,500 peanut butter sandwiches to ward off 
    would-be HUB patrons, and worked into the night to prepare more.<a name="_ednref86" title href="#_edn86"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[86]</span></span></a> 
    The ASUW Board of Control passed a resolution condemning the administration 
    for “blatant disregard of student opinion and decision making,”<a name="_ednref87" title href="#_edn87"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[87]</span></a> 
    and on Friday, it allocated $150 from its emergency fund to the YMCA Boycott 
    Committee for more PB&amp;J.<a name="_ednref88" title href="#_edn88"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[88]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 
    3, Day Four of the boycott, hard numbers were released that were hard to 
    ignore. When combined, the average sales of the Husky Den and the HUB 
    Cafeteria had repeatedly dropped $831 each day of the boycott and their 
    customer count went down in average daily slumps of 1,745. The boycott had 
    far surpassed the goal of reducing HUB food sales by 10% — average daily 
    sales had dropped 18% in the Husky Den and 24% in the HUB Cafeteria. That 
    day, the boycotters also received a favorable resolution from the UW chapter 
    of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP).</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Yet the boycott’s early successes were 
    tempered by logistical setbacks. Seattle health officials shut down the 
    peanut butter sandwich brigades because volunteers didn’t have the required 
    food handler’s permits, and HUB manager Steve Nord cautioned the YMCA 
    University Boycott Committee that they were not allowed to use HUB 
    kitchenettes for public food service. “It was not an effort to squash the 
    boycott,” he said, “but we have to follow the proper health and sanitation 
    procedures.”<a name="_ednref89" title href="#_edn89"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[89]</span></a> 
    Considering the to-the-letter nature of today’s HUB administration, Nord’s 
    denial of political motivation was quite possibly sincere.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 
    fifth day of the boycott, Tuesday, the situation seemed to be progressing. 
    ASUW officers traveled to Olympia to discuss the boycott with legislators, 
    and reported a favorable reception from lawmakers who encouraged them to 
    remain moderate. The boycott executive committee delivered a letter to 
    President Odegaard asking for a definitive decision from him by Thursday.<a name="_ednref90" title href="#_edn90"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[90]</span></span></a> 
    Instead, the administration agreed only to a meeting with students on that 
    day.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most signs 
    were positive for the boycott one week after it had begun. On February 5, 
    the HUB Advisory Board unanimously passed a resolution to immediately stop 
    selling grapes, and Nord intimated that the resolution might be presented to 
    the administration in a coming meeting between administrators, faculty and 
    students. The list of organizations endorsing the boycott effort had grown 
    long: UMAS, BSU, SDS, YSA, BWC, University YMCA Boycott Committee, Student 
    Assembly, officers of the ASUW, BOC, Graduate and Professional Student 
    Senate (GPSS), AAUP, 74 independent faculty members and the Inter-Fraternity 
    Council.<a name="_ednref91" title href="#_edn91"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[91]</span></span></a> 
    Soon after, the Residence Hall Council added its name to the list.<a name="_ednref92" title href="#_edn92"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[92]</span></span></a>Only 
    the YRs and the New Conservatives actively opposed the boycott, and 
    Assistant Attorney General Jim Wilson affirmed the legality of the ASUW’s 
    $150 allocation to the central boycott committee, stating that secondary 
    boycotts were illegal only if staged by labor unions covered by the NLRA.<a name="_ednref93" title href="#_edn93"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[93]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A convoluted 
    compromise</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    Thursday summit between the administration, UMAS, and the YRs was 
    inconclusive, but at least a proposal for compromise came out of it. The 
    ACLU’s simple suggestion of a campus referendum was dismissed because of the 
    time it would take to set up,<a name="_ednref94" title href="#_edn94"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[94]</span></span></a> 
    but two ASUW officers suggested another way to decide the issue: a 
    moratorium on both the sale of grapes and the HUB boycott, as well as a 
    period of sales assessment to equal the time the HUB boycott had been going 
    on.<a name="_ednref95" title href="#_edn95"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[95]</span></span></a> 
    The YRs called the idea “the most ridiculous proposal heard today,” but it 
    was the only proposal made at the reportedly unruly face-off.<a name="_ednref96" title href="#_edn96"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[96]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday, 
    February 7, saw the publication of an open letter from President Odegaard in
    <i>the Daily.</i> Odegaard, who was out of town, expressed virtually the 
    same sentiments as the conservative opponents of the boycott and the 
    supermarket chains that kept selling grapes: the matter was one of 
    individual choice. He took an ideological stance against the methods of the 
    boycotters while claiming to respect their aims. He wrote: “Unfortunately, 
    there are those who would use any plausible cause as an excuse to abuse the 
    University when their basic goal is the wrecking of the very society which 
    the Mexican Americans wish to join more fully.” He also warned that 
    “[t]yranny easily takes over a people who have already let the safeguards of 
    their individual freedoms be eroded by sloth or folly in a succession of 
    individual cases,” citing&nbsp; Hitler’s rise to power as an example.<a name="_ednref97" title href="#_edn97"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[97]</span></span></a><b>&nbsp;
    </b>How a University president could get away with comparing the Third Reich 
    with college students advocating on behalf of farmworkers is hard to fathom, 
    but I believe this a telling example of the administration’s perspective. 
    Only those absolutely mired in the status quo would think to link the 
    nonviolent disruption of commerce with the systematic dismantling of civil 
    liberties that Germany saw in the 1930s.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same 
    Friday, Vice President Frederick Thieme announced that indeed grapes would 
    be removed from HUB shelves while a before-and-after study of sales was 
    conducted. Average sales for two weeks in February would be compared with 
    average sales from Jan. 6-28, the weeks leading up to the boycott. If total 
    sales increased during the test case, grapes would remain off the shelves. 
    If sales decreased, grape sales would resume. If figures remained roughly 
    the same, grapes would be made available to those students who ordered and 
    paid for them in advance. The full rationale of this plan is never made 
    clear in <i>the Daily’s</i> coverage (possibly because it so puzzled 
    reporters) and none of the boycott participants interviewed for this paper 
    could remember its obtuse details. It appears that the plan was meant pacify 
    all sides of the conflict, and somehow demonstrate to the administration 
    whether or not the student body supported the boycott. It was a 
    “cooling-off” period. But was it also a cop-out by the administration?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </b>The YRs would be allowed the chance to 
    stage their own boycott of the HUB during the “statistical phase,” and would 
    be allocated the same $150 from the ASUW that grape boycotters received, if 
    requested. Thus, in a sense, the YRs were being asked to prove that their 
    cause also had student support, and barring such proof, grape sales would 
    not resume. They refused to mount a counter-boycott, not wanting to “roll in 
    the gutter with the administration.”<a name="_ednref98" title href="#_edn98"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[98]</span></a> 
    The convoluted situation was perhaps best summed up by John Greely, the<i> 
    Daily’s&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;verbose grape correspondent:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 10px"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Thus, at this point of the 
    grape issue, a controversy whose beginnings on this campus are shrouded with 
    placards and angry words and whose end is not yet in sight, there is a 
    curious state of bewilderment. Each student faction, although of opposite 
    idealogy [sic] and intent, in this issue, is dissatisfied with the decision.</font></p>
    <p class="longquote" style="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-left:10px">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">One group refuses to 
    boycott, explaining that boycotting is contrary to their principle. The 
    other feels that they have made themselves clear on the issue, but wishes 
    that others would do so also. The administration will rely on statistics to 
    save face. </font> </p>
    <p class="longquote" style="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-left:10px">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">The irony of the situation: 
    grapes will soon be out of season and the HUB couldn’t buy them even if they 
    wanted to. <a name="_ednref99" title href="#_edn99">

    <span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Greely 
    would later point out, the “Mosier Plan” was heavily weighted in the 
    boycotters’ favor. The plan’s namesake was an officer of the ASUW, a body 
    that had overwhelmingly come out in support of the grape strikers and their 
    student foot soldiers,<a name="_ednref100" title href="#_edn100"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[100]</span></span></a> 
    and the YRs knew it. But despite the YRs’ aversion to dirtying their hands 
    in the affair, they accepted $150 from the ASUW on Feb. 11 for their 
    campaign to restart HUB grape sales. Richard Sanders received the funds on 
    behalf of a committee known as Students For Responsible Expression (SRE), 
    which he said would use to produce literature and <i>Daily</i> 
    advertisements. As with the arrangement providing $150 to grape boycotters, 
    SRE was required to repay the amount in full, and said it would accept 
    donations to recoup costs.<a name="_ednref101" title href="#_edn101"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[101]</span></span></a>
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, 
    the University Boycott Committee wasn’t through yet. On February 12, it 
    hosted a talk by Fred Ross,<a name="_ednref102" title href="#_edn102"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[102]</span></span></a> 
    the Community Services Organization leader who had trained César Chávez as 
    an organizer.<a name="_ednref103" title href="#_edn103"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[103]</span></span></a> 
    He spoke to 34 students at the University YMCA, outlining UFWOC’s goal now 
    that grape season was ending and new projects could be begun: to stop grape 
    sales at Safeway, the supermarket giant.<a name="_ednref104" title href="#_edn104"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[104]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not 
    surprisingly, HUB food sales increased during the moratorium, once the 
    boycott was called off. To the delight of boycott supporters, sales jumped 
    18% during the first three days of the moratorium when compared with the 
    corresponding days of the previous week.<a name="_ednref105" title href="#_edn105"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[105]</span></span></a> 
    With those figures established, the Student Assembly seemed ready to salve 
    wounds and move on, passing a resolution February 11 that commended John 
    Bickford for his “fair and sensitive response” to the difficulties of the 
    grape boycott.<a name="_ednref106" title href="#_edn106"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[106]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, 
    finally, the boycott came to an anticlimactic end. On Monday, February 17, 
    1969, the HUB&nbsp; halted the sale of&nbsp; grapes and the administration announced 
    “that California table grapes will not be sold in the building for the 
    balance of the season.” The Students for Responsible Expression reacted with 
    a sardonic protest: members gave away grapes at all entrances of the HUB, 
    beneath placards reading “Purple Power” and “Grapes Is Beautiful.” They 
    disposed of three lugs of fruit, donated by local food markets, and claimed 
    to have gathered 1,000 signatures in favor of resuming grape sales.<a name="_ednref107" title href="#_edn107"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[107]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UMAS and 
    other boycotters were undoubtedly pleased with the administration’s 
    announcement. “We set out to get grapes off the HUB food lines and that’s 
    just what we did. So I guess you could call that a victory,” Jesús Lemos 
    said.<a name="_ednref108" title href="#_edn108"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[108]</span></span></a> 
    “The campus was ‘clean,’ as we used the language of the time,” said Erasmo 
    Gamboa in a recent interview.<a name="_ednref109" title href="#_edn109"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[109]</span></span></a> 
    Thom Gunn was more reluctant to claim a complete victory. “However,” he 
    said, “I certainly hope that a lot of the previously side line groups are 
    proud of their involvement in the controversy. In the future I hope these 
    same groups will continue to make their feelings known.”<a name="_ednref110" title href="#_edn110"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[110]</span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;<b>Conclusion: the 
    boycott’s results</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    national boycott eventually succeeded in forcing all the major California 
    table grape growers to the negotiating table in the spring and summer of 
    1970. The UW grape boycott, however, was more than just a small victory 
    within a larger movement. In addition to reaching its objective of ridding 
    the campus of scab fruit, UMAS had become a force in campus politics, 
    despite its few members. It had given a voice to Chicano students, who were 
    then able to advocate on their own behalf within the University, as well as 
    bring to light the injustices suffered by Washington’s Mexican Americans, 
    who had been largely invisible to city folk until this period.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Daily</i> 
    Editor Ray Hallinan observed in a March 1969 editorial that “it seems likely 
    that the grape boycott was the issue which began to awaken this campus from 
    a long apathetic slumber. This was a very positive step.”<a name="_ednref111" title href="#_edn111"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[111]</span></a> 
    While it may seem untrue in retrospect to characterize the campus in 1968-69 
    as apathetic, at least in comparison with how it has been before and since, 
    Hallinan had a point. The grape boycott was the first time that such a broad 
    student coalition (with support from faculty and staff) had challenged the 
    University administration with a compelling political issue in a highly 
    strategic manner, employing all possible channels in order to create a 
    change. The BSU had been successful in creating new opportunities for 
    African Americans and other students of color the year before, but I would 
    argue that their accomplishments were based on the force of their political 
    argument and of their protesting presence, and not as much as the force of 
    coalition. The same is especially true of the SDS. It mobilized thousands of 
    students against the war and drove a United Fruit Company recruiter from 
    campus,<a name="_ednref112" title href="#_edn112"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[112]</span></span></a> 
    among other actions, but its far-left ideology and tactics prevented it from 
    engaging in the kind of dialogue that occasionally creates lasting change 
    within the University.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
    boycott’s organizers, from YMCA to UMAS, were an intelligent bunch, building 
    their campaign from the bottom up. It started in the residence halls, where 
    the boycott could be instituted one building at a time, and where individual 
    residents and floors could be targeted for lobbying. The YM-YWCA quickly 
    convinced the administration to allow students to decide for themselves how 
    to deal with grape sales. This was a surprisingly democratic move, and one 
    which gave the campaign much strength by allowing it an early victory. (From 
    the time the YMCA released its position paper to the landslide vote favoring 
    the boycott in every residence hall, less than a month elapsed.)</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The larger, 
    public food services were an obvious next objective. Although the SDS’s 
    uncompromising demands kicked off the HUB struggle in January, its brawny 
    tactics were not sustainable. SDS members did get the HUB to immediately 
    remove grapes from the shelves with their intimations of sabotage, but that 
    would have continued to work only as long as they were regularly checking 
    the shelves, and the administration was willing to bend to the radicals’ 
    threats. When UMAS stepped in to lead the campaign through the maze of the 
    meetings and strategy revisions, the boycott had an opportunity to really 
    work. This pragmatic spirit of struggle <i>and</i> compromise is no accident 
    — Erasmo Gamboa attributes it to the Chicano students’ economic background 
    and their position as newcomers. While SDS members, largely of the middle 
    and upper-middle class, could count on the economic safety net underlying 
    their daring acts, and BSU radicals often had family and community to count 
    on just a few miles away, UMAS students in urban western Washington were cut 
    off from their support system in the Yakima Valley. Many also recognized 
    their unique opportunity to find a career outside the laborious occupations 
    of their parents, and didn’t want to jeopardize it.<a name="_ednref113" title href="#_edn113"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[113]</span></span></a></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UMAS was 
    smart, dedicated, and inspired by the historical contexts they came from and 
    walked into, but the skills they quickly developed were what really made 
    things happen. UMAS’ media savvy was useful — getting stories run in the <i>
    Seattle Times</i>&nbsp; and constant coverage from <i>the Daily</i> kept the heat 
    on — but its coalition-building, more than anything, was the key to its 
    success. It won the support of a numerous undergraduate associations (BSU, 
    SDS, the ASUW Senate and BOC, just to name the major players), graduate 
    students (GPSS and other groups), faculty (AAUP, Faculty Senate, 
    departments, individuals), religious organizations, and community leaders. 
    This assemblage not only gave more weight to the campaign’s claims, but 
    provided a base of supporters to call on when the boycott and other events 
    developed. The boycotters’ broad-based support and the force of their 
    arguments truly made it a <i>movement,</i> a collective effort that changed 
    the way things worked.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">The boycott was also unique because it 
    engaged the entire campus community. Students from across the political 
    spectrum, <i>the Daily,</i> faculty, staff, and key players in the 
    administration took a public stance on the issue.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">In the months and years following February 
    of 1969, Thom Gunn’s hopes for continued student involvement came true. 
    Boycott supporters kept at it, quickly transferred their efforts from the 
    HUB to local Safeway stores. The next academic year (1969-70) saw the 
    campus’s largest antiwar protests of all, Erasmo Gamboa joined the very HUB 
    Advisory Board he had successfully lobbied from the outside,<a name="_ednref114" title href="#_edn114"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[114]</span></span></a> 
    and in the spring, a Chicano student named Eloy Apodaca was elected to the 
    ASUW Board of Control.<a name="_ednref115" title href="#_edn115"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[115]</span></span></a> 
    Later UMAS changed its name and affiliated with El Movimiento Estudiantil 
    Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA), a group that today continues to engage in campus 
    politics and recruit new Chicano/Latino students.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Afterword: UW 
    student activism, 30 years later</b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a campus 
    activist and student of Spanish and Labor Studies, I chose to research UMAS 
    and the grape boycott because of my own interests in grassroots organizing 
    and Spanish-speaking cultures. Leafing through the pages of old periodicals 
    and learning of the collaborations between BSU, UMAS, SDS, and other groups, 
    has been a bittersweet inspiration to me just as my own participation in 
    similar activities comes to a close. It is my hope that this historical 
    account can serve other student organizers by putting into perspective some 
    of the challenges that any group faces when confronting the University 
    administration. By contrasting the late 1960s with my own era I hope to 
    identify some of the elements that lead to political gains within the 
    constraints particular to this massive, idiosyncratic institution.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It remains 
    exceptionally difficult to convince the University to take a political 
    stand, but the question of the its moral responsibilities regarding labor 
    and human rights has not gone away. State law prevents government employees 
    from advocating or opposing any ballot issue or candidate; the difficulty of 
    getting UW President Richard McCormick to stand up to Initiative 200 is a 
    recent example.<a name="_ednref116" title href="#_edn116"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[116]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
    This restriction doesn’t stop students from trying to pin the UW down on 
    issues that don’t appear on the ballot, however. For example, the 1997-98 
    academic year saw the rise and flop of a new movement to support farm 
    workers. The Strawberry Workers Solidarity Coalition (SWSC), made up of 
    MEChA, Student Labor Action Coalition, Classified Staff District 925/SEIU, 
    and the International Socialist Organization, wanted to support the UFW’s 
    new effort to organize the California strawberry industry, and began 
    planning a campaign to convince the Board of Regents to sign a pledge of 
    support of strawberry workers’ rights, a strategy suggested by the UFW. 
    After months of contentious meetings and little progress, SWSC members 
    realized that its goal was not feasible, and gave up.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">However, another organization was successful 
    in forcing the Regents’ hand, later that year. GPSS and the Free Burma 
    Coalition successfully lobbied the Board of Regents to oppose ARCO (Atlantic 
    Richfield Co.) as a sponsor of the Pac-10 athletics conference, because of 
    the company's financial support of the military regime in Burma. The Regents 
    agreed to write a letter to the conference administrators expressing their 
    disapproval, and though this did not change ARCO’s sponsorship, the move was 
    an important precedent. The Coalition for Domestic Partnership Equality, 
    perhaps the most effective and influential UW student organization this 
    decade, is another success story. In 1997, it convinced the UW to provide 
    the same housing and insurance benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of 
    students that it offers to students’ spouses. Throughout the 1996-97 
    academic year, it waged a campaign the included the gathering of thousands 
    of petition signatures, a sizeable rally and other public events, 
    negotiations with the President and other administrators, and the support of 
    dozens of student organizations, as well as leading gay rights and other 
    activists from the Seattle community. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is 
    reason to believe that another labor or human rights issue could come to the 
    forefront of the campus dialogue. In spring of 1998, student voters 
    overwhelmingly approved an ASUW ballot measure asking if the University 
    should cease doing business with companies that violate workers’ rights. 
    This vote of confidence for proactive steps in commerce and human rights 
    could be a useful wedge if employed by student activists. MEChA continues 
    its support for a boycott in solidarity with Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del 
    Noroeste (PCUN), an Oregon farm worker union, and conversations about 
    joining the national Students Against Sweatshops campaign continue to bubble 
    among various student organizations and, on occasion, in the pages of <i>the 
    Daily.&nbsp; </i>The day will come when students once again attempt to make the 
    University lend its weighty hand to a political cause, and when it does, it 
    will be essential to remember that tremendous pressure will be required.
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In building 
    this kind of momentum, students face more than just the student apathy that 
    the <i>Tyee</i> <i>&nbsp;</i>yearbook complained about even in the late 1960s. 
    The forceful student mobilizations a generation ago ripped from the hands of 
    the administration the control of campus it had always enjoyed. In the 
    intervening years, the UW found ways to take back that control. In 1972, the 
    Use of University Facilities Committee (UUFC) was established, and with it, 
    a set of rules that regulates students’ and others’ use of campus for 
    meetings and events. Today the UUFC requires that a special form be filled 
    out by any organization that plans an event involving amplified sound or 
    participants from off campus. The committee’s rationale is that it needs to 
    prevent the kinds of classroom disruptions that occurred at the sixties’ 
    peak, as well as to ensure that campus facilities are used primarily by the 
    University and its affiliated organizations, not taken over by outside 
    groups. The requirement that the form be filed three weeks in advance of the 
    event, however, limits the kind of rapid-response meetings and events that 
    political student organizations tend to plan. The UUF form also requires the 
    sponsorship and signature of the chair or director of some “relevant” 
    department, which slows down organizers who have to hunt down and convince 
    administrators, who at times refuse to sign for events of a political 
    nature. In any case, why should an academic department have to validate the 
    relevance of student activities?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some 
    point in the 1970s, student organizations were made independent of the ASUW, 
    and were cut off from its resources. In the 1960s, the lounge on the second 
    floor of the HUB, near the ASUW office, housed desks for student 
    organizations.<a name="_ednref117" title href="#_edn117"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-family: Palatino; vertical-align: baseline">[117]</span></span></a> 
    Today the administration keeps “Registered Student Organizations” (RSOs) at 
    arm’s length. They are not allowed to use the resources of the ASUW or the 
    administration’s Student Activities Office (SAO), and are technically not a 
    part of the University at all, but “registered” entities that are allowed 
    limited liberties on campus. Another example of regulations that stifle 
    student organizations is the rules regarding fundraising, an activity only 
    RSOs and the University itself may legally engage in on campus. Even 
    something as simple as setting up a card table and selling T-shirts or baked 
    goods is a burden: it requires a form listing each individual item and 
    price, a meeting with an SAO adviser, permission from the SAO, and another 
    meeting after the fact to show receipts of earnings and a bank deposit. The 
    SAO’s recent claim that this process’s intent is to register fundraisers to 
    ensure that they are not hassled by UW Police does not ring true. It is, at 
    best, a bureaucratic mess that does not take into account the needs of 
    student organizations; at worst, it may be an obstacle intended to keep 
    student groups begging for pocket change.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An 
    important asset of all student organizations is the student union building. 
    Unfortunately, the UW doesn’t have one. The “Husky Union Building” houses 
    the ASUW and GPSS (whose decisions can be overridden at any moment by the UW 
    President, according to their own constitutions), but it is otherwise run 
    like a convention center, with some use relegated to student organizations. 
    Job recruiters find a happy home there, and private conferences are 
    regularly held in the Auditorium and Ballrooms, but few student groups can 
    afford to use the facilities beyond the two free hours of meeting space 
    allowed them each week. A multi-tiered price system discourages fundraisers 
    and events that are open to the general public. For example, either of these 
    conditions makes the cost of an event in the Auditorium jump from about $50 
    to about $250. Closing the circle of this Catch-22 is the rule against ASUW 
    appropriations (which normally can be requested for RSO events) for 
    fundraisers. In effect, students have to hold a fundraiser in order to 
    afford holding a fundraiser. The end result is the marginalization of 
    smaller RSOs, which are overshadowed by groups with access to outside 
    funding and by the large but ineffectual ASUW.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An 
    exploration of these regulations, and of the evolution of student 
    organizations’ relationship to the administration over time, could shed 
    light on the UW’s current sleepy state of student activism. Changes to these 
    regulations could help promote a renewed student movement, one with the 
    confidence and capacity to challenge the administration and produce leaders 
    as strong as some of those mentioned here.</font></p>

        because many such terms were the topic of heated debate during the era 
        that it covers. “Chicano” is a term created in the 1960s by activists of 
        Mexican descent to represent themselves, but was often rejected by 
        moderates who preferred to call themselves “Mexican-Americans.” (See the 
        introduction of Muñoz’s <i>Youth, Identity, Power</i> for a discussion 
        of the term “Chicano.”) I will tend to use the terms “Chicano” to refer 
        to citizens or permanent residents of the United States who are of 
        Mexican descent and who see their ethnicity as a defining factor of 
        their position in society, and “Mexican-American” for any American 
        citizen or resident of Mexican descent. But admittedly, I use them 
        somewhat interchangeably, as with the terms “Black” and 
        “African-American.”</font></font></div>
