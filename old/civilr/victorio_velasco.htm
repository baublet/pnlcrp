	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">When Seattle’s Filipino 
	American community began to develop in the 1920s, one notable characteristic 
	was the heavy use of journalism and writing.&nbsp; In the decades that followed, 
	the community was responsible for the publication of countless journals and 
	newspapers.&nbsp; These publications focused on numerous topics, from labor 
	issues to daily gossip to politics to international issues of concern to the 
	local Filipino population. Through journalism, Seattle's Filipino Americans 
	strengthened their community, explored identity, and organized to overcome 
	obstacles. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoCommentText" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The central figure in 
	Filipino American community journalism in the Northwest was Victorio A. 
	Velasco, who immigrated to the United States in 1924. Velasco edited, wrote, 
	and published more newspapers, newsletters, poems, pamphlets, speeches, and 
	other writings than it is reasonable to outline in detail, and in so doing 
	became, for all intents and purposes, the William Randolph Hearst of 
	Filipino American journalism. Today Velasco is best known for <i>The 
	Filipino Forum, </i>the Seattle-based weekly he founded in 1928 and edited 
	and published until his death in 1968.&nbsp; Mark Mabanag has written a research 
	report for this website on the <i>&quot;Filipino Forum: </i>The Founding Years&quot;&nbsp; 
	and Michael S. Brown has written an important dissertation that serves 
	as a more complete biography of Victorio Velasco. Here I explore Velasco's 
	early years in America and examine the newspapers he wrote for and edited 
	prior to the<i> Filipino Forum.</i> Velasco’s early years help to outline 
	exactly who he was and provide an understanding of how he helped pioneer 
	Filipino American journalism. These years also reveal how Velasco’s views 
	evolved over time, from the mild, apolitical tone of the <i>Philippine 
	Seattle Colonist</i> to the more assertive politics of the <i>Philippine 
	American Review</i>.</font><a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a><font size="2">
	</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Velasco was born in the Philippines in 1902, just four years 
	after the country had had come under US control at the end of the 
	Spanish-American War. Growing up, Velasco learned to write and speak English 
	as a second language. His generation was one of the first to receive an 
	American-style education. He studied at the College of the Philippines in 
	Sampaluc, where he received his Bachelors degree. After graduating he began 
	working for the <i>Manila Tribune</i> and<i> The Philippine</i> <i>Herald</i>, 
	but due to encouragement from American teachers in the Philippines, Velasco 
	decided to come to the U.S. in order to further his education and career.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a> 
	He left the Philippines on April 12th, 1924 and sailed a long route that 
	took him to Eastern China, Hong Kong, Japan and finally, weeks later, to 
	Seattle.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">When Velasco arrived in 
	the United States he did not immediately go to school. He first worked for 
	nearly a year in order to raise enough money to pay for his education. Even 
	though Velasco had more education than the majority of his white 
	counterparts in the United States he was unable to find a job as a 
	journalist due to his race.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a> 
	Instead, he worked in Seattle as a domestic servant and in Alaska in the 
	salmon canneries. The work he received in Seattle was often sporadic and did 
	not pay well. Due to racial stereotypes and discrimination, the only jobs 
	available to even educated Filipinos were positions as houseboys or in 
	various forms of manual labor.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a> 
	Many times he was fired with little to no warning on dubious grounds. As a 
	result, he was forced to rely heavily on cannery work in order to stay ahead 
	on his finances. Although the working conditions in the canneries were often 
	deplorable, Velasco was encouraged by the amount of money he was able to 
	earn in America. On his first trip up to Alaska he wrote in his diary, 
	“Received my first earned dollar in America. Received $7.50 for working ten 
	hours the other day. Was laughing at the easy job and easy money. $7.50 for 
	10 hours! In the Philippines it takes a month for a police man to earn what 
	I did for barely ten hours of easy work. Such is the better prospect of life 
	in this beautiful country.””<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a> 
	Thus, despite the fact that he was being discriminated against and forced to 
	work long, unpleasant hours packing fish, Velasco managed to keep a very 
	positive outlook. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite the barriers 
	posed by racism and financial difficulties, Velasco was determined to become 
	a journalist in America. Unable to find work at any of the mainstream 
	newspapers, Velasco became an editor for the <i>Philippine Seattle Colonist</i>. 
	Published from 1924-1927, the <i>Colonist</i> represents the beginning of a 
	series of papers that document Velasco's maturation and evolution as a 
	writer and a community leader. It was published in Seattle on a weekly to 
	monthly basis and consisted of five to ten pages.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it had a 
	rather small readership, which was unable to support it for very long.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The tone of <i>The 
	Philippine Seattle Colonist</i> was relatively mild in regards to racial 
	inequality, the demands of labor, or the issue of Philippine independence. 
	Although the <i>Colonist </i>professed an interest in confronting these 
	issues, it instead largely skirted them in favor of light Filipino-related 
	community news without any major political substance. The paper's stance on 
	Philippine independence appears to represent a detachment from political 
	conditions there. Considering Velasco's initial patriotic impressions of 
	America and the paper's tenuous financial position, it is easy to see where 
	the conciliatory tone of the paper came from.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">An article on the 
	Filipino holiday of Rizal Day in the January 7, 1927 issue of the <i>
	Colonist</i> provides an example of the paper's timidity on the issue of 
	Philippine independence.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a> 
	Jose Rizal was a brilliant Filipino revolutionary who had written several 
	novels arguing for Philippine independence during the era of Spanish rule. 
	Despite his nonviolent platform, the Spanish had Rizal exiled. During the 
	revolution from Spain, Rizal returned to the Philippines to support 
	nonviolence but was shot for sedition by the Spanish-controlled government. 
	After that point, Rizal became a national hero and an emblem of Philippine 
	independence.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> 
	In an article titled “1926 Rizal Day Biggest Ever,”<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a> 
	the <i>Colonist</i> noted, “The coronation ceremonies were impressive and 
	majestic.&nbsp; After a beautiful selection by the Filipino band of the U.S.S 
	Holland, directed by L.C. Mateo, the sound of trumpets heralded the coming 
	of the queen to her court.”<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a> 
	Not once did the <i>Colonist</i> discuss how the festivities organized by 
	the US navy were symbolic of an act of submission on a day celebrating a man 
	known for his struggle for Philippine independence, or that such an act was 
	analogous to the current relationship between the Philippines and the U.S. 
	Coverage of a holiday celebrating the independent spirit of the Philippines 
	would have been an excellent opportunity for the newspaper to discuss the 
	ongoing debate over independence from the U.S. during that period. Seeing as 
	Velasco was the principle editor of the paper, it is likely that this tone 
	reflected his overall perception and outlook as a Filipino American. When 
	considering the obstacles he had to face in order to make a living it is 
	curious that he did not write more forcefully about major issues such as 
	discrimination and independence. While Velasco worked on <i>The Colonist </i>
	he attempted to use it to bring together the Filipino community and help 
	them to celebrate their presence in the United States. Nevertheless, when 
	looking at the editorial stance Velasco set for the <i>Colonist,</i> the 
	major characteristic that stands out is one of complacency and contentment.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Even as he worked on the<i> 
	Colonist,</i> Velasco continued to work in various forms of manual labor and 
	domestic service. He picked fruit in Eastern Washington, was a houseboy, 
	worked in the canneries, and of course continued to write. He also continued 
	his education. On his second trip to Alaska in 1926 he stopped in 
	Bellingham, WA and talked with a representative of the Bellingham Normal 
	School, which would later become Western Washington University. The 
	following fall Velasco began attending the school and over his very brief 
	stay pushed forward with his journalism career in the United States. During 
	the fall of 1926 he became the president of the Scribes Club and managing 
	editor of the Club's newsletter, <i>The Red Arro</i>w. The <i>Red Arrow</i> 
	was a student newsletter published with varying regularity and discussing 
	literary comings and goings at the school. There is no evidence that the 
	newsletter cost anything or that it had a large readership. In addition, 
	Velasco edited <i>The Weekly Messenger</i>, an informational newsletter 
	geared for the entire student body. All of this is remarkable considering 
	that Velasco was also a full-time student.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a> 
	The following quarter Velasco transferred to the University of Washington, 
	where he continued to write and edit articles for the <i>Philippine Seattle 
	Colonist</i>. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As a 
	Filipino American journalist, Velasco faced many challenges getting the 
	papers he worked for off the ground. It was very difficult to find 
	businesses willing to purchase advertisements in a paper geared toward a 
	small population that was constantly in transit. Subscribers were also hard 
	to come by for the same reasons. When Velasco was forced to work in Alaska 
	one quarter instead of attend the University of Washington, a friend wrote 
	him that she was concerned that the<i> Philippine Seattle Colonist</i> would 
	likely not survive his absence.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">One of the ways that 
	Velasco and other Filipino journalists overcame these barriers was by 
	forming a sort of writers and journalists support network. According to 
	Brown, “the two Velasco brothers and the other Filipino journalists worked 
	in concert … by exchanging information.”<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> 
	Looking over the Filipino newspapers produced during the era, many of them 
	have the same people working on them. Not only did Filipino journalists 
	exchange job opportunities but they also shared stories for publication and 
	advice. Thus, though the Filipino community faced barriers as a result of 
	their ethnicity they also were able to use ethnic ties as a way to rally 
	themselves and work together as a community. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Velasco continued to 
	work on a number of different Filipino community newspapers after the <i>
	Colonist </i>shut down in 1927. <i>The Chomly Spectator </i>was a small 
	cannery newsletter written and edited by Asian cannery workers. Published 
	roughly every two weeks, the format of the newsletter was a stack of 
	loose-leaf eight and a half by eleven sheets of paper, often featuring a 
	hand-drawn cover. The <i>Chomly Spectator</i> discussed a variety of topics, 
	including relations with white foremen and the expected fish harvest. 
	Velasco also contributed to the <i>Seagull News</i>, another small cannery 
	newsletter with a circulation limited to the workers of the cannery where 
	Velasco was employed and friends and associates of Velasco. According to 
	Brown, during this period Velasco also worked on two other community 
	newspapers about which little is known, <i>The Filipino American</i> and <i>
	The Informer</i>. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><i>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Philippine American 
	Review</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> was 
	the largest newspaper Velasco worked on between the <i>Colonist </i>and the
	<i>Filipino Forum</i>. The <i>Philippine American Review </i>was published 
	by Roma Trias on a monthly basis by the Review Publishing Company from 1928 
	to 1930. Typically seven to eight pages in length, the monthly often began 
	with a letter from the editor about the condition of the Philippines and the 
	newspaper. It would then have five or six stories about any number of topics 
	in the Filipino community. It would often end with some poetry or a comic 
	section. One significant difference between the <i>Colonist </i>and <i>The 
	Philippine American Review </i>was that the <i>Review</i> was printed while 
	the <i>Colonist</i> was most likely mimeographed </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The most significant 
	difference between <i>The Philippine American Review </i>and the<i> 
	Colonist, </i>however, was the <i>Review's</i> willingness to confront 
	controversial political issues such as ethnic tension, labor, equality, and 
	Philippine independence. When characterizing this paper it is easy to say 
	that The <i>Philippine American Review</i> lived up to its promise to 
	provided a “frank, sincere, and honest-to-goodness discussion of the 
	Philippine problem.”<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">
	</span><a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14">
	<span style="vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></a></span> Velasco made a 
	distinct effort to provide an equitable and balanced perspective on the 
	issues. For example, in an article about whether or not the Filipino Senate 
	President should cooperate with the new US governor of the Philippines, 
	Velasco not only acknowledged the relationship between the U.S. and the 
	Philippines but also expressed an opinion on this relationship. The article 
	reads, “Governor General Stimson and Senate President Quezon by working 
	together will accelerate the progress of the country; separately, they will 
	hamper and retard its development.” Here Velasco showed that he felt the 
	best interests of the Philippines as well as of the United States would be 
	served through cooperation. As noted previously, <i>The Colonist </i>did not 
	make any effort to note or express an opinion on political issues facing the 
	Filipino people.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align: baseline">
	</span><a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15">
	<span style="vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></a></span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Considering the 
	progression from <i>The Colonist</i> to <i>The Philippine American Review</i>, 
	Velasco appears to have developed a new, more assertive perspective and a 
	new angle to sell to his readers. It is impossible to tell exactly why, but 
	one contributing factor may have been related to his continued inability 
	find mainstream employment. During this period he continued to go up to 
	Alaska during the summers and work grueling hours for little pay in the fish 
	canneries. Velasco wrote to a friend, “The Rainy and dreary days that we 
	have here most of the time only add to the gloomy depression of our 
	spirits.&nbsp; Day in and day out we tread the self-same old beaten path—from our 
	bunk house to the cannery, and back. The rattle of the cans that we make, 
	the deafening noise of the machines, the unpleasant odor of gas, the clouds 
	of suffocating smoke… all these are ours to endure...”<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a> 
	Velasco was clearly frustrated by the need to work in the canneries and put 
	up with these conditions on the basis of race and not inherent 
	qualification. For this reason, it is not hard to see why Velasco’s tone 
	changed from <i>The Colonist </i>to <i>The Philippine American Review.</i> 
	By the late 1920s, Velasco had grown into an understanding of his freedom to 
	express his opinion. As he became progressively more aware of the fact that 
	America was not a perfect utopia in which everyone was treated equally; his 
	writing became more and more pointed and openly critical of American 
	policy.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">That being said, Velasco 
	did make a conscious effort to provide a full and well-rounded perspective 
	on the issues. In fact, in <i>The Philippine American Review </i>Velasco 
	published articles from other newspapers that supported an anti-independence 
	agenda. In one such article the writer argued that it was in the best 
	interests of the Philippines to be “under strict military rule.”<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> 
	The <i>Philippine American Review</i> did not provide any commentary on 
	these articles but simply by publishing them it demonstrated a desire to 
	discuss all sides of the issue and an interest in providing a full, 
	uncensored account of the issues and challenges facing the Filipino people.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1930 the <i>Philippine American Review </i>became the <i>
	Philippine Review</i> and took on a new staff and a new magazine format with 
	a far more upscale look. Instead of being the editor, as he was for <i>The 
	Philippine American Review</i>, Velasco simply wrote for the <i>Philippine 
	Review</i>. The paper<i> </i>was about ten to fifteen pages in length and 
	was published monthly for ten cents a copy, which was relatively expensive 
	for the times.&nbsp; It was owned by Vicente Naeva.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When looking at the development of Velasco’s Journalism <i>The 
	Philippine Review</i> represents where Velasco began to put what was really 
	on his mind down in writing.&nbsp; The main difference between the two newspapers 
	was that the <i>Philippine Review</i> took a much stronger stance on 
	independence. The <i>Philippine American Review</i> had supported 
	independence, but was willing to make certain concessions to the United 
	States in order to facilitate that goal. In contrast, the <i>Philippine 
	Review</i> unabashedly promoted immediate independence, and offered up only 
	limited interest for further discussion of the issue. Thus, while the <i>
	Philippine American Review</i> represented an immigrant community strongly 
	identifying with its adopted nation, the <i>Philippine Review</i> spoke for 
	a faction of the Filipino American population that felt decidedly separate 
	from the United States. In contrast to the <i>Philippine American Review,</i> 
	the <i>Philippine Review</i> resisted assimilation into American culture and 
	was ambivalent about cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines. Just 
	the difference in titles reveals the shift between the newspapers with 
	regard to the issue. By eliminating the &quot;American&quot; part of the title, the <i>
	Philippine Review</i> made a strong statement in favor of immediate 
	independence. The <i>Philippine Review’</i>s perspective on independence and 
	its discussion of conditions in the canneries, Filipino education, and 
	discrimination demonstrated that it was focused first and foremost on 
	promoting Filipino interests.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-left: 0in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shift 
	between the two papers demonstrates Velasco’s own developing views on 
	independence and cooperation with America. According to a 1931 article in 
	the <i>Philippine Review,</i> “From the venerable Aguinaldo down to the 
	children in the primary school room, we have not been able to find a 
	Filipino, living in his own country who is <b>not</b> in favor of 
	independence”<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a> 
	This statement shows that Velasco saw himself as very connected to his 
	Filipino counterparts and that he felt there was universal sentiment amongst 
	Filipinos in support of independence. In its support for the Philippines, 
	the newspaper showed that these Filipinos had retained their ethnic identity 
	to the point where they were no longer willing to capitulate to any U.S. 
	demands.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a> 
	By the early 1930s, Velasco felt that if the United States did not grant 
	immediate independence it demonstrated the intention of the U.S. never to 
	grant Filipinos independence. As the <i>Philippine Review</i> argued, “the 
	mere setting of a date for future independence of the islands gives the 
	Philippine people no opportunity to express their views. Furthermore it is 
	manifest from the hearings that the fixing of a deferred date from 
	Philippine independence is regarded as a plan to make impossible the 
	ultimate granting of such a proposal.<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>” 
	This stance on the part of the newspaper shows that Velasco felt the 
	Filipino people were being victimized by the United States’ continued 
	backpedaling on Philippine independence. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-left: 0in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>
	Philippine Review</i> also took strong stances on labor disputes and 
	discrimination, further demonstrating Velasco’s determination to confront 
	Filipino problems and not passively watch issues that he felt strongly about 
	slip away. In the early 1930s many Filipinos worked in Alaska during the 
	summers. Yet the process of getting a job in Alaska often meant going to an 
	office filled with other Filipinos and fighting in vain for a fair wage. 
	Most Filipinos received entry-level jobs, while the Chinese often ran or 
	even owned the canneries, and controlled all hiring. Wherever Filipinos 
	competed with whites they received lower wages and longer hours.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a> 
	As the <i>Philippine Review</i> reported, “the line between jobs open and 
	not open to Orientals and Filipinos is tightly drawn. Neither work performed 
	nor wages earned by the latter have so far proved attractive to American 
	itinerant workers.”<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a> 
	By publicizing and protesting the discrimination against Filipino workers, 
	the <i>Philippine Review</i> showed its concern for the Filipino community 
	and its desire to improve their condition.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoListBullet" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-left: 0in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Velasco 
	continued to edit and write for the <i>Philippine Review </i>even after he 
	began publishing the <i>Filipino Forum.</i> Of all the papers that Velasco 
	worked on prior to the <i>Forum</i>, <i>The Philippine Review</i> had 
	probably the greatest significance because it was while writing for the <i>
	Review</i> that Velasco came into his own as a writer and developed the 
	political sentiments that would inform his later work at the <i>Filipino 
	Forum</i>. <i>The Filipino Forum</i> became one the most successful and 
	influential Filipino newspapers in the United States.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking over this short but important period of Velasco’s life, 
	it is clear that he was, first and foremost, a writer. He wrote constantly 
	everywhere he went, newsletters pamphlets, papers, speeches, and poetry. 
	Through his writing he gives us a glimpse of both his own life and the 
	comings and goings of the Filipino community in the Pacific Northwest. 
	Whether or not he was writing to a large subscription base or to family 
	friends, he never ceased writing and he never ceased using his writing to 
	unite and inform the community. Despite the barriers of racial 
	discrimination and financial hardship, Velasco became a major force in 
	Filipino journalism and a crucial leader in the ongoing struggle for 
	economic and social justice for Filipino-Americans. Ironically, it was this 
	same passion for writing that ultimately resulted in his early death. 
	Velasco was in Alaska in the summer of 1968, working, as he had most summers 
	during the previous four decades, in the salmon canneries. When a fire broke 
	out in his bunkhouse, Velasco and the other men scrambled to safety, but 
	then Velasco realized that he had forgotten his precious typewriter. He dove 
	back into the flaming structure, but did not make it back out. He died as he 
	had lived:&nbsp; a journalist to the very end.</span></p>
