	  <p class="arial10">The 
			International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) has a long 
			history of progressive racial policies, as did its predecessor, the 
			International Longshoreman’s Association (ILA). In 1918, the ILA 
			opened its ranks to men of any race. The gesture did not put an end 
			to discrimination, and the union remained mostly white, but at a 
			time when most unions explicitly excluded nonwhites, it was a 
			significant step. When the ILWU broke away from the ILA and joined 
			the CIO in 1937, it took further steps to include workers of color. 
			But the ILWU was not always as 
			color-blind as it was supposed to be.&nbsp; Racism can’t be written away 
			in a contract, but requires cultural work and visionary leadership.&nbsp; One man who mixed union 
			leadership with civil rights activism in the ILWU was Frank Jenkins. 
			A second-generation longshoreman, Jenkins became one of first 
			African Americans to hold a leadership position in that important 
			union. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoHeader">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
			late as the 1940s, blacks were explicitly barred from most unions. 
			On the West Coast, the major ship-building union, the International 
			Brotherhood of Boilermakers, &nbsp;Iron Ship Builders had a constitution 
			that allowed only whites to be union members.<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[1]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			In December, 1943, the Fair Employment Practices Commission ordered 
			the Boilermakers to abolish their white-only clause.<a name="_ednref2" title href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			At the same time, black ship builders filed suit in the federal 
			court of California against the Boilermakers union and other 
			discriminatory companies.&nbsp; The California Supreme Court ruled in 
			favor of the black workers arguing that a union’s “asserted rights 
			to choose its own members does not merely relate to social 
			relations; it affects the fundamental right to work for a living.”<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			This was something the ILA had understood decades before the 
			Boilermakers and other white-only unions were forced to open their 
			unions to everyone.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoHeader">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
			<i>The Dispatcher</i> – the ILWU’s newspaper – ran an obituary of 
			prominent African-American union member Frank Jenkins in April, 
			1973, it honored Jenkins’s four decades of activist leadership.&nbsp; The 
			paper cited Jenkins’s longtime commitment to racial equality in a 
			way that made him not just a civil rights activist, but a true 
			“labor veteran.”<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			Although many details of Jenkins’s life are uncertain, this 
			biography seeks to use what records are available to the public 
			preserve our memory of Frank Jenkins as an important Pacific 
			Northwest civil rights activist as well as union leader.&nbsp; </span>

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Researching Frank Jenkins was a complicated, yet rewarding task.&nbsp; 
			Information is incomplete and sometimes very difficult to locate.&nbsp; 
			The main point of reference for Jenkins’s life came from a tape 
			recorded interview by Richard C. Berner in 1972.&nbsp; Invented 
			vocabulary was part of Jenkins’s charm.&nbsp; In his interview, he used 
			the term “whitelisted” instead of blacklisted when describing what 
			often happened to unwanted workers.<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			When questioned by the interviewer,&nbsp; Jenkins is quick to respond 
			that the two are the same and continues telling his story.&nbsp; 
			Listening to the interview with Jenkins was mesmerizing.&nbsp; He had a 
			very deep and booming voice that grabs your attention and keeps it.&nbsp; 
			His attention to detail in the account of his life is very 
			impressive, especially when recalling the addresses of present and 
			past hiring halls in Seattle.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">While the 
			interview was helpful in getting to know Jenkins’s personality, it 
			left many holes in both his personal life and his career on the 
			waterfront.&nbsp; Additional help came from historian Ronald Magden, 
			author of two books about Puget Sound longshore workers, who knew 
			Jenkins and helped fill in the details about his role in the union.&nbsp; 
			An interview with Frank’s younger brother Andy also contributed to 
			Frank’s lesser known years.&nbsp; In our conversation about Jenkins, 
			Magden and I decided that Jenkins would have been a very difficult 
			man to interview.&nbsp; He was so humble that he was unlikely to want to 
			talk about himself for an extended period of time.<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			But over thirty years after his death, the ideals that Frank Jenkins 
			stood for, and a glimpse at why he stood for them, deserve attention 
			that he may not have brought to them himself. &nbsp;</span></p>
			<h1 style="line-height:normal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins’s Early 
			Years as an Army Brat</span></h1>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Frank Jenkins 
			was born in 1902 in Monterey, California at what is now Fort Ord.&nbsp; 
			His three siblings were born on Army bases all over the United 
			States and Philippines.&nbsp; In 1909, Jenkins, his mother, his older 
			sister Frances, and his younger brothers Edward and Andrew settled 
			at Fort Lawton in Seattle while his father completed his last six 
			months as a commissioned soldier in Honolulu, Hawaii.&nbsp; Although 
			there is little information on Frank’s earlier years, it seems that 
			his military upbringing set a tone for how he would live his life.&nbsp; 
			He was persistent, hardworking, and willing to fight for his 
			country, even though that would later cause him much grief.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Frank’s father 
			joined the United States Army at a young age and served in both the 
			9th and 10th Cavalries during the Spanish American War in Cuba.&nbsp; He 
			was in the unit that took Teddy Roosevelt off San Juan Hill.&nbsp; Frank 
			grew up hearing that “Colonel Roosevelt,” as his father called him, 
			had a soft spot for black people and especially the black soldier.<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			His father would become a role model to Frank as an example of an 
			African-American man leading a successful and rewarding life.&nbsp; 
			Frank’s mother, who was a military child herself and a native of the 
			Philippines, also set an impressive standard for her children.&nbsp; In 
			the years approaching the Civil Rights Movement, Mrs. Jenkins 
			involved herself in every social justice cause in Seattle and was 
			quite a forward thinker for her time.<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			Both Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins would have an influence on Frank’s life.&nbsp; 
			Despite the proximity to and the honor they attached to the 
			military, Frank’s parents had a different type of life in mind for 
			him. </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins’s 
			parents never completed high school and were adamant that he 
			graduate and continue with higher education.&nbsp; His mother had her 
			heart set on the field of law for her eldest son but Jenkins had his 
			own thoughts on the matter.&nbsp; In his early teens though, his parents 
			had the final say in his education and so he and his sister 
			progressed to Queen Anne High School after graduating from Fort 
			Lawton Grammar School.<a name="_ednref9" title href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			In his 1972 interview, Frank noted that while attending Queen Anne 
			High School, although he and his sister were “discriminated against 
			quite sharply,” they acquired “extensive fistic ability” which 
			spread the word that the Jenkins kids were not to be fooled with.<a name="_ednref10" title href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			“Fistic ability” is a term that Jenkins himself invented.&nbsp; </span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins began 
			work on the waterfront beginning roughly in 1918.&nbsp; Jenkins dropped 
			out of Queen Anne High School after his sophomore year even after 
			his parents discouraged him from it.&nbsp; In his interview, he insists 
			that racism had nothing to do with his decision – it was simply 
			because he thought he knew everything he had to learn from school.&nbsp; 
			The decision would be life-altering, to the point where his 
			familiarity with the waterfront—its business, its people, and its 
			politics—became almost second nature.&nbsp; Years later, Jenkins recalled 
			with ease the locations of present and past hiring halls in Seattle, 
			including old pier numbers, which have changed several times over 
			the course of the waterfront’s history.&nbsp;</span></p>
			<h1 style="line-height:normal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins Joins 
			the Waterfront Workforce</span></h1>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins’s 
			decision to drop out of school may have been informed by previous 
			work experience he found through his father’s assistance.&nbsp; After 
			retiring from the Army, Frank’s father became a foreman for an oil 
			importer named Griffiths and Sprague Stevedoring Company, which gave 
			him some authority over the workers on the dock.&nbsp; During the 1910’s, 
			trade from China and Japan made Seattle a major Pacific Coast port.<a name="_ednref11" title href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			While Asian shipping companies exported oils, teas, and silk to the 
			United States, goods such as cotton, lumber, grains, and machinery 
			crossed the Pacific from Seattle to major Asian ports.<a name="_ednref12" title href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The summer 
			before Jenkins dropped out of school, his father gave him a job on 
			the company dock.&nbsp; Jenkins recalled working with Mexicans, 
			African-Americans, and Scandinavians as well as other white ethnics 
			that summer.&nbsp; Following a bitter strike in 1916 during which 
			employers brought in 3-400 African American strikebreakers (out of a 
			total of 1400) mainly from Kansas City, St. Louis, and New Orleans, 
			the International Longshoremen’s Association had grudgingly accepted 
			people of color into its ranks.&nbsp; One scholar noted that </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:45.0pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">efforts to 
			discriminate against Negroes were frequent during the early years of 
			their participation in [Seattle] longshore activities.&nbsp; Many white 
			workers who had never worked with Negro longshoremen previous to 
			this time refused to do so and left their jobs… During the wartime 
			boom, Negroes took an active part in formulate the policies of the 
			union. Mainly through the cooperation of members of the I.W.W., 
			Negroes were elected to many of the important committees.&nbsp; As work 
			on the waterfront slackend many Negroes were unemployed. Their 
			membership in the ILA gradually decreased due to this lack of work 
			and the inability to pay dues.<a name="_ednref13" title href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a> 
			&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins 
			experienced both the positive and negative aspects of this period of 
			intense labor conflict on Seattle’s waterfront.&nbsp; His first exposure 
			to racial discrimination in the labor force was during World War I.&nbsp; 
			Local shipyards in Seattle frequently offered young men positions as 
			riveters and bolter-uppers at very respectable wages.&nbsp; Jenkins 
			claims that racial discrimination made the task of getting such a 
			job difficult but he triumphed in the end, sometimes resorting to 
			“subterfuge” to overcome the barriers against him.<a name="_ednref14" title href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			He treated being turned down as only a minor set back and not a 
			permanent defeat.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In 1921, local 
			African American real estate dealer James H. Roston worked with the 
			Pacific Steamship company to find African Americans employment as 
			strike breaking stewards on the company’s Alaska line.&nbsp; It’s unclear 
			whether Jenkins worked as a steward in this dispute, but he did work 
			in Alaska that summer.<a name="_ednref15" title href="#_edn15"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[15]</span></span></a></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Regardless, the Seattle Jenkins returned to 1921 was a much different 
			place than the one he first began working in in 1918.&nbsp; The power of 
			Seattle’s longshore union had been dramatically reduced by cuts in 
			shipbuilding employment and intense anti-radical campaigns following 
			the General Strike in 1919.&nbsp; Consequently, the union lost its 
			control of waterfront hiring halls, which meant disaster for the 
			union but also “opened the books” to workers regardless of race, 
			religious creed, or political views&nbsp; If the union workers could 
			successfully bring these men into the union, the employers would 
			have a difficult time of finding scabs to work during a strike.&nbsp; 
			Frank’s father urged all of the men working under him to join the 
			ILA, which they did, including young Jenkins.&nbsp; The ILA’s new “open 
			book” policy theoretically gave all men equal opportunity in the 
			union, but in practice, the system remained biased—abused by union 
			members and employers alike.&nbsp; Local hiring halls engaged in 
			favoritism:&nbsp; Some workers got more work than others, and company 
			control of some hiring halls made it difficult to guarantee steady 
			employment, especially for blacks.&nbsp; Frank Jenkins recalled that 
			“some people would sit on the bench [in a hiring hall] from four 
			days to a week or more without a job.&nbsp; Other people who were favored 
			would come in from one job and go right back out to another.”<a name="_ednref16" title href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			In addition, Jenkins noted, several hiring halls were “lily white,” 
			that is, you would never find any blacks working out of them.&nbsp; The 
			only halls that hired blacks were the non-union “Fink Halls”, bit 
			they too often engaged in favoritism.</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both 
			black and white worker frustration over this system peaked February 
			1934, when selected delegates from the different unions on the 
			Pacific Coast demanded a “single, coast wide contract, creation of a 
			union-controlled hiring hall, $1.00 per hour straight time, the six 
			hour day, and the thirty hour week.”<a name="_ednref17" title href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			They decided to strike if their employers did not meet the terms.&nbsp; 
			After negotiations between the ILA and the Waterfront Employers 
			Association (WEA) failed to reach a solution, all of the ILA locals 
			on the Pacific Coast struck against their employers on May 9, 1934.&nbsp; 
			Twelve thousand men did not go to work and only about 100 men 
			crossed the picket lines to their jobs.&nbsp; In Seattle, only three men 
			continued to work.&nbsp; Many other unions in Seattle offered their 
			support by joining the strike including the Seamen, Marine Firemen, 
			Masters, Mates, and Pilots, and the Marine Cooks and Stewards.&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins’s 
			participation in the 1934 strike is not well documented and although 
			it is certain that he was not a major leader among the strikers, his 
			experience on the waterfront made him a high profile worker and many 
			men followed his example.&nbsp; His younger brother Andrew was one of 
			these men.&nbsp; In a 1987 interview, Andy recalled several incidents 
			during the strike in which he was following his brother and suddenly 
			they found themselves in the thick of the fight at the picket 
			lines.&nbsp; Both Frank (age 32 at the time) and Andy (age 27) were in 
			the union and it seems that Frank was often looking out for him.&nbsp; 
			Frank Jenkins’s reputation on the waterfront, and his concern for 
			his younger brother, are evident in the following scenario:</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:45.0pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[There was] a 
			gauntlet at Pier 2 Alaska Steam.&nbsp; Some of the scabs [strike 
			breakers] jumped overboard, but the rest of the scabs had to walk 
			through a longshoremen’s gauntlet up to Western Avenue.&nbsp; I was 
			standing there.&nbsp; Just a kid.&nbsp; A nobody.&nbsp; This guy that I was 
			standing behind […] was a longshoreman.&nbsp; All of a sudden he jumped 
			up and ran among the scabs, grabbed one guy and started beating the 
			hell out of him.&nbsp; He grabbed these knucks [brass knuckles] from the 
			hand of the scab and turned to me.&nbsp; “You’re Frank’s brother aren’t 
			you?&nbsp; Beat it!”<a name="_ednref18" title href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In the violence 
			that erupted that day, Frank’s reputation and popularity kept Andrew 
			out of harm and Andy’s appreciation shows in his interview where he 
			is always quick to describe his brother as a “star” or throw him 
			another complement.<a name="_ednref19" title href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			Being caught by the police with a weapon such as brass knuckles 
			usually led to arrest.&nbsp; Small pockets of violence, such as this one, 
			broke out daily on the waterfront during the 1934 strike.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In June of 1934, 
			the consequences of the strike were beginning to have major 
			implications on the welfare of residents in Alaska, although it was 
			never the intent of the strikers to harm the general public.&nbsp; The 
			closure of Pacific ports meant that Alaska was short on imported 
			food.&nbsp; Seattle’s newly appointed mayor, Charles L. Smith, realized 
			the seriousness of the situation and promised to stop supporting 
			non-Alaska shippers once the Longshoremen released the cargoes to 
			Alaska.&nbsp; The “Alaska Agreement” allowed union longshoremen to work 
			on ships containing goods for Alaska.&nbsp; The Alaska Steamship 
			Operators vowed only to hire ILA members as a show of gratitude.
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
			month later, the Waterfront Employers Association &nbsp;notified the 
			union that it would arbitrate all issues on a coast wide basis. On 
			July 31, 1934, the Pacific longshoremen returned to work.&nbsp; The union 
			eventually won increased wages from eighty-five cents per hour to 
			ninety-five cents per hour and the thirty-hour workweek.&nbsp; Although 
			the hiring halls were still open to non-union men, everyone would 
			have to pay the same fee to utilize the halls and all of the 
			dispatchers would be required to be union members and would be 
			appointed by the ILA.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The victory for 
			the ILA in 1934 came in no small part through racial solidarity 
			between white and black workers, and gave African-American activists 
			important institutional resources from which to promote racial 
			justice as a labor and class issue and not just a civil rights 
			issue.&nbsp; Frank Jenkins recalled that following the strike, the 
			waterfront employers treated everybody “fair and square” regardless 
			of race.&nbsp; He also noted that the union had become much more 
			democratic: finally, everyone had an equal voice and could vote.<a name="_ednref20" title href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This experience 
			helped Frank see labor unions as important civil rights advocates, 
			with ILWU founder and president Harry Bridges standing out to him as 
			a “civil rights man” with an impressive record worth mentioning in 
			the same breath as Martin Luther King Jr.<a name="_ednref21" title href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			With the shift of waterfront workers from the ILA to the ILWU, the 
			election of Bridges as President, and the improved wages and hours 
			in the union, Frank said waterfront work “went from darkness to 
			sunshine.”<a name="_ednref22" title href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins seized 
			the opportunities provided by the new racial attitudes within the 
			union by becoming involved with the ILWU Local 19 Executive Board.&nbsp; 
			He held positions of “official capacity” in the union from 1936 to 
			1940 and from 1943 until his retirement in 1967.<a name="_ednref24" title href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
			<i>The Dispatcher</i> recorded that he was on the Labor Relations 
			committee in 1947.<a name="_ednref25" title href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a>&nbsp;

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Frank’s work on 
			the Labor Relations Committee included gathering port working rules 
			from the various local unions and coordinating them with the Coast 
			Labor Relations Committee in San Francisco.&nbsp; This committee was 
			extremely important to the union because each port along the Pacific 
			Coast had different operating rules, based on what type of cargo 
			they dealt with.&nbsp; While ports such as Seattle and San Francisco 
			dealt mainly with large container ships, smaller ports like 
			Anacortes and Port Angeles handled lumber and other natural 
			products.&nbsp; Keeping all of the ports in good review with the Coast 
			Labor Relations Committee was a very important.&nbsp; Frank supposedly 
			had an encyclopedic knowledge of the agreements between the union 
			and other associations such as the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) 
			and the Labor Relations Committee (LRC).<a name="_ednref26" title href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			When the Jenkins estate donated Frank’s papers to the University of 
			Washington Libraries, various labor law handbooks and the ILWU 
			constitution were all well worn and some had coffee stains on them, 
			suggesting that Jenkins not only read them but perhaps even 
			regularly carried them around.<a name="_ednref27" title href="#_edn27"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[27]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">As a Local 19 
			leader, Frank worked alongside Martin Jugum, a longtime Executive 
			Board member, on all negotiations that concerned the ILWU.&nbsp; This 
			included making sure that the men of Local 19 had the best health 
			benefits available to them, and that they were working in the most 
			efficient methods possible.&nbsp; It also required deciding how to 
			reshape the workforce once machinery was introduced and required 
			changing safety regulations to fit the newer technology.&nbsp; Jugum and 
			Jenkins attended caucuses together in San Francisco and helped to 
			prevent disturbances on the waterfront that could possibly lead to a 
			strike or detriment the workers in anyway.&nbsp; Frank Jenkins and Martin 
			Jugum worked as a team.&nbsp; Jenkins knew the facts and issues, Jugum 
			did the negotiating.&nbsp; According to Ron Magden, </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:45.0pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[Frank’s] 
			greatness on [the Labor Relations Committee] was the continuity he 
			had.&nbsp; He’d been on that committee since he began on the waterfront 
			and so he knew the contract backwards and forwards.&nbsp; Jugum was a 
			better speaker, but Jenkins had the knowledge.&nbsp; Jugum was sort of a 
			smooth it over type of guy, Frank was more of a straight forward 
			‘here’s what we want, now you tell us how far you can go to meeting 
			that.’&nbsp; That would be the Frank Jenkins approach.<a name="_ednref28" title href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The two worked 
			together very successfully for many years.&nbsp; One of the duo’s most 
			remarkable victories was instituting a rotation system.&nbsp; The system 
			allowed for all men to avoid playing into a self-defeating 
			favoritism and instead each receive an equal amount of work.&nbsp; 
			Jenkins was especially adamant that this system replace the old 
			system of steady men.&nbsp; With the old system, racism often played a 
			part in whether a worker could get a job or not.&nbsp; It was especially 
			hard for minorities to find work when companies kept hiring the 
			“steady men.”&nbsp; Jenkins believed that if the old system was kept, 
			blacks would always be left out and would certainly suffer the 
			most.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Jenkins worked to promote anti-racist practices in his union, but 
			found his experience and leadership were not always acknowledged by 
			the broader society. When World War II began, the Army used 
			longshoremen along the entire Pacific Coast to load their vessels.&nbsp; 
			At this time, Frank had a 1-A classification, which granted him 
			access to most of the waterfront, including high-security areas.&nbsp; He 
			was asked by a second lieutenant in the Army if he would be a hatch 
			tender or a winch driver on one of the ships but Jenkins wanted to 
			do more for his country – he wanted to be in the Army and experience 
			the things that he grew up hearing his father talk about.&nbsp; Frank 
			remembered that at the recruiting office, an Army official told him 
			that</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:45.0pt">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">[the Army] 
			wanted people who had experience in loading vessels and handling 
			ship’s gear and so forth.&nbsp; The sergeant at the desk had to go back 
			into the inner office to talk to a lieutenant and when he came 
			[back] he said he wanted people experienced as winch drivers, 
			riggers, hatch tenders and so forth.&nbsp; I said, ‘That’s me.”&nbsp; You go 
			back and see the lieutenant.&nbsp; He [the sergeant] came by and said we 
			want them with quite a bit of experience.&nbsp; I told him that I had 
			over twenty years.&nbsp; He went back to the lieutenant again, but the 
			lieutenant would not come out of the office.&nbsp; When he came back, I 
			told him, ‘hold it.&nbsp; Let’s quit fencing.’&nbsp; He said, ‘Ok, you know 
			what the problem is?’&nbsp; I said, ‘Yes, my color is against me.’&nbsp; He 
			said, That’s right.’&nbsp; I said, ‘Why doesn’t that guy come out and 
			tell me?’&nbsp; He said because he has got me to come out and tell you 
			and it’s embarrassing the hell out of me.&nbsp; I said, ‘Forget about 
			it.&nbsp; Don’t feel embarrassed.’&nbsp; The sergeant said to watch the papers 
			and maybe a position would open up later.<a name="_ednref29" title href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Frank told the 
			sergeant as he walked out the door to watch the papers himself.&nbsp;
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Jenkins did not give up, however.&nbsp; If the Army would not let him in, 
			maybe the Navy would.&nbsp; Thus, he attended a Navy recruiting drive 
			where he personally knew one of the warrant officers doing special 
			recruiting from within the union.&nbsp; As Frank approached him, the 
			warrant officer threw up his hands and said, “There’s no place for 
			you.&nbsp; Don’t ask me any questions.&nbsp; Those are my orders.&nbsp; No place 
			for you here because you haven’t got the right ethnic background.”<a name="_ednref30" title href="#_edn30"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[30]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			Frank’s patriotism hit rock bottom at this point.&nbsp; The Army and Navy 
			had turned him down.&nbsp; He had grown up on Army bases all over the 
			country, his father and grandfather had been soldiers, and he had 
			more experience than most of the other men being recruited.&nbsp; 
			Rejection from the armed forces would long remain a part of how 
			Frank understood the country he lived in.&nbsp; Thirty years after being 
			rejected, Frank offered bitter descriptions of his several attempts 
			to join the military.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">In 1955, a 
			similar event would again raise Frank’s ire.&nbsp; This time however, he 
			would appeal to the courts and win.&nbsp; On July 15, 1955, Jenkins’s 
			Coast Guard pass was taken from him immediately after he testified 
			at the Harry Bridges trial.<a name="_ednref31" title href="#_edn31"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[31]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			The Red Scare was in full force and many union men were accused of 
			being communist.&nbsp; Without evidence, authorities could revoke any 
			type of security or clearance pass from a union man accused of 
			communism.&nbsp; Coast Guard representatives claimed they had been 
			looking for Jenkins since 1953, which Jenkins found hard to believe: 
			he had been living in Seattle and working &nbsp;steady rotations on the 
			waterfront during those two years.<a name="_ednref32" title href="#_edn32"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[32]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			While the Coast Guard attempted to make Jenkins seem harmful to his 
			country, Jenkins fought back with an official appeal to the Coast 
			Guard.&nbsp; On September 13, 1955, an ILWU attorney along with 
			nine white union officers testified as character witnesses at the 
			appeal hearing.<a name="_ednref33" title href="#_edn33"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[33]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			When asked if communists should be permitted access to “strategic” 
			areas, Jenkins responded that “because he was black he would not 
			practice discrimination against any other person.”<a name="_ednref34" title href="#_edn34"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[34]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			Jenkins’s pass was returned to him in November, 1955.<a name="_ednref35" title href="#_edn35"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[35]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			When recalling this incident in his interview, Jenkins claims that 
			he was not surprised at all of the controversy surrounding his pass 
			because of the panic that swept through the country over communism.&nbsp; 
			It is also understandable that he was labeled as such because of his 
			open attitude towards communism and its ideologies.&nbsp; According to Magden however, although Jenkins was in favor of Communist party 
			concepts, he never joined the party.<a name="_ednref36" title href="#_edn36"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[36]</span></span></a></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
			this struggle Jenkins felt a connection with ILWU president Harry 
			Bridges, who also fought false accusations that he had been a 
			communist—accusations that were meant to weaken the union.&nbsp; Although 
			Jenkins admits in the interview that there were some extreme 
			communists in the ILWU, he adamantly defended their right to be 
			whatever they wanted to be and that they coexisted peacefully with 
			Democrats, Republicans, and other political parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Jenkins’s life 
			after his retirement in 1967 is not well documented.&nbsp; He died in 
			April 1973.&nbsp; From his late teens to all but the last six of his 
			life, he was a Longshoreman, and quite proud of it.&nbsp; He called the 
			longshoremen a “different breed of animal,” which he meant in the 
			most complementary way.<a name="_ednref37" title href="#_edn37"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[37]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			As a group of men who “will not accept what they think is not fair,” 
			the Longshoremen live on the premise that the union is controlled 
			from the bottom to the top.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="vertical-align:baseline">
			<a name="_ednref38" title href="#_edn38">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">
			[38]</span></a></span></span>&nbsp; No contract passed without the 
			support of the workers, which is why Jenkins’ position on the 
			executive board meant more than making decisions with fellow board 
			members.&nbsp; Frank had to keep a delicate balance between the workers 
			and the employers.&nbsp; The fact that he was elected nearly every year 
			during his time in the union shows that he was successful.&nbsp; </span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">
			<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Despite his 
			setback during the war, Jenkins lead a remarkable life, one that 
			would make his parents proud, even if he did not become a lawyer.&nbsp; 
			He put his heart and soul into a union that dramatically changed 
			social norms by placing men of all different ethnicities and races 
			side by side in the workforce.&nbsp; Magden recalled that “I never heard 
			of one disparaging remark of Frank Jenkins.&nbsp; Every person I ever 
			talked to thought the world of him.”<a name="_ednref39" title href="#_edn39"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[39]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
			In reality, there were probably people who thought otherwise of 
			Frank but while interviewing over one-hundred Seattle Longshoremen, 
			Ron Magden heard “nothing but praise.”<a name="_ednref40" title href="#_edn40"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[40]</span></span></a>&nbsp;
