style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-language: JA">owledge of the United Farm Workers of America was from Rainbow Coalition organizing in the early &lsquo;90s, as an organizer for the Rainbow Coalition of Washington State, turning out the vote for Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s presidential campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Before that&mdash;I was 38, 39 years old when that happened, not a young woman&mdash;I had never registered to vote, had never been involved at all in any kind of activism.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A Rainbow Coalition organizer knocked on my door, her name is Ann Atkeson.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>She organized me into being a precinct captain for Jesse Jackson and I became increasingly more involved in the campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was an exciting campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I became a founding member of the Whatcom County Rainbow Coalition, and then a founding member of the Statewide Rainbow Coalition.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I got involved with a wonderful group of people that are still very involved in many ways, like Larry Gossett and Sally Soriano, Mike Lowry, Damani Johnson, Maury Foisy, Cindy Domingo. <O:P></O:P>It was the Rainbow Coalition organizers that, as I became more involved, began to teach me about the United Farm Workers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I had never heard of Cesar Chavez.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;d never heard of unions.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They taught me about that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Some farm workers came in 1990 and asked to meet with the Rainbow Coalition members here in <ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on"><ST1:CITY w:st="on">Bellingham</ST1:CITY> </ST1:PLACE>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They asked for our support of their boycott against Chateau Ste. Michelle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They layed out the fact that they wanted a union contract and all the abuses that were going on.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We of course supported it and decided to take a stronger role in that support.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I volunteered to head up a committee to begin organizing a corporate campaign against the company in support of the farm workers in eastern <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I did that from 1991, &rsquo;92 and the Rainbow took up the call quite well because we had a structure that we had developed for the Jesse Jackson campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had 10 pretty well formed chapters across the state, and all the chapters took up the boycott and began organizing the boycott in their areas , which created an incredible momentum.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had 10 statewide boycott committees, each one coming off of an organized Rainbow Coalition.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Each one of those boycott campaigns had its own structure of a campaign coordinator and members of that committee that held meetings deciding strategy in a collective manner. <O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> In eastern <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Washington</ST1:STATE> at that time was a young man from Yale&mdash;his name is Kurt Peterson&mdash;who was a fellow from some department in Yale who had volunteered to come out to advocate for farm workers in eastern <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>To his credit, he had begun researching and found where the UFW had begun organizing in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s, and there was an independent group called the United Farm Workers of Washington State that still existed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt Peterson came from Yale,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>to Granger, <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>and began to introduce himself.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He was doing his own research about who was involved and what the issues were. <O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> The workers came to us at the Rainbow Coalition, we met Kurt, we met with them, and together with Kurt Peterson we developed a Corporate Campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We just hit the entire state for a good two and a half years.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a good campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The profile of the campaign went way up.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were giving the company a really hard time.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Kurt was an amazing researcher.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Chateau Ste. Michelle was owned by US Tobacco, and he was researching the vulnerabilities of the company itself.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We zeroed in on the CEO, Alan Shoup,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>where he worked, where he went to church, what his beliefs were, we knew everything.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We picketed all of their concerts at Woodinville.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They had this &ldquo;Galloping Gourmet&rdquo; sort of person that was on TV on a cooking show and he promoted the wines.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He was a prime target for us.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We tried to get him to talk about the labor struggle, but he refused and was totally anti-union.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We dogged him.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We dogged everybody that had anything to do with the wines that was not supporting the unionization effort.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We leafleted everywhere the wine was.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was your regular corporate campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> We went to their shareholders meetings on the east coast.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We raised money to send a worker&rsquo;s committee with signs and banners.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt and some others bought shares so they could get in, and each one would take a worker.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Every year for about 4 years we created a scene at that shareholders meeting.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They were getting frantic.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We got the ferry system to take the wines off the ferries.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We got support from the flight attendants union from several airlines.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They couldn&rsquo;t boycott the wines, but they never served it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s at the stewardess&rsquo;s discretion what wine was served.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They wouldn&rsquo;t even take it on the plane. That had a huge impact.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We did some international work with the Chateau Ste. Michelle campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We found out that the wine was big in the British market and also had a market somewhere else in <ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Europe</ST1:PLACE> , so we called the UI, the international workers union and they boycotted.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The longshoreman refused to unload it at the docks in <ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Europe</ST1:PLACE> .<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That was huge.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We got it publicized in international newspapers where unions are much more powerful.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We tried to cover everything we could.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It became a very intense corporate campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The <ST1:PLACENAME 
w:st="on">Evergreen</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACENAME w:st="on">State College</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACENAME w:st="on">Labor</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACETYPE w:st="on">Center</ST1:PLACETYPE> helped to develop a very strong support committee in <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Olympia</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>. Helen Lee, Sheila, Paul Ortiz, so many people helping out. <O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Picket lines were going on all the time across the state,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>at restaurants, at the winery itself, at events where the wine was going to be featured.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The winery had a dinner train, that was a very popular tourist attraction, that went from the winery to, I don&rsquo;t remember where, and you would have a fancy dinner and music and serve the wine.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We picketed the train.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The last year of the campaign, we really escalated the corporate campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We decided we were going to block the train.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We let it be known we were going to be doing that.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Helen Chavez and the UFW women did that with the grape boycott, we were going to block this train.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>They found out we were going to do that and they cancelled all of the trains.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Just like that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>No more trains.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was costing them money.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had a friend who was sending us the minutes of the wine commission meetings, and they were becoming very agitated.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>[The refusal to negotiate] was giving [Chateau Ste. Michelle] a bad name.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> It was all grassroots.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The workers were going back and forth to <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Seattle</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>to different events.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had to get them to agree to go and speak for themselves.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was difficult because some of them would have to miss work, and spend a lot of weekends traveling.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was really difficult for them.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We raised money so they could eat right and get the gas.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a very intense campaign all the way around.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> The problem was that the union itself that existed in Granger had no infrastructure.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The membership was totally disconnected from the core board itself, the Chateau Ste. Michelle workers were disconnected from the core board also.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt tried to pull it together and he couldn&rsquo;t so he got very frustrated.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The corporate campaign was taking off very well, but what was needed was more grass roots development of the union membership, and most of all, the Chateau Ste. Michelle workers, it was over 200 workers, to really begin to pull together the campaign at the workplace.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He became very frustrated and came at odds with the board, and in fact the independent union board threatened to fire Kurt and so he quit.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The workers called me and said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have him quit.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;ve never had this much activity.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;ve never gotten to this level with our campaign. We need him.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt called me and told me he was quitting, he was leaving, and so we had a long discussion.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> At that time I was working at Skagit State Bank, here in <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Burlington</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was a bank officer, actually, in charge of data processing operations.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>All of this work I was doing with the Rainbow and the boycott was all on my extra time&mdash;weekends and evenings.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was working 24/7 basically, because I loved what I was doing, but there was also my job&mdash;I&rsquo;d been there for 16 years.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There came a time when all of this had happened with Kurt, and I had met with all of the workers, which is an incredible group of people, and they were very honorable men and women, very serious about what they wanted and they were very unhappy with how the campaign had been run up to the moment that Kurt stepped in.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They asked me to come and help them in Sunnyside.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt said that the only way he would stay is if I went to Sunnyside and took on the role of grassroots organizer with the workers, and then he would continue leading the corporate campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So we agreed to that.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> I quit my job at Skagit State Bank.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>All of this happened between February 1993 and April of 1993.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We [Rainbow Coalition] were so engaged as an organization into the boycott that we&rsquo;re going, &ldquo;what do we do?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;I have to go to Sunnyside.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Rainbow leadership didn&rsquo;t want me to go, but they said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the farm worker, you have to go.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had an informal agreement with the leadership that I would go for a couple of years; try to win the union contract, and then return.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I went to Sunnyside in August . In March I decided to quit my job.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I gave notice that I would work until the end of May.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They were flabbergasted&mdash;I&rsquo;d been there for 16 years&mdash;four more years and I would have reached my retirement.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My parents were going nuts, my family was threatening to take me to a psychiatrist.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But I didn&rsquo;t see any other choice because we had reached a peak with the campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> The farm workers working at the company were such excellent people&mdash;very serious.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was a connection to me with that because I grew up as a farm worker in <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACENAME 
w:st="on">Skagit</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACETYPE w:st="on">County</ST1:PLACETYPE> </ST1:PLACE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I started working in the fields in <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACENAME w:st="on">Skagit</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACETYPE w:st="on">County</ST1:PLACETYPE> </ST1:PLACE>picking strawberries when I was 10.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My father had been a farm worker since he was 10 years old, working all over the country, the migrant circuit.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everybody I knew in my life in my family were farm workers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had all struggled to move out of that and do well.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>All of my sisters and brothers had all done very well for themselves.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My sister Angelica is the chair of the English department at Skagit Valley College, one of my brothers is a stock broker, another one of my brothers owns a cleaning supply store and is a very successful artist, another one owns his own graphics shop and is also a good artist, I have a sister who is a phlebotomist at a medical clinic and runs that whole department, I have a sister who is a police woman.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;ve done well for ourselves.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was working at the bank and my mom was very pleased. My sons and everyone were like, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don&rsquo;t think you folks realize that nothing has changed for farm workers, I told them.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were working in the &lsquo;60s in the fields and here are these men and women now, who are coming to me with the same problems and the same issues.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Nothing&rsquo;s changed and somebody&rsquo;s got to do something. My family was saying, &ldquo;Why you?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Let someone else do it.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>It was quite a lot of turmoil, but I had my mind made up.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I had just recently remarried in April and he was shocked, Joseph was one of the Rainbow organizers.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Ballot heat and street heat, that is what Joseph had taught me and we had really done well with the Rainbow Coalition and he thought we were doing our piece for justice here.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I said, &ldquo;If these workers are going to get a union contract, I think I can help.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think I can go to eastern <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>and really build something there and get this union contract.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I made up my mind and quit my job.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I left the bank at the end of May.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I moved my husband and my 12-year-old sun to Sunnyside and I was in Sunnyside by August 18, 1993.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Kurt, bless his heart, we were like a team.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were so fired up to get this union contract.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We moved in<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>with him and his wife - he was newly married - for about a year.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This was a mission.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were going to get this contract.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The minute I hit the ground in Sunnyside we started a grassroots campaign with the union membership and the Chateau Ste. Michelle workers.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We went by the book.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;d never worked with the UFW.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;d read some books, Peter Matthiason&rsquo;s<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sal Si Se Puedes</I>, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Conquering Goliath </I>and Jacques Levy&rsquo;s biography of Cesar Chavez.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In those three books there are sections where Cesar talks about how to organize and how he organized.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt and I went through that and cut the pieces and ran the campaign by the book, literally.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That&rsquo;s how we did it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> When we met with the Chateau Ste. Michelle workers, there were only four who originally started the committee and they said, &ldquo;OK, Rosalinda, how are we going to do this?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got these books here.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Cesar&rsquo;s going to tell us and we&rsquo;re going to do it one step at a time.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The union constitution, the UFW constitution from <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>, has a lot in there that helped us develop the structure of how you organize committees and how committees take leadership and how that leadership moves a campaign forward.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The decision making process was very transparent, very democratic, from the grassroots. The workers decided how to run the campaign, who the spokesperson was going to be and the whole bit.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a great experience for myself, for the workers and everybody involved.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> It took from fall 1993 and the union contract was signed December 5<SUP>th</SUP>, 1995.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a very short period of time, and it only cost approximately $130,000.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It didn&rsquo;t cost very much money because the workers did the work and we had a lot of support from the farm worker community that was so excited about the possibility of getting this union contract and then once getting this contract at Chateau Ste. Michelle having it move out to other industries, the apple, asparagus, the hopps.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had a lot of support from the local farm worker community which is needed in every camapign. With the corporate campaign hitting really hard with the Rainbow, it really helped to coalesce the pressure on the company so they would sit down and negotiate.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had a thriving, vibrant office in Sunnyside, we had a membership.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>People paid $60 a year to become members of the United Farm Workers of Washington State.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> At that time, the United Farm Workers of Washington State was a separate organization from the national UFW.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was separate because Cesar told the farm worker leaders of the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s, to go on without him, because he didn&rsquo;t have the resources or time to pay attention to anything outside of <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving it up to you to do what you can.&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That&rsquo;s exactly what happened.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They formed their own organization. Cesar allowed them to do it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Their other campaigns never reached a union contract, until Chateau Ste. Michelle.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> It was quite a controversial campaign at the grassroots.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>First of all, I wasn&rsquo;t from the area.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was from the coast, I&rsquo;m a woman, and I hadn&rsquo;t been involved.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I wasn&rsquo;t part of the old guard.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I had a very close tie with the workers, and it&rsquo;s amazing how so few people believed the transparency of the process we developed for strategic operations.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everything that we did, the workers were involved.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don&rsquo;t think to this day that people believe that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That&rsquo;s the disheartening part of the whole thing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Farm workers can do that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Cesar did it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We did it at Chateau Ste. Michelle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A farm worker that can&rsquo;t read and write, can lead a campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The fact that I can [read and write] doesn&rsquo;t disqualify me from it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I came under attack many times for not being enough of a farm worker&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have an accent, I can read and write, I&rsquo;m not&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to say it&mdash;mousey and quiet.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We took leadership and moved the campaign forward the way the workers felt it needed to move forward.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It had never happened before.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a difficult time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Our cars were vandalized.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We spent two weeks without vehicles because someone had vandalized all of our vehicles.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Sugar in the engines, my gas tank, somebody had poked holes in it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A lot of things happened in our campaign and we just continued pushing forward.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We couldn&rsquo;t have done it without the help of the organized structure of the corporate campaign that the Rainbow Coalition was carrying on.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Joseph and I wwere in Sunnyside and Kurt was in Sunnyside, and they were in <ST1:CITY 
w:st="on">Seattle</ST1:CITY> and <ST1:CITY w:st="on">Tacoma</ST1:CITY> and <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Spokane</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>all of these places the campaign was active.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> While the corporate campaign was going on, the conditions at the winery were incredibly intense.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They brought in three union busters.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The first two we wiped out.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>One of the union busters they brought in lasted like 3 months.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The workers made his life miserable and so he quit and went back to <ST1:STATE 
w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>When I was in <ST1:STATE 
w:st="on">California</ST1:STATE> as the legislative director for the union working on water issues, he now works for the metropolitan water district based out of LA, the largest water district in <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>and he&rsquo;s their Latino outreach guy, Adan Ortega, and he was so apologetic, &ldquo;That was just a job.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was a Human Resource person.&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I said, &ldquo;You were a bad boy.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Your name is really bad in certain circles because you were a union buster.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had long discussions on it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;Well, I hope so, &lsquo;cause man, we&rsquo;ve got your name.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They brought in union busters and their job is to divide and conquer and get workers fighting with each other&mdash;we&rsquo;re talking closed meetings, individual meetings and harassment.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A lot of people got fired, we got them reinstated.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>At the same time we were upping the pressure on the company they were upping the pressure at the workplace.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We needed to be able to put pressure on the company in eastern <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We put picket lines there.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We took access.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There is no labor relations law in <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACENAME w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACETYPE w:st="on">State</ST1:PLACETYPE> </ST1:PLACE>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We went in the fields and we acted like we had every right to be there.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>We went in with our clipboards and met with our committees and talked to the workers. The supervisors and managers were furious, saying we were tresapssing.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The vineyards are sloping and you could see the trucks coming down, all of these trucks heading our way.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Their security guards escorted us out and we were walking out yelling &ldquo;Si Se Puedes!&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;m a woman, and very short, so when they would start getting nasty and hard, they&rsquo;d have to talk to me, I&rsquo;m the leader here.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everyone would say I was in charge.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>All of these men coming at me in front of the workers and it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;What are you going to do to me?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Beat me up?&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They would always back off.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>&ldquo;You just need to get out of here.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And I would say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was an amazing time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We did all sorts of things like that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What that does is put the company on notice that the workers have power and they gotta be careful of what they&rsquo;re doing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had meetings right outside the gate with 60-70 workers at a time&mdash;men and women.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We did house meetings.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I visited the workers at least once a week.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was doing the rounds, &ldquo;How are you doing?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; and then keeping notes.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We kept track of everything that was going on inside the company.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> It was a very stable workforce.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The majority of them had been there at least 10 years already.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They had gone through a lot.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The reason that the campaign was so strong was because with all of the exploitation at that company, the workers had maintained unity.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In spite of everything that had been going on&mdash;the sexual harassment at that company was really bad.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That&rsquo;s what pushed the campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There were some supervisors there that took blatant advantage of women.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They had a barn, a shop, that the supervisors, in the morning, the women would come into work, and [the supervisors] would say, &ldquo;I want you [pointing] over there at 3 o&rsquo;clock. I want you [pointing] at 4&rsquo;oclock,&rdquo; and they would force them to have sex with them. Things went on like that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt, at some point, found a little article in the newspaper out there&mdash;sometime in the &rsquo;80s, one of the workers had shot one of the supervisors when he was attempting to rape his wife.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He shot him at work.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He fled&mdash;him and his wife--they were never seen again.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That&rsquo;s besides the bad wages and other things.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That&rsquo;s the thing that they told me about that most stuck in my mind. The tenacity of these people.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That they had stuck it out this long and were still willing to continue with this fight.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I told them, &ldquo;As long as you are, so will I.&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And we did that, me, Joseph and Kurt, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take this to the end.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a very good campaign.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> The other thing that came out of that campaign was the growth of the workers in terms of accepting women leadership.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Because I was a woman and I brought in a lot of the women in the company and organized them to be able to take leadership within the campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They were spokespeople and committee leaders and all of that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They took very strong leadership.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was a group of women that were just fantastic.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They were just great.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>On election day - it was so beautiful - on election day they plastered themselves with stickers, buttons&mdash;they were like walking billboards for the campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was beautiful!<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We carried on a secret ballot election; we couldn&rsquo;t be near the workers, we could only be near the workers when the ballots were being counted, and so they let the workers out early, to their credit, to sit and watch the ballots be counted.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;re sitting there waiting for the workers to come in and it was the most beautiful sight when the women all came in! And they&rsquo;re all like, &ldquo;Yeah!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We won! We know we won!&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They had all of these bumpers stickers, stuck all over their clothes.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They all came and sat by me and we all sat there together and watched the ballot counting.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Of course we won.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was just fantastic.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was just great.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was the most wonderful feeling in the world.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> It&rsquo;s a good contract.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What we did, is we negotiated an election agreement that included the contract itself.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We said, &ldquo;If we win the election then we will negotiate a contract and if after 75 days we haven&rsquo;t come to agreement on a contract, then an arbitrator will come in and impose a contract on both sides.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So we wrote binding arbitration into the election agreement. So we had our contract even before we negotiated.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We were so sure we were going to win that election.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They were so sure we were going to lose that they signed off on it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They kept their word.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We started negotiating June 1<SUP>st</SUP>, or some time in June 1995, and we had a contract by December.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The union, the UFW in its history, has had contracts that had been negotiated for 20 years. That&rsquo;s why, one of my main jobs in <ST1:STATE w:st="on">California</ST1:STATE> and main accomplishments was that I was instrumental in passing and amending the Agriculture Labor Relations act in <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>to include binding arbitration, or binding mediation, which is basically the same thing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now, the UFW in <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>has that same kind of binding mediation, so contract negotiations don&rsquo;t go on forever.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That bill was passed in 2002.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s the first amendment to the Agriculture Labor Relations Act that was passed in 1975.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s the first amendment to it, and I&rsquo;m very proud of that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It took a lot of work. It took a 160 mile march in the heat of summer.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It took incredible political power for us to do it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was heading up the team and coordinating the project and we did it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It works.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That binding arbitration and binding mediation are needed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I saw how it worked at Chateau Ste. Michelle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What it does is bring peace to the workplace.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The contract is signed, the war&rsquo;s over.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now you&rsquo;ve got to work together.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The contract at Chateau Ste. Michelle is a good contract.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s continued to be a good contract.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The company actually likes the contract.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Their HR department is doing so much better because the committee takes care of human resource problems, basically.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Arbitration, grievances, nobody wants the problem, so the committee has to take leadership in dealing with the members when issues come up.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They have medical, a pension plan, a pesticide committee, some of the best wages, I think, that farm workers are earning anywhere.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s a very good contract.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Division within the farm worker community - farm worker leadership that had been there since the &lsquo;60s, they felt that I was an outsider, that I was there to cause problems.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Tom&aacute;s [Villanueva] was a great supporter of the work I was doing, but there were others there that were very much against the organizing that we were doing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We don&rsquo;t know who put sugar in our engines, but somebody did that.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And we don&rsquo;t think it was the company.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Roberto Maestas, the company hired him as a union buster and brought him in on a private jet to talk to the workers, to vote against the union contract.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He spent a couple of days out there to try and convince the workers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That was amazing to me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I couldn&rsquo;t believe that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He&rsquo;s the head of El Centro de la Raza in <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Seattle</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He was a union buster for Chateau Ste. Michelle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;m sure he was paid.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t prove that, but he spent a couple of days in the vineyards, talking to workers, talking to them against voting for the union.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>His argument was that &ldquo;This union doesn&rsquo;t really represent your interests.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Rosalinda&rsquo;s only here to serve her own interest, not yours.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This isn&rsquo;t good for you.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>You ought to sit down and talk to the company without the union.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They&rsquo;ll help you, I&rsquo;ll help you, I&rsquo;ll work with you.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He came in like a month before the election, so the workers already knew how to deal with the union busters, so they were very like, &ldquo;What can you tell us?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Oh Gosh!<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We didn&rsquo;t know!<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What more can you tell us?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Do you have a card so we can call you?&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>Right afterwards it was, &ldquo;Who is this guy?!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We gotta go after him!<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He says he&rsquo;s a Mexican!&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They called him &ldquo;the worm.&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think they still do.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They were so angry with him.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They saw the jet come in and land, they have a landing field out there at Columbia Crest Winery, it&rsquo;s a big tourist attraction, they saw it come in, they saw the cars from the company go out, they saw people come out of the jet, get into the cars and head out to the vineyards to them. Roberto Maestas came in on a private jet to union bust at Chateau Ste. Michelle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;ll tell it to the world.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It happened, it&rsquo;s the truth.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He confronted me on it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I said, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not for unions.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I know you&rsquo;re not for this union, and I know you&rsquo;re not for me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don&rsquo;t really want to talk to you.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Keep doing whatever you&rsquo;re doing and we&rsquo;re going to win our campaign.&rdquo;<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> The other thing that happened is that Margarita Prentice, helped to finance the company union, because the company formed a little core group, about 10 workers, that said they were, the independent union, the real union of the workers, they tried to get the workers to vote for their independent union.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Margarita Prentice helped to finance that. She bought their buttons and somewhere in the archives we have the proof of that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And that was disgraceful for her. The only <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Latina</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>elected representative financed a company union.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was shocking.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>COPE always endorsed her, the labor council always endorsed her, I brought in the Chateau Ste. Michelle committee at the next COPE convention and we opposed her endorsement.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>She was furious.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A lot of labor was furious that we did that too.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>&ldquo;So she opposed your campaign&mdash;she&rsquo;s done a lot for this other union!&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We said, &ldquo;Hey, you know what?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>She opposed our campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;re farm workers.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>She&rsquo;s a Mexican, so are we, and we&rsquo;re urging not to endorse Margarita Prentice.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>We did a campaign and she didn&rsquo;t get the endorsement that year.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>People forget about this stuff.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> I left Sunnyside because in order for us to negotiate the contract with Chateau Ste. Michelle, we had to affiliate our independent union with the United Farm Workers of America in <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We did that just shortly before we started negotiations in 1994.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had to be part of the AFL-CIO.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></font></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><SPAN 
style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-language: JA"><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> </SPAN></font></P>
      <P 
style="tab-stops: .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in"><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><SPAN 
style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-language: JA">The other big piece here that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned is that the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which is FLOC, Valdemer Valasquez, tried to raid our campaign also.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He came in and tried to negotiate with the company for the contract under the auspices of FLOC.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>[This was] early 1994, before we had affiliated with the United Farm Workers of America.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>When we out-organized him, basically, and sent him back to <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Ohio</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>, he then went to the AFL-CIO and talked to the AFL-CIO and said, &ldquo;You have a renegade union over here that&rsquo;s negotiating a contract that should be under the AFL-CIO.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So it caused all sorts of problems with the Washington State Labor Council who was supporting us, because the AFL-CIO called them. The AFL-CIO asked Rick Bender to pull the Washington State Labor Council, to pull the support that they were giving us for that campaign because we weren&rsquo;t AFL.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They staved that off a lot and continued to support us, but finally it was &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to affiliate, Rosalinda and Kurt.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>You guys have to affiliate with an AFL union.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Valdemer Valasquez was in DC pushing, pushing, pushing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He wanted this contract.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So we decided to affiliate with the United Farm Workers of America.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Which a lot of people weren&rsquo;t happy with&mdash;because the UFW had no resources, we should have affiliated with a union that had more power, Teamsters, SEIU, UFCW.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The workers said, &ldquo;No, we want a Mexican union.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We want our own union, so that&rsquo;s the only one there is other than FLOC, which has shown that&rsquo;s not what we want.&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So we affiliated with the United Farm Workers of America.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Then I became an employee, me and Kurt both became employees of the United Farm Workers of America.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We continued negotiations, they sent out a representative, David Martinez to sit at the negotiation table.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We negotiated the contract and they signed off on it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They came out for the last two weeks of the election&mdash;Dolores Huerta came out, Arturo Rodriguez came out, various members of the leadership came out.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>We had the votes but they came out.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It gave us a lot of publicity. It was fine. It was a great victory.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Kurt decided to leave because his wife was from <ST1:STATE 
w:st="on">California</ST1:STATE> , so he decided to leave and go back to <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">California</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:STATE>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I stayed on, I was in the process of developing an organizing committee in the apple industry, and then I was asked to go help out the organizing campaign in <ST1:CITY 
w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Watsonville</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So I left Sunnyside to go help out.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe that was a mistake that I left <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:PLACENAME w:st="on">Washington</ST1:PLACENAME> <ST1:PLACETYPE w:st="on">State</ST1:PLACETYPE> </ST1:PLACE>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Because I was then the Northwest regional director for the United Farm Workers of America, and was administrating the contract with Chateau Ste. Michelle and we were in the process of developing the committee to the level where it was my goal to have them run the union office as a worker&rsquo;s center. Then from there they begin to organize in more industries, and they take the leadership in showing the workers.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But we didn&rsquo;t get that far.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I left in the summer of 1996 to go to <ST1:CITY w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Watsonville</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>, and I got back in February of 2003.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Things are very stalled.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s disappointing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;ve been talking to the committee at Chateau Ste. Michelle.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There&rsquo;s a lot that they can do, should have been doing, I think Martin Rios is the leader, as agreed to take a position as organizer for the United Farm Workers of America, so hopefully that will create a change.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>But right now, the only staff people are going to be him and Eric Nicholson, and Eric Nicholson is in <ST1:CITY 
w:st="on"><ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Tacoma</ST1:PLACE> </ST1:CITY>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That leaves Martin by himself in Sunnyside.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Martin has the training, the ability, the heart and the leadership that if he really focuses on it, he can build a union.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So we&rsquo;ll see what he does.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> I&rsquo;m not sure how many times the contract has been renegotiated.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think three times since 1995.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s a good contract.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s one of the best that the union has.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I know because I&rsquo;ve seen all their contracts now.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was on the Executive Board.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;m proud of it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I&rsquo;m very proud of it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s like giving birth to a child!<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The committee and I have always sworn to each other that we&rsquo;re never going to let anything happen to that contract, and we&rsquo;ll come together when needed no matter what to do what we need to do to make sure that it continues.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>You&rsquo;re talking over 200 families, and in <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:CITY 
w:st="on">Sunnyside</ST1:CITY> , <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Washington</ST1:STATE> </ST1:PLACE>, that&rsquo;s a lot of stable working people in a region that has third world conditions for farm workers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And it&rsquo;s honorable work, it&rsquo;s good work and it was won under some very difficult conditions and won in a very honorable way.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think it deserves a lot more credit than it&rsquo;s been given&mdash;the contract itself.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;ll see.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Hopefully now, Martin, can start taking more leadership.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Frankly, we didn&rsquo;t get the support that we needed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We asked for it. Tom&aacute;s is the only one that supported us, and Lupe Gamboa, who was working with Evergreen Legal Services at the time.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They weren&rsquo;t part of the core team.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They weren&rsquo;t part of the strategic team that came in and out.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What they helped to do was sedate some of the other guys [from the United Farm Workers of Washington State].<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We had no connection with the United Farm Workers of California until we were ready to affiliate in 1994, when we had brought the company to the table and we needed them to help negotiate.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What ended up happening, I&rsquo;ll never forget this: The company calls and their ready to sit down and negotiate.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So we&rsquo;re sitting there and Kurt says, &ldquo;Who here knows how to negotiate a contract?&rdquo;<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Martin goes, &ldquo;Chingow. One thing after another.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt goes, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure it out, one way or another.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It happened so fast and we were so into the campaign and making it happen.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The UFW knew how to negotiate contracts and brought somebody in and negotiated the contract.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We all sat at the table, me and Kurt , Joseph and the workers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That was an exciting time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It wasn&rsquo;t as much fun as what went on before.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was drudgery of language and documents and documents.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Trying to keep from choking the other guy and all that kind of stuff.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> There&rsquo;s a lot of sexism within our culture that just exists anyway.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This had never been done at this level in <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">Eastern Washington</ST1:PLACE> , and I wasn&rsquo;t from the area.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I am who I am and I just do what I do.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Somebody said, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t follow protocol by coming to us first,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;OK, so what?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Am I going to say I&rsquo;m sorry?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We&rsquo;re doing a campaign here, folks, for a union contract.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I always told them the only people I answer to is my committee, and here they are.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The committee itself began with Pastor Mejia, Martin Rios, Estela Ferrer, Reynaldo Cruz and Benito Martinez and Gerardo Rios.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Then later on we got more women, but this was the committee that came to me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So when these guys who were like the official leaders of the community&mdash;they literally called a meeting at the Radio Cadena office,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>where they all came and sat at the table and wanted to know what I was doing, what&rsquo;s going on, all this stuff. Kurt, Joseph and I went with Lupe and Tom&aacute;s, and I brought the committee, the workers came with us.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The only people I am accountable to is my committee, and I introduced them all.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>They said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the organizing committee of Chateau Ste. Michelle.&rdquo;<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know there was a committee at Chateau Ste. Michelle&rdquo; they said.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I told that I was doing what the committee needs done. <O:P></O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> Kurt had a fellowship he got to do the work, so part of that fellowship he used to pay himself and me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We got some grants, used some of that grant money to pay expenses.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Talking about salaries&mdash;sometimes we got paid, sometimes we didn&rsquo;t.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Like I said, my family and I lived with Kurt for a year.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Then we finally<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>moved out and got our own little place.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think at one point Kurt mortgaged his house to get money for us to continue working.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We got donations from people.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Beth Burrows, Helen Lee helped out.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>A lot of people helped out.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Rainbow Coalition sent us money.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>As we did our campaign throughout the state we got checks. <SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>Five-hundred, one-thousand&mdash;it was enough to keep us going.<O:P> </O:P><O:P>&nbsp;</O:P> I think it&rsquo;s the most beautiful, ideal grassroots campaign.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It worked out that way.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It&rsquo;s the way it should be and it&rsquo;s the way it can be, if people want to put their time and their effort into it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The thing is that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I didn&rsquo;t do anything but that.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>My father died in September of 1994, right in the height of the campaign, he became ill with cancer, right in the height of the campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I saw him maybe twice before he died, by the time my family called me he was at <ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on"><ST1:PLACETYPE w:st="on">Mt.</ST1:PLACETYPE> <ST1:PLACENAME 
w:st="on">Vernon</ST1:PLACENAME> </ST1:PLACE>hospital in a coma and I didn&rsquo;t get to talk to him.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was extremely difficult.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I couldn&rsquo;t leave the campaign, it was the most critical time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Kurt, Joseph and I were like that.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I mean, his wife was pregnant, all sorts of things were happening, but our priority was the campaign.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That was the decision we made.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The workers knew that was what it was for us, they recognized that.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Because we were doing it, they were doing it, and because they were doing it , so were we.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a total team effort.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We made do with whatever we could.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></font></P>
