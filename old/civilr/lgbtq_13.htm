    <div class="arial10">
      <p>Publicly led by the gospel singer Anita Bryant, a movement to use direct democracy to overturn municipal gay rights ordinances across the United States began in Miami-Dade County, Florida in 1977.&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious right&rsquo;s attack on gay rights was framed as a family values issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These activists employed the mantra &ldquo;Save Our Children,&rdquo; a slogan that implicated gay Americans as child molesters and people that actively recruited others to participate in the &ldquo;gay lifestyle.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing that a majority of voters did not like or, at the very least, did not understand homosexuality, gay rights advocates in Miami framed their campaign to protect nondiscrimination ordinances as an attack on a universal right to privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the voters of Miami-Dade County voted 70 to 30 percent in favor of overturning nondiscrimination for sexual minorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of 1978, gay rights activists in St. Paul, Minnesota and Wichita, Kansas followed the lead of activists in Miami, fighting democratic initiatives to overturn gay rights ordinances as an attack on privacy while the right continued making accusations about the &ldquo;gay agenda.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anita Bryant and the religious right were successful in St. Paul and Wichita, convincingly defeating gay rights ordinances by roughly two-to-one margins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Voters in Eugene, Oregon went to the polls two weeks after the vote in Wichita.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-gay rights movement felt more confident about their chances in Eugene given the city&rsquo;s reputation for social tolerance, and gay activists followed the lead taken in other cities to frame the ballot initiative as an attack on a universal right to privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, gay rights activists in all of the above municipalities failed to convince voters that their privacy was at stake by overturning nondiscrimination for sexual minorities.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
      <p>Anita Bryant&rsquo;s crusade against gay rights found its way onto two ballots in the November 7, 1978 General Election, but this time both were soundly defeated.&nbsp;&nbsp;California Proposition 6, nicknamed the Briggs Initiative after conservative California representative John Briggs, would have sanctioned the firing of gay and lesbian schoolteachers in all California public schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ballot initiative has received much attention from scholars and much publicity in the recent Hollywood biopic&nbsp;<em>Milk</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Political scientists have often explained Proposition 6 as a particularly mean-spirited and direct attack on gay people requiring the firing of gay teachers or straight teachers that discuss homosexuality, thereby putting off a majority of voters as too far a deviation from the status quo.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure also represented a blatant breach of privacy that voters likely could see extending beyond gay people.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same could not be said for Seattle&rsquo;s Initiative 13, which was analogous to the initiatives in Miami, St. Paul, Wichita, and Eugene.</p>
      <p>The Seattle City Council passed an employment nondiscrimination ordinance in 1973 that included sexual minorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinance also established the Office of Women&rsquo;s Rights, which would enforce cases of discrimination against women and sexual minorities.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975, the City Council added sexual minorities to the city&rsquo;s housing nondiscrimination ordinance.</p>
      <p>Insurance salesman Charlie Brydon arrived in Seattle in 1974 and quickly began organizing a new approach to local gay politics that looked very different from Gay Liberation.&nbsp;&nbsp;He formed the Dorian Group in 1975 to represent the interest of professional class gay men and lesbians.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Advocate&nbsp;</em>reporter Randy Shilts quotes Charlie Brydon in October 1975 as saying, &ldquo;The Dorian Group is reaching to a set of people who have never had a gay-identified group before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gay middle class are non-radical, conservative, establishment people who have never felt represented by any gay organization&hellip;They can come and be with people of the same socio-economic class.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added, &ldquo;When we (middle-class gay men and lesbians) start exercising our power, that&rsquo;s when the establishment starts taking civil rights seriously.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;These comments unsurprisingly angered community activists who had been active in gay liberation, socialist feminism, and other strands of radical sexual liberation that offered wider critiques of the social and political order. Brydon and the Dorian Group sought to remake the image of gay people from one of sexual deviants to one of respectable citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobbying the City Council to pass housing nondiscrimination for sexual minorities, the Dorian Group framed the issue as one of privacy, though the discourse of privacy could cut both ways on this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowners could also claim the right to privately sell or deny the sale or lease of their house to whomever they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, however, the City Council narrowly passed the ordinance by a five-to-four vote.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a></p>
      <p>While it is possible Seattle&rsquo;s nondiscrimination clauses covering sexual minorities benefitted from having these ordinances in place longer than in Miami, St. Paul, Wichita, and Eugene, Seattle also witnessed two distinct strategies led by different factions of the gay community, which both contributed to the defeat of Initiative 13. Led by Charlie Brydon, Citizens to Retain Fair Employment (CRFE) advanced the same argument as gay rights activists had in previous campaigns to protect nondiscrimination for sexual minorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Dorian Group, CRFE represented the interests of white professional class individuals who resisted identity politics and sought to portray themselves as respectable citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;These activists&rsquo; commitment to working within the system and their belief that gay identity politics would inevitably lose the fight to maintain nondiscrimination for sexual minorities directed them toward the politics of privacy that had taken hold of the liberal establishment in contrast to the identity politics of the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through polling, CRFE identified privacy as something nearly all Seattleites valued and sought to make that the issue at stake rather than gay rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prominent Seattle politicians both in city hall and in Olympia were also members of CRFE, as were a number of religious leaders, including the Catholic archbishop, and other heterosexual allies played prominent roles in directing CRFE&rsquo;s activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;CRFE raised enough money to show television spots against Initiative 13 declaring, &ldquo;Your privacy is at stake,&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>&nbsp;framing the issue as a broad attack on civil liberties.</p>
      <p>The Washington Coalition for Sexual Minority Rights, a coalition formed from a number of more radical groups that addressed sexual politics, spawned two organizations to fight Initiative 13 that utilized identity politics:&nbsp;&nbsp;the Seattle Committee Against Thirteen (SCAT) and Women Against Thirteen (WAT).&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that the politics of privacy had failed in all of the previous fights to protect gay rights around the country, these activists decided that the anti-gay politics from the right should be fought with pro-gay politics from the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;While these activists were predominantly white, they represented a larger cross-section of socio-economic classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both SCAT and WAT followed principles of radical democracy, functioning without identified leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, each organization was divided into committees to aid the campaign effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;While SCAT included both gay men and lesbians, WAT addressed the specific concerns of feminists &ndash; gay and straight &ndash; as the initiative also called for the disbanding of the Office of Women&rsquo;s Rights, placing cases of discrimination against women under the purview of the Office of Human Rights along with that office&rsquo;s preexisting workload of enforcing nondiscrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, class, religion, political beliefs, ability, and age.&nbsp;&nbsp;SCAT and WAT had far less money than CRFE, but these groups were able to run ads on buses, print campaign ephemera, and encouraged supporters to call local media and write letters to the editors of local papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;While CRFE emphasized a universal right to privacy at risk, SCAT and WAT insisted through their campaign slogan, &ldquo;Someone you know is gay,&rdquo; on publicizing gay men and lesbians rather than making them private.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
      <p>While CRFE reached out to more established liberal organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU-W) and the Urban League, SCAT reached out to more radical minority groups and knocked on doors in minority neighborhoods, framing the attack on gay rights as a slippery slope for all minority rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other issues on the ballot provided opportunities for coalitional politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiative 15 threatened to overturn City Council imposed restrictions on the use of force by the Seattle Police Department, and backers of Initiative 350 sought to end busing programs to achieve racial integration in schools across Washington State. While CRFE endorsed a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on Initiatives 15 and 350, SCAT and WAT sought to forge coalitions with anti-15 activists in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp;While no formal political group was formed to fight Initiative 15, minority voters particularly sought its defeat, especially after co-chair of the pro-13 organization Save Our Moral Ethics (SOME) Dennis Falk, a Seattle police officer, fatally shot a black man suspected of burglary.&nbsp;&nbsp;That man, John Alfred Rodney, was mentally challenged and only twenty-six years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident helped fuel coalitional activism to defeat both 13 and 15, as African Americans viewed the Office of Human Rights as having a large enough caseload without adding discrimination cases against women, a point WAT stressed as they advocated protecting the Office of Women&rsquo;s Rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest percentage of &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes on Initiative 13 came from the predominantly African American Central District, where voters decided 77 percent against the initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisive defeat of Initiative 13 in this community can be attributed to CRFE&rsquo;s outreach to the Urban League, the support of some African American preachers and councilmember candidate Norm Rice, the Rodney shooting, and SCAT and WAT&rsquo;s outreach to minorities and their efforts to frame 13 and 15 together.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRFE, SCAT, and WAT managed to engage in their own distinct brands of political activism, and together, these groups achieved a two-to-one defeat of Initiative&nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Initiatives 15 and 350 passed. While Seattle voters soundly voted to protect the rights of gay men and lesbians, they also supported giving policemen greater license to use firearms, and 63 percent of Seattle voters endorsed ending the city&rsquo;s busing program to achieve integration in public schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;For sexual minorities, nondiscrimination sufficed to fix a troubled historical past.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay men and lesbians had no need for affirmative action as they represent all racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seattleites supported this limited state action on behalf of sexual minorities, but refused to support an effort to address far more deeply and historically entrenched racial disparities in the city.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of CRFE, SCAT, and WAT demonstrated that a liberal-left coalition could achieve political goals in the right political climate without necessarily working together but without demonstrating themselves as a divided front either.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their collective victory in the fight against 13 gave the gay community power and recognition as a constituency in the social and political fabric of Seattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful campaigns for mayor and the City Council since 1978 have usually embraced gay rights and outreached to members of the gay community. The defeat of Initiative 13 solidified Seattle&rsquo;s reputation as a city tolerant of sexual minorities, and the city of Seattle has continued to welcome sexual minority migrants to the present day.</p>
