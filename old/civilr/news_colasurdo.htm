		<span style="font-family: Arial">On 
		December 7, 1941 Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, thrusting the United States into both 
		war and a state of hysteria. By the dawn of Monday December 8th, the FBI 
		had arrested hundreds of Japanese immigrants, many of whom would spend 
		the duration of the war in jail. These arrests would foreshadow the 
		plight of Japanese Americans on the West Coast for the next five years.
		</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost 
		over night the country had taken on a new sense of patriotism and a 
		belief in contributing to an all out war effort. Along the West Coast, 
		the supposed threat of Japanese dive bombers appearing in the sky at any 
		minute was palpable. Night-time black outs up and down the coast were 
		being enforced by the military. Soon all “enemy aliens,” any Japanese, 
		German, or Italian immigrants, would be locked out of areas that were 
		deemed necessary to defense along the West Coast. The hysteria would 
		finally culminate in President Roosevelt signing executive order 9102, 
		which established the War Relocation Authority on March 18, 
		1942. This order authorized the military to designate areas along the 
		coast from which all enemy aliens, both immigrants and native born, were to be 
		moved inland to relocation camps. On March 24, 1942, the first civilian 
		exclusion order was issued for Bainbridge Island, where forty five 
		families were given one week to be evacuated by the military.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle 
		area newspapers closely covered the evacuation. Their editorials fell into three categories: 
		some were for evacuation, some were against evacuation, and some were 
		ambivalent. This essay examines some of the smaller newspapers in the 
		region, weekly newspapers that served specialized communities: &nbsp;the<i> 
		Seattle Argus, West Seattle Herald,&nbsp; Bainbridge Review, Northwest 
		Enterprise, and Japanese American Courier.</i>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Argus</font></span></i></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>
		Argus</i> newspaper was a weekly publication edited by H. D. Chadwick. 
		The paper gave a general outline of issues from week to week, 
		highlighting areas such as business, courts, and city hall. The columns 
		were a mixture of reporting and opinion, making the whole paper seem 
		like an editorial. Though the <i>Argus</i> was for the evacuation order; 
		the editor took an unconventional approach to justifying his beliefs. In 
		a December 27, 1941 &nbsp;story entitled “Racial Prejudice”, the <i>Argus</i> 
		reported that there were reports of young Japanese Americans being 
		beaten by white “hoodlums” and that these actions were outrageous. The 
		article then made a distinction between Japanese and Japanese Americans: 
		“socially and commercially ostracized, the Japanese nationals in this 
		country face a bleak future, and for them we make no appeal at this 
		time. The American born Japanese, however, are deserving of exactly the 
		same tolerance that is enjoyed by, say, the American born Swedes. They 
		are Americans too, they are not enemy aliens.” The <i>Argus</i> drew a 
		distinction between being an immigrant and being second generation 
		Japanese American by arguing that only the latter was worthy of trust. 
		The editor showed a respect for the American born Japanese, and although 
		the issue of evacuation was not fully relevant at the time of this 
		story, the implication is that only Japanese nationals would have to be 
		evacuated.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">By February, the <i>Argus</i> had 
		changed its mind. In a Feb. 14, 1942 article titled “Young Japanese 
		Americans,” the <i>Argus</i> no longer made any distinction between 
		American born and Japanese nationals:</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This paper has taken 
		a pretty tolerant view of the young American Japanese in its discussion 
		of enemies in our midst. A news story this week inspires us to repudiate 
		every generous thought we have held toward these people. It is now 
		revealed that there are more Japanese students than white studying 
		German at Broadway high school, and that many of them took up the study 
		of German after the war began. (<i>Argus</i>, February 14, 1942 p.1)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The story went on to 
		condemn the government for allowing “American born Japs” and nationals 
		alike to “remain at large.” Finally, the story concluded that not all 
		Japanese and Japanese Americans may be guilty, but it was better to be 
		safe than sorry: “if the innocent are interned with the guilty, it will 
		not be a very serious matter. If any japs are allowed to remain at large 
		in this country, it might spell the greatest disaster in history.”(<i> 
		Argus</i>, February 14, 1942 p.1)</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost 
		three months into the war, the hysteria along the west coast was 
		beginning to shift direction. In the days following the bombing of Pearl 
		Harbor, the perceived threat was supposed to come from the skies in the 
		form of bombs and dive-bombing planes. As that threat seemed to be less 
		immediate, an idea of a fifth column at work in the country started to 
		take its place. Months earlier in December, Frank Knox, the Secretary of 
		the Navy, told the press that he believed a fifth column of saboteurs 
		was present in Hawaii before Dec. 7th. The fifth column was supposed to 
		include both Japanese immigrants and American born Japanese, lending 
		support to Japan in the form of spying, sending reports of American 
		actions to Japan, or even sabotage. The <i>Argus</i> applied these ideas 
		to local experience in its story, “The Fifth Column at Work,&quot; which 
		stressed that “japs are 
		employed at Harborview hospital. Japs are living in, and even operating, 
		hotels on the western slopes of Seattle’s hills. A jap stationed at 
		Harborview, another at west Seattle and a third at a point in the white 
		river valley could, by pre-arranged light flashes, establish a perfect 
		triangulation for the guidance of enemy planes to the Boeing plant…and 
		still we allow the japs to roam at will in this vital area.” (<i>Argus</i>, 
		February 28, 1942 p.1)&nbsp; The tone of this story is almost a plea for 
		something to finally be done, and it is right around this time that the 
		idea of evacuation is becoming more imminent. In fact, the February 28th 
		issue is the last time the <i>Argus</i> makes such pointed opinionated 
		stories against the Japanese Americans. There are a few stories in the 
		next couple of weeks, mainly stating facts about what the evacuations 
		will look like, and when they will happen. Once the issue of evacuation 
		became formal federal policy, the staff of the <i>Argus</i> did not 
		devote more time to the subject.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">West Seattle Herald</font></span></i></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>
		West Seattle Herald</i> was another weekly publication. Its columns were 
		very general; the front page had articles about one to two major 
		national or local stories, then the rest of the paper and articles were 
		specific to the west Seattle neighborhood which was almost completely 
		segregated through informal and formal prohibitions against non-white 
		homeownership or apartment renting. In the days following Pearl Harbor 
		up until mid February, there was no mention of the evacuation of the 
		Japanese Americans, nor any mention as to the way the paper felt about 
		Japanese Americans. Almost out of the blue, on February 26, 1942 along 
		the bottom of the front page read, “<b>Complete evacuation of aliens -- 
		a common sense move – why delay?” </b>There was no article on the front 
		page that would tie this statement into it. On page seven of the same 
		issue there was an editorial entitled “<b>GET ‘EM OUT!” </b>The piece 
		opens by sighting an incident in California where an enemy submarine was 
		supposedly guided by lights on a hill near Santa Barbara which triggered 
		the firing of anti-aircraft guns by the U.S. military. From this event, 
		the editorial states complained: “And yet we are still soft pedaling on 
		the issue of wholesale internment of alien enemies. When are we going to 
		get tough?....so long as we permit alien enemies to remain in our midst 
		we are playing with fire…..the government should initiate instant and 
		drastic orders sweeping all aliens, foreign or native born, so far 
		inland that we can forget them for the duration.”(February 26, 1942 p.7) &nbsp;Although this is the only issue in which the 
		paper or editor speaks to the internment issue, it is a clear example of 
		being fiercely in favor of the government acting against the Japanese 
		Americans.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The Bainbridge

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		</font> </span>
		</b><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">On Bainbridge 
		Island, there were a considerable number of Japanese American 
		families—most of them connected to various kinds of farming. The <i>
		Review</i>’s reaction to internment suggested that the Island’s Japanese 
		American population was deeply tied into every part of the community. 
		Bainbridge Island was the first place in the United States from which 
		all civilians of Japanese decent were evacuated by the military. This 
		fact makes the <i>Review</i>’s response to internment stand out. This 
		was one of the few newspapers in the country to take an editorial 
		position against internment.&nbsp; The publishers of the <i>Review</i> were 
		Walter C. Woodward and Mildred Logg Woodward.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In an editorial 
		entitled “More Plain Talk,” the <i>Review</i> lets its readers know 
		where they stood:</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">We spoke of an 
		American recoil to Japanese treachery and wrote: and in such recoil of 
		sentiment there is danger of a blind, wild, hysterical hatred of all 
		persons who can trace ancestry to Japan…who can say that the big 
		majority of our Japanese Americans are not loyal…their record bespeaks 
		nothing but loyalty: their sons are in our army…it [the Review] will not 
		dispute the federal government if it, in its considered wisdom, calls 
		for the removal of all Japanese. Such orders... will be based on 
		necessity and not hatred. (February 5, 1942 
		p.4)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The <i>Bainbridge 
		Review</i> is the only area newspaper that spoke this way. This piece 
		makes the connection between the Japanese Americans and how integrated 
		they are in the society. The article ended by trying to reason that the 
		hysteria that allowed people to consider internment should not lead to 
		the taking away of the rights of so many loyal citizens, rights that are 
		constitutionally guaranteed. </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 
		no official word of an exact date for evacuation would come until the 
		end of March, the March 5, 1942 issue of the <i>Review</i> made clear 
		the fact that residents on the Island knew that the Japanese Americans 
		would be leaving. In an editorial on the front page entitled, “Many Who 
		Mourn,” the <i>Review</i> put the issue into a very personal tone by 
		reminding everyone of the bigotry involved in the evacuations. The 
		review pointed out that the Japanese Americans would be shipped off to 
		unknown parts where they would not be welcomed. All but one governor 
		from the inland states opposed the relocation of the Japanese Americans 
		to their states. This same editorial brought with it an apology to the 
		Japanese American residents for not being able to do enough to have them 
		stay, and expressed a sense of failure: “The review— and those who think 
		as it does—have lost.”(March 5, 1942 p.1) </font> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Then on March 23 
		came the order for the evacuation of all Japanese Americans from 
		Bainbridge Island. The orders were now directed at the <i>Review’s</i> 
		own back yard, and from the articles and editorials in the March 26th 
		issue, it seems as though the <i>Review</i> had a new position to fight 
		for. In a front-page editorial entitled “Not Enough Time” in the March 
		26th issue, the <i>Review</i> shed light on many of the underlying 
		problems with the evacuation orders. First, the <i>Review</i> emphasized 
		the Constitutional rights of Japanese Americans by calling them citizens 
		and putting “not aliens” in parentheses. Even if the law of the land 
		discriminated against Japanese immigrants from becoming naturalized 
		citizens, their children, the American born Japanese, were supposed to 
		be afforded the same rights as all other Americans under the 
		Constitution. Second, the <i>Review</i> noted that there were three 
		months between Pearl Harbor and the evacuation orders, and in that time 
		there wasn’t any of the devious sabotage that people feared. It asked 
		why, if the FBI had been investigating and arresting all those who were 
		suspicious, everyone else have to suffer evacuation. The FBI, the <i>
		Review</i> noted, had already been to Bainbridge Island specifically to 
		search homes and make arrests. The <i>Review</i>’s blamed the government 
		for giving the order but added that “we say this on our own accord. It 
		is not an echo of anything we have heard a single Japanese say. They are 
		taking this treatment without a single bitter word. At least we have 
		heard none.”&nbsp; This closing statement by the <i>Review</i> suggests that 
		by enduring these orders, Japanese Americans once again proved their 
		loyalty, even when the orders themselves were unjust. </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The evacuation of 
		the Bainbridge Island Japanese Americans took one short week. However, 
		one of the most heartfelt editorials would come out of that week. In the 
		April 2nd issue, the <i>Review </i>published a story about the 
		soldiers who evacuated the Japanese Americans. The editors begin by 
		explaining that because of the war, it would not be appropriate to give 
		the names and locations of the soldiers. It is promised that when the 
		time is right, the review will publish all of the names of the soldiers 
		and commend them for the humane way in which they conducted themselves 
		in carrying out such difficult orders. The story goes on to quote one of 
		the unnamed soldiers as saying that the island’s Japanese Americans had 
		shown the soldiers such kindness and hospitality that this was the 
		hardest job he and his men had ever done.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The <i>Review</i> 
		did not speak for everyone on Bainbridge Island.&nbsp; Every couple of 
		issues, it published a column entitled “The Open Forum” to give its 
		readers a voice. In the April 2nd issue, J.J McRee criticized the 
		editors as puerile, complained that it was not the place of the <i>
		Review</i> to question the actions of the government, he then ended by 
		asking to stop his subscription. The following week brought a letter 
		from Orville Robertson, in which he explained that he would find a new 
		subscriber for the <i>Review</i> to make up for the loss of the 
		gentleman the week before. He goes on to say that “by perusing an 
		attitude of sympathetic understanding and fairness toward our citizens 
		of Japanese ancestry, and our friendly aliens who have for many years 
		chosen the American way of life, you are making an important 
		contribution.” (April 9, 1942 p.4) &nbsp;Among the 
		readers of the <i>Review</i> who chose to write in, the majority agreed 
		that the Japanese Americans deserved to be trusted as loyal Americans 
		just as those who were not of Japanese ancestry. Also among the letters 
		to the editor was testimony from evacuees who described their evacuation 
		to and incarceration in California. The April 16, 1942 (p.4) issue 
		published a letter from Nob. Koura, an evacuee, that thanked the <i>
		Review</i> for the stance that it took and for the help that it gave 
		toward making the evacuation easier. </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The evacuations 
		would continue in other parts of the area around Bainbridge Island; 
		however the fight had been taken out of the <i>Review</i>. Once the 
		Bainbridge citizens were gone, the <i>Review</i> turned back to the 
		weekly happenings of Island life. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Northwest Enterprise</font></span></i></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>
		Northwest Enterprise</i> was a weekly publication and the region’s most 
		prominent African American newspaper. On Friday, December 12, 1941 the
		<i>Enterprise</i> published an editorial by E. I. Robinson titled “Let 
		Us Keep Our Record Clear<i>.</i>” In it, the editor spoke about how 
		there was no need to lose one’s head or commit crimes in the name of 
		patriotism. He described the Japanese Americans as good citizens who 
		tend to their own business. But while this piece was the only one of its 
		kind to appear so close to December 7th and argued against harming 
		Japanese Americans just because of their ancestry, the <i>Northwest 
		Enterprise</i> did nothing to oppose internment, and did not mention the 
		plight of the Japanese Americans again.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Japanese American

		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>
		Japanese American Courier</i> was a weekly newspaper published and 
		written by Japanese Americans.&nbsp; James Y. Sakamoto was the paper’s 
		founder, its editor, its publisher, and its main voice. Under a 
		microscope of suspicion after Pearl Harbor, and already marginalized by 
		racism, Sakamoto and others at the <i>Courier</i> sought to assure the 
		nation of Japanese American worthiness of citizenship rights and showed 
		as many outward signs of their loyalty as they could. </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
		December 12, 1941, in its first issue since war broke out; the <i>
		Courier</i> published a page 2 editorial by Sakamoto that spoke of 
		meeting a common enemy. The common enemy was a way for Sakamoto to tell 
		his readers that those Japanese Americans who chose to stay in the U.S. 
		were now expected to do their part to help win the war against Japan. He 
		pointedly wrote that if there were any ties of support to Japan, those 
		ties were cut when Japan decided on war. This, along with other articles 
		in the December 12th issue, very clearly state that the Japanese 
		American people denounce Japan, and put their full support behind the 
		United States.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 
		next several months after Pearl Harbor, the <i>Courier</i> was the one 
		area newspaper that focused on the issue of what fate lay ahead for the 
		Japanese American people in World War II. Editorially, the paper did not 
		deviate from being loyal and patriotic at all costs. On Friday, March 
		6th, the title of Sakamoto’s editorial spoke for itself: &nbsp;“Let’s Obey 
		Order Loyally<i>.</i>” In this article, Sakamoto wrote that if Japanese 
		Americans were allowed to stay, then they would be able to help and 
		smash Japan in war, which he adds is what they would like to do. He also 
		explains what must happen, whether they want to or not, “When that order 
		comes from our government it must be obeyed loyally and cheerfully. A 
		basic tenet of loyalty is to obey the orders of the government to which 
		one owes his allegiance.”(March 6, 
		1942 p.2)&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">For Sakamoto, whether the evacuation orders were right or 
		wrong was less important than how Japanese American conducted 
		themselves.. Sakamoto was also a founding member of the Japanese 
		American Citizens League (JACL), another group through which Japanese 
		Americans stressed loyalty and obedience to the United States. In his 
		March 13th editorial, Sakamoto publicized and applauded the support the 
		JACL offered the government to help with evacuations. He quotes the JACL 
		as explaining to the government that whatever needs to be done will be 
		done cheerfully and smilingly. Sakamoto goes on to say that the 
		cooperation is splendid and that the young Japanese Americans should 
		accept the evacuation cheerfully and smilingly. </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Sakamoto’s writing 
		in his own newspaper contrasted sharply with his public pronouncements 
		about internment.&nbsp; Though his editorials eventually embraced internment, 
		he also publicly protested in a January 21, 1942 community meeting that 
		internment “would destroy all that we have built for more than one-half 
		century”</font><a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><font size="2">[1]</font></span></a></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Sakamoto must have 
		felt this loss keenly when the evacuation orders also brought an end to 
		the newspaper he had founded to combat xenophobia, embrace what he saw 
		as best in America, and promote the citizenship claims of Japanese 
		Americans. In the final, April 24th issue, Sakamoto gave a farewell 
		address entitled “Until We Meet Again”:</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">With this present 
		issue the <i>Japanese American Courier</i> suspends publication under 
		present conditions, after 14 years of service. The foundation stone of 
		the Courier has from the first been Americanism and the promotion of the 
		welfare of the nation. Our deepest regret is that we shall for the 
		present, not be able to carry on that work…after we have gone we ask our 
		fellow Americans to remember and to realize that we are at war. We think
