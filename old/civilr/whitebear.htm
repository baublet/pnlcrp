      <P class=arial10><span class="arial10">Bernie Whitebear (born Bernard Reyes) came into the world on September 27, 1937 at the Colville Indian Agency Hospital in the town of Nespelem on the Colville Reservation.<A

His mother was a Sin-Aikst  whose tribe made the Colville reservation home. His father was an immigrant from the Philippines who had arrived in America in 1912.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn5" title="" href="#_edn5" name=_ednref5><SPAN style="mso-special-character: footnote"><SPAN

Lawney Reyes, Whitebear&rsquo;s older brother, described their upbringing on the reservation as being extremely impoverished.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn6" title=""

Although they grew up in a home without running water or electricity, and hunted for their supper, the Reyes siblings thought little of it because they thought everyone lived like that.<A

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10"><span class="arial10">The poverty of the reservation was exacerbated by the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam and the resulting cultural and physical destruction that followed. For non-Native Americans, the dam stood as a symbol of progress; the electric turbines would power shipbuilding and plane construction industries west of the Cascades and the reservoir created by the 550ft high concrete embankment would give irrigation to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland. For the local tribes including the Sin-Aikst of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, however, the dam stood as a symbol of destruction and another reminder that the American government did not respect or care about Indian peoples. With the completion of the dam came the flooding of Kettle Falls, the flooding of their usual and accustomed grounds for berry picking and hunting, and even the flooding of their towns and ancestral grave sites.</span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10"><span class="arial10">The Grand Coulee Dam changed everything. Before the completion of the dam and the large reservoir that filled up behind it, now known as Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, the Sin-Aikst spent a significant part of their lives harvesting and processing salmon at traditional sites such as Kettle Falls. Because the dam did not include a fish ladder and thus prevented salmon from making it upstream, the Sin-Aikst and other members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation lost one of their central cultural and economic tenets; their cultural identity came into crisis and their already fragile economy became even more rigid and destined for poverty. In addition, the tribe was forced to relocate Bernie Whitebear&rsquo;s hometown, Inchelium. Houses, communities, and even their ancestors&rsquo; graves had to be relocated to higher, less productive land.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn9"

Whitebear learned the cultural, communal, and economic importance of land from an early age.</span></P>
      <P class=arial10>B<span class="arial10">ernie Reyes also learned the importance of personal relationships. In the absence of his mom, who divorced his father when Bernie was two years old, his older sister Luana stepped in and acted as a motherly figure, helping with his daily needs and preparing him for school, while Lawney taught Whitebear how to read the forest and fish for trout.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn10" title="" href="#_edn10"

Despite his mother&rsquo;s absence, his father continued to raise him on the reservation, as he was well liked in the community and accepted as one of their own. &ldquo;Because we were accustomed to hard times, we were able to survive. We had learned many times before what it was like to go without,&rdquo; Lawney recalls of the extreme condition of poverty in which they grew up.<A

Lawney remembers that during the winter of 1942, when Whitebear was 5 years old, they had to ration their food once the creeks froze over until a friend of their father was able to shoot a deer and give them a hindquarter.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn12" title="" href="#_edn12"

Bernie looked for work. Laura Wong-Whitebear, Whitebear&rsquo;s younger half sibling, recalls how Whitebear, despite how busy he may have been, always took time to care for his family. With a soft laugh she said that based on how many times she got Whitebear to drive her around to school events and places around town she felt like she was &ldquo;abusing&rdquo; him.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn16" title=""

While the rent was free, his job search proved unsuccessful until one day in the summer of 1956 he ran into Bob Satiacum, a Puyallup Indian, who offered to give him job fishing on the Puyallup River.</span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Bob Satiacum, like many other Puyallup and Nisqually Indians, relied on salmon fishing in the Nisqually river basin using canoes and drift nets as a form of subsistence, just like his ancestors had done for countless generations before him. Salmon fishing was such a vital component of Pacific Northwest Indian food and culture that during the signing of Indian Treaties in the 1850s by Washington tribes and Governor Stevens, tribes were adamant in including the &ldquo;<SPAN style="mso-fareast-language: JA">right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations&rdquo;<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn17" title=""

Deforestation, urban development, and dam construction for irrigation and hydroelectric power, combined with unsustainable commercial salmon harvest placed a large strain on the various species of salmon&rsquo;s ability to reproduce and thrive. While the number of salmon caught by Indian fishers was far lower than the number caught by commercial fisheries, game wardens routinely harrassed and arrested Indians for violating fishing regulations.<A

      <P class=arial10> During the late 1950s, some Indians began to take an  activist approach towards protecting their fishing rights, conducting &quot;fish-ins.&quot; When Bernie started his summer job of catching salmon with Bob Satiacum, he found himself in the middle of this campaign. Lawney recalls that Bernie wore feathers and traditional clothing during various fish-in protests, and often tried to infuse his humor and imagination into the potentially dangerous events.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn19" title="" href="#_edn19"

      <P class=arial10><span class="arial10">While working full-time  at Boeing, Whitebear still made time to visit with his family and the urban Indian community in Tacoma. He maintained his friendship with Bob Satiacum and continued to support the Puyallup and Nisqually Indians fighting for treaty and fishing rights. Satiacum and Billy Frank Jr., Nisqually, took the lead in advocating for their treaty-protected rights to fish through increased protests and events to catch the public eye and gain popular opinion. Not taking a lead role in the protests, Whitebear however did notice the power the Indian community had when it worked together to fight for civil rights issues. This inter-tribal Indian community that formed during the 1950s in Tacoma and many other cities throughout the United States was a relatively new phenomenon and a by-product of mid-century federal termination policy.</span></P>

Meyer, after 1950. Tribes across the country were targeted for termination, where jurisdiction of tribal lands would fall under the state and county where they were located, effectively eliminating tribal sovereignty. At the same time, government programs encouraged tribal members to relocate to cities where it was thought they would be forced to assimilate to Western culture.<A

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">The Indian community suddenly found themselves divided. While everyone agreed that building an Indian cultural and heritage center on the surplus fort&rsquo;s land would benefit the community, leaders favored two distinct approaches to acquire the land. One group, led by Pearl Warren, favored obtaining the land through passive negotiations with city council members after the city of Seattle had been granted the land. Others, led by Whitebear and Satiacum, influenced by the recent takeover of Alcatraz Island by San Francisco urban Indians the previous November of 1969, favored a more militant approach. </span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Student activist Richard Oakes led the 1969 occupation of Alcatraz Island, also government surplus land, and set the precedent for which Whitebear and Satiacum would follow. Amid the jagged rocks and cold November fog, Oakes read the Alcatraz Proclamation after he and nearly 80 other Indian activists, many students, used boats to reach the island that would be their home for the next several months. &ldquo;We, the Native Americans, reclaim the land known as Alcatraz Island in the name of all American Indians by right of discovery,&rdquo; the proclamation began.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn48" title="" href="#_edn48"

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Richard Oakes and the San Francisco urban Indians occupied the island of Alcatraz, sleeping, eating, and bonding with one another, for several months.

The press gobbled up the urban Indian occupation. All over the country and across the Atlantic, newspapers published headlines about the pioneering urban Indian community struggling to preserve their heritage and take care of their community in the hostile urban setting. It didn&rsquo;t take Whitebear or Satiacum long to catch the headlines and realize the similarities between their situation and that of Alcatraz. They realized that if they wanted to turn Fort Lawton into an Indian cultural center they were going to have to do it through similar militant protests. They had tried negotiations with mayor Uhlman and the Seattle city council and their voice was not heard. In their minds the only way to be heard would be through &lsquo;storming the fort.&rsquo; They spent several months planning with other Seattle Indian leaders such as Joe DeLaCruz and Randy Johnson, working out the details of the invasion. By March of 1970, they were organized and ready.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn49" title="" href="#_edn49"

      <P class=arial10> <span class="arial10">With support from the National Congress of American Indians, Whitebear was able to get a temporary freeze on the Fort Lawton land in November of 1970, which prevented the City of Seattle from obtaining it outright. This forced the city into negotiations with Whitebear and the UIATF and finally gave the Indians a legal footing for their assertion of the property. From July through November of 1971 meetings took place between the two groups as they negotiated who would control the surplus land. On March 29, 1972, two years after the original invasion, the UIATF was granted 20 acres of land on a 99-year lease, renewable at the end of the contract.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn60" title=""

Finally with the land from Fort Lawton, the United Indians of All Tribes could start to build a multi-use cultural center.

However, as fall came around and no news articles or reports made it into the FBI file, it appears as if this informant, just like the one who attempted to link Whitebear to a plot to use homemade explosives during the Fort Lawton take-over, may have exaggerated the potential threat in order to pique the FBI&rsquo;s interest. Most of the reports in the months after Fort Lawton are mundane descriptions of peaceful protests and meetings along with newspaper clippings and leaflets. By mid-1970 a lack of new reports in the file suggests that the FBI concluded that Whitebear and UIAT posed no threat for national security.</P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">The FBI file also records dissent and rivalries within the Seattle urban Indian population during this time.

But through programs like the UIATF&rsquo;s art mart and American Indian Tour &amp; Travel, Whitebear sought to place tribal representation back in the hands of tribal members. The travel agency worked with tribes to create tourist packages that included &ldquo;teepee encampments, salmon and buffalo barbeques, sport fishing, hiking, trail rides, canoe outings, river rafting, Indian foods, archaeological digs&rdquo; and more.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn95" title="" href="#_edn95"

These artwork and cultural programs therefore not only gave tribes and artists newfound recognition, but also helped them earn money and support themselves.</P>

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">The original plans for the development of the UIATF complex in Discovery Park called for a six-building complex. None received as much media attention as the three building complex People&rsquo;s Lodge. A grand events and performance hall, the People&rsquo;s Lodge was to have a 4,500 person auditorium, banquet hall for potlatch ceremonies, an archival storage facility, and a Hall of Ancestors, a place for Indian leaders to be commemorated for all of time.<A

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">The Magnolia community wanted to maintain the park&rsquo;s environmental and natural aesthetics and thought that the 123,000 square foot structure would ruin the park. As the park itself had less than 400 parking spaces they worried that the large events put on at the People&rsquo;s Lodge would cause a parking overflow into their neighborhood. They also questioned the fiscal viability of the project, worried that a lack of future funding would put a strain on Seattle parks funds and thus taxpayer dollars.<A

style="mso-endnote-id: edn100" title="" href="#_edn100" name=_ednref100><SPAN style="mso-special-character: footnote"><SPAN

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Although disappointed, Whitebear did not give up hope. When a plot of land became available for purchase by the city two years later in south Rainier, the UIATF reworked their original People&rsquo;s Lodge proposal and expanded it into Tahoma Park, an urban complex that contained office and retail space as well as the cultural amenities of the People&rsquo;s Lodge. In July of that year, however, their Tahoma Park lost out to the competing company&rsquo;s plans to turn the area into industrial development when the city council unanimously voted to sell the land to CX Corp.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn102" title="" href="#_edn102" 
name=_ednref102><SPAN 
style="mso-special-character: footnote"><SPAN

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Still not willing to abandon his plans for the People&rsquo;s Lodge, Whitebear found an opportunity once again the following year in 1979 when city land near Gasworks Park became available for purchase. This time Tahoma Park was reworked into an urban center complete with a restaurant featuring Indian food, retail shops, a banquet hall, fish hatchery, and small amphitheater, all built with architecture mimicking a Northwest costal village.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn103" title=""

This ruling put the lodge&rsquo;s plans on an inescapable hiatus despite Whitebear&rsquo;s continued lobbying up until his death in 2000.</span></P>

      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Whitebear had a knack for community organization. A concise and pragmatic speaker, he could effectively organize and unite groups of people under his leadership. But his real value as a leader came in knowing his place in the community and recognizing the importance of being a team player and maintaining close personal relationships with as many people as possible. His hard work and humility advanced the social and cultural needs of the urban Indian community not through confrontation and quarrels, but through compromise and understanding. This peaceful approach proved effective in lobbying for UIATF causes and garnering funds to carry out its programs.</span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">The big brother attitude that Laura remembers Bernie having when she grew up stuck with him his whole life. At a time when pan-Indianism was in its infancy and ancient tribal feuds still ran deep, Whitebear often acted as a mediator between tribes in order to achieve tribal unity within the urban Indian community.<A 
style="mso-endnote-id: edn104" title="" href="#_edn104" name=_ednref104><SPAN style="mso-special-character: footnote"><SPAN

Laura remembered him as the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; guy within the Indian community, for jobs, family problems, or just to have a friendly lunch. Garner remembers him as being easy to work with and a positive influence in the workplace.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn105" title="" href="#_edn105"

Laura recalls that just months before his death in 2000 from cancer he would leave his doctor&rsquo;s office with explicit instructions to go home and rest.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn106"

And because he was her big brother, she had to agree. </span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">His financial lobbying was just as persistent. He understood that in order to maintain the funds UIATF needed to support the urban Indian community he would need to maintain close personal ties with as many influential leaders as possible. He frequently made trips to and campaigned for funds in Seattle, Olympia, and Washington D.C. lobbying for regional and national grants. He also put on a multitude of fundraisers and community events to raise publicity and money for the foundation.</span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">One of the fundraisers his brother Lawney remembers particularly well was when Whitebear came across July 1970 Playboy playmate Carol Willis at a conference in Chicago on problems facing minorities.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn107" title="" 
href="#_edn107" name=_ednref107><SPAN 
style="mso-special-character: footnote"><SPAN

Bernie got Carol to agree to put on a show in Seattle where half of the event&rsquo;s profits would go towards benefiting the urban Indian community. Lawney was proud of his brother&rsquo;s hard work to win money for the community and glad that Bernie&rsquo;s house was too small so that Carol had to stay at his house for the few nights she was in Seattle.</span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">Whitebear&rsquo;s civic engagement and commitment to peaceful solutions to social problems is also impressive. In late 1979, the YMCA ran into trouble with Indian leaders through their Indian Guide and Indian Princess program.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn108" 
title="" href="#_edn108" name=_ednref108><SPAN 
style="mso-special-character: footnote"><SPAN 
style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[108]</SPAN></SPAN></A> The program, promoted by the YMCA as a mentoring program, was criticized for ignorantly imitating Indians and their culture through the use of headbands and war-whoops in the classroom. Instead of calling for the outright removal of the program, Bernie led other minority leaders and met with the YMCA in a series of discussions aimed to culturally sensitize the program so that Indian students would not be offended. In the end, he was able to work with the YMCA to eliminate the Indian stereotypes and turned the experience into a tool for teaching about the various Indian cultures of the United States. Whitebear even provided the YMCA with UIATF educational materials. His compromising approach served to strike harmony in the community between the Indian and non-Indian populations and increased the number of venues in the city&rsquo;s education system that spread awareness of Indian culture.</span></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal> <span class="arial10">In the decades after Fort Lawton, Whitebear took part in a number of task forces and initiatives in the school system aimed at producing fair representation of Indians and Indian culture in Seattle. In 1980 Whitebear joined a 12-person task force to review admission policies for minorities at the UW after critics noted that new policies excluded the fair admission of minorities.<A

style="mso-fareast-language: JA">We are talking about symbols of races, of people. If they decide to keep the name, then they are challenged to develop a representation of that culture with dignity,&rdquo; commented Whitebear.<A

      <P class=arial10> The culmination of his partnership with other minority leaders in Seattle came in the 1980s with the creation of the Minority Executive Directions Coalition.<A style="mso-endnote-id: edn111" 
title="" href="#_edn111" name=_ednref111><SPAN

Together with the other minority leaders, Whitebear learned that much could be accomplished through unity. The coalition sought to work together to bring common hardships and grievances to the attention of city officials and mass media. They worked together with over 70 community organizations to secure grants for the funding of social services, to carry out programs, and to spread knowledge about the various minorities living in Seattle.<A

      <P class=arial10> Bernie Whitebear died on Sunday July 16, 2000 after losing a 3-year battle with colon cancer. After he was diagnosed, Governor Gary Locke proclaimed Whitebear &ldquo;citizen of the decade&rdquo; and declared the month of October as &ldquo;Bernie Whitebear Month.&rdquo;<A

His march on Fort Lawton, development of UIATF and many social services and programs for children and adults, and endless community involvement have changed the way urban Indians live in Seattle. Old Cashmere&rsquo;s blessing, given when Bernie was only a young child on the reservation, certainly followed him his whole life as he peacefully fought against the multitude of problems facing the urban Indian during his lifetime. In a news article from 1997 he used an image from <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Star Trek</I> telling the <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Seattle Times</I> reporter that when he dies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll become an Indian trekkie, and I&rsquo;ll go where no Indian trekkie has gone before.
