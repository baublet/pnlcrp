<p>Yolanda Alaniz was born in 1950 in Texas.  Shortly thereafter, her family moved to the Yakima Valley of eastern Washington where her parents worked in the  fields.</p>
<p>In 1969, Alaniz enrolled in the University of Washington and soon became involved in progressive causes.  She was an active and influential member in  Chicana/o rights organizations like MEChA and the Brown Berets.  In 1975, while working as a student-employee, Alaniz was a central figure in the student strike to protest the firing of two Chicano administrators.  A journalist, she also wrote articles about women's rights for the <em>UW Daily</em>.</p>
<p>After graduating from UW, she moved to Los Angles where she became an organizer for the Freedom Socialist Party and continued to fight for progressive causes and Chicana/o rights.  Alaniz also became an active member of Radical Women, a feminist-socialist organization. </p>
<p>Today, Alaniz works as an archivist and writer.  In 1998, she co-edited the anthology, <em>Voices of Color</em>, which recounts the experiences of many activists in the Chicano movement.  In 2006, with Megan Cornish, Alaniz published her second book, <em>iViva la Raza!: Chicano Identity and Resistance</em>. </p>
Yolanda Alaniz discussed her activist history in an interview with Edgar Flores and Michael Schulze Oechtering Castenada. To the right are streaming-video excerpts of the
            interview in windows media format.
