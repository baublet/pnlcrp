           	<p class="arial10">Lawrence &ldquo;Larry&rdquo; Y.  		Matsuda was born in Minidoka Internment Camp in 1945 and grew up in a  		predominantly Japanese American community near Seattle&rsquo;s International  		District.&nbsp; He attended the University of Washington beginning in  		1963, earned his BA degree in 1967 and later an MA and Ph.D. He served  		six years in the Army reserve while finishing his education and  		beginning a career as an educator.</p>
			<p class="arial10"> During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Matsuda contributed to a number  		of different campaigns in a growing local Asian movement.&nbsp; While  		teaching at Sharples Junior High School (now named Aki Kurose Middle  		School), he created the state&rsquo;s first Asian American history course.&nbsp; As  		an active member of the Asian Coalition for Equality (ACE), he was part  		of a group of students that pushed the University of Washington to  		create an affirmative action program for Asian Americans.&nbsp; He served on  		the Japanese American Citizen&rsquo;s League (JACL) committee that created the  		&ldquo;Pride and Shame&rdquo; museum exhibit in 1970. That exhibit helped inspire  		the Redress Movement that ultimately secured an apology and reparations  		from the U.S. Congress. And Matsuda was active in the 1972 campaign that  		elected Washington state&rsquo;s first Asian American State Legislator, John  		Eng.</p>
			<p class="arial10"> Matsuda&rsquo;s autobiographical essay, &ldquo;A Professor, Not a Porter,&rdquo; in <i> <a href="http://commerce.peterlangusa.com/genBook.asp?CategoryName=Counterpoints%3A++Studies+in+the+Postmodern+Theory+of+Education&CategoryType=All+Series&ProductID=0%2D8204%2D6844%2D4"> Community and Difference</a></i> documents his nearly 40 years of  		professional experience as an Asian American educator. He is currently a  		Visiting Professor in Seattle University&rsquo;s College of Education and  		chair of SU's Remembrance Garden Committee.</p>
			<p class="arial10">On  		December 8th, 2005, the <i>Northwest Asian Weekly</i> honored  		Professor Matsuda with a Lifetime Achievement Award.&nbsp; You can read its  		description of his achievements in the article: <a href="http://www.nwasianweekly.com/20052447/past20052447.htm">&quot;Past  		Injustice Drives Matsuda.&quot;</a> &nbsp; We are also pleased to publish his poem, titled <a href="Too%20Young%20to%20Remember%20Minidoka.htm">&ldquo;Too Young to  		Remember Minidoka, Idaho.&rdquo;</a></p>
			<p class="arial10"> Larry Matsuda agreed to share memories in a videotaped interview  		conducted by  Allison Shephard and Trevor Griffey on November 3, 2005.&nbsp;             <p align="left"><img src="images/headshots/matsuda-early243.jpg" alt="Larry Matsuda- Photo from college years" width="243" height="324">
