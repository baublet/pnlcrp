		<span style="font-family: Arial; "><font size="2"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The <i>Quileute 
		Independent</i> began publication in 1908&nbsp;in La Push, Washington. Its 
		editor, W.H. Hudson was a member of the Quileute tribe who had attended Chemawa 
		Indian School, near Salem, Oregon. The next year the newspaper changed 
		its name to the <i>Quileute Chieftain</i> with Hudson continuing as 
		editor. Six issues of the combined newspaper are available on microfilm 
		at the University of Washington Library &nbsp;</font></span></p>

		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “...[A]t 
		that time [the 1840’s] the Pacific was never known to get too rough, 
		but, since the coming of the white man, the ocean appears to be rough 
		most of the time.”&nbsp; These words, printed in <i>The <u>Quileute</u> 
		Chieftain<u> </u></i>newspaper in 1910, show just one of the perceived 
		effects that the coming of white settlers had on Native Americans during 
		the era of manifest destiny in the United States.&nbsp; However, the water 
		being a “little rough” seems to be a gross understatement; the 
		compounded effects of white influence on the natives is better equated 
		to the devastating terror of a tsunami.&nbsp; After being uprooted and 
		relocated to a one-square mile reservation and introduced to 
		“civilization” by white settlers, the Quileute tribe lost much of its 
		previous way of life.&nbsp; The Quileutes, like other tribes of the United 
		States, saw many of its members drowning in the undertow of government 
		dependence.&nbsp; These natives of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state 
		discovered that their best chance for surviving the oppressive wave of 
		white culture was to embrace the ways of those who sought to assimilate 
		them.&nbsp; As is evident by the views expressed in <i>The <u>Quileute</u> 
		Independent</i> and its later counterpart <i>The Quileute Chieftain</i> 
		(published 1908-1910,) many Quileutes altered their traditional 
		religious beliefs and accepted the white man’s education in pursuit of a 
		better future.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first 
		contact between the Quileutes and the whites is best expressed in a 
		popular story among the members of the tribe.&nbsp; According to Quileute 
		folklore, in the 1850’s a large steamship full of white settlers ran 
		into a rock at James Island, near La Push, where the Quileute 
		Reservation is now located.&nbsp; The Quileutes entertained and took good 
		care of the men who had wrecked in exchange for some of the strange 
		items the whites had onboard: flour, dried fruit, and gold coins.&nbsp; Then, 
		according to the oral accounts of Quileute lore taken by Leo J. 
		Frachtenberg in 1915 and 1916, “one White man came to Quileute-land. . . 
		. All the Quileute knew the name of the good white man” (Andrade, 209).&nbsp; 
		This man was Isaac I. Stevens, governor of Washington Territory, who was 
		sent to make a treaty with the Quileutes in the mid 1850’s.&nbsp; Because the 
		Quileute land was so remote, the natives were not forced to move, and in 
		1889 President Cleveland set up the reservation at La Push that still 
		exists today.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before 
		the Quileutes were confined to their reservation, the tribe felt the 
		effects of the influx of settlers.&nbsp; As told by Hallie George, a 
		half-blood Quileute, to Frachtenberg: “Then not many years afterward 
		[after Steven’s visit] the White people came to where the Quileute used 
		to live.&nbsp; They drove away the Indians forbidding them to live where they 
		used to live. . . .They were deprived of all their land by the White 
		people” (Andrade, 211).&nbsp; Not only were the settlers taking land from the 
		Quileutes, they were also starting to take away the language and 
		traditions of the tribe.&nbsp; Seven years prior to the creation of 
		reservation boundaries, a school was set up in La Push by Mr. and Mrs. 
		A.W. Smith, who sought to anglicize and educate their pupils.&nbsp; The 
		Quileutes were given names from the Bible and American history.&nbsp; Many 
		names that appear throughout The <i>Quileute Chieftain</i> and <i>
		Quileute Independent </i>prove this: the editor’s name is W.H. Hudson, 
		and employees and frequently mentioned names of the paper have names 
		such as William Penn and Robert E. Lee.&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">W.H.

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this 
		paper was printed from 1908-1910, the editor was probably a member of 
		the first generation of Quileutes to be educated in the Indian schools 
		run by whites.&nbsp; Along with the reservation education at the Quileute 
		school, which is described as “the good influence Mr. Smith had over the 
		Indians” (<i>Chieftain</i> 2 Feb. 1910, p2), W.H. Hudson also attended 
		Chemawa Indian School, near Salem, Oregon.&nbsp; Because there are very few 
		bylines in the paper, the reader must assume that the editor is writing 
		the majority of the articles.&nbsp; The views presented in the articles are 
		obviously based on the type of education Hudson had.&nbsp; At Chemawa, like 
		many other Indian schools of the time, Native Americans were sent away 
		from their families to remove the child “from the hindering influences 
		of his home” (<i>Chieftain</i> n1, p4).&nbsp; The children were dressed and 
		taught to look and act white, often spending time with white families to 
		learn customs first-hand.&nbsp; Thus, it is not surprising that throughout 
		the papers, the white culture is the standard to which the success of 
		the Native Americans was measured.&nbsp; This is not to say that Hudson did 
		not have pride in his people; he sincerely wanted to see his race 
		furthered in society.&nbsp; However, the only way he saw to accomplish this 
		goal was to promote white education and religion.&nbsp; To do this, he used 
		two strategies; he constantly labeled Native American traditions and 
		culture as being detrimental to the advancement of his people, and he 
		promoted the acceptance of white education and religion.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negative 
		views of past traditions are clearly shown in an article entitled “Our 
		Christmas:” “Mr. Web. Jones began the ceremonies by singing his ever 
		favorite primitive songs which our ancestors used to entertain their 
		host and host[e]ss in the past days.&nbsp; It is interesting more than 
		astonishing to watch the festivities of these older class of Indians and 
		note the difference between the ‘old and new’” (<i>Independent</i> 21 
		Jan. 1909, p1).&nbsp; With these words, the reader comes away with the sense 
		that the Quileute songs and traditions were nothing more than 
		entertainment to the younger generations; the editor portrayed the past 
		as having little relevance to the educated, modern Quileutes.&nbsp; 
		</font> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The older 
		generations were also depicted as being against the furthering of the 
		education, and therefore against the societal advancement, of the 
		Quileutes: “However, unlike the past generations of Indians the present 
		ones believe in the education of our pale-face brothers and are sending 
		pupils to school at home or abroad” (<i>Chieftain</i> 27 Jan 1910, p2).&nbsp; 
		To cite another example, in a later article, to be uneducated was to 
		fall “back to the customs of the old Indians.&nbsp; We hope that this will 
		not continue to be so” (<i>Chieftain</i> 9 Feb. 1910, p2).&nbsp; The ways of 
		the older Indians were thought of as important only for posterity’s 
		sake.&nbsp; “Over fifty years ago before civilization was known to the 
		Indians, many interesting events were going on annually, which were not 
		kept on record. . . .If&nbsp; there were any historian in our midst a long 
		article could be made. . .” (<i>Chieftain</i>, 9 Feb. 1910, p1).&nbsp; The 
		events of the past are merely thought of as “interesting” and worthy 
		only to be remembered for historical purposes.</font></span></p>

		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 
		the papers have quite a few references to the past, the main aim of The<i> 
		Quileute Independent</i> and the <i>Chieftain</i> was to prepare Native 
		Americans for the future, “to open the eyes of the Indian population in 
		the great Western country so that they will realize their opportunities 
		are equal to that of the white man” (<i>Chieftain</i> 2 Feb. 1910, p2).&nbsp; 
		Not only was the paper aimed towards Indians, it was also aimed toward 
		“those who do not believe that the Indian is capable of ability and 
		capacity” (<i>Chieftain</i> 2 Feb. 1910, p1).&nbsp; This refers to the white 
		population in general, those who put the Indians on the reservations, 
		“where they instead of advancing, were miserable paupers.” (<i>Independent</i>,
		17 Dec.1908, 
		p3).&nbsp; Hudson sought to reverse this process of degeneration; the first 
		step in his plan was through education.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every 
		edition of the newspaper (there are six available in the University of 
		Washington library system), articles on the importance of education are 
		featured multiple times.&nbsp; Along with lengthy advertisements and 
		descriptions of out-of-state Indian schools, such as Chemawa in Oregon 
		and Carlisle in Pennsylvania,&nbsp; The<i> Quileute Independent</i> /<u> </u>
		<i>Chieftain</i> explained in detail about the benefits of a good 
		education.&nbsp; One of the most persuasive articles related education 
		directly to future earnings.&nbsp; By comparing the wages of educated and 
		uneducated men, the editor calculated that every day a child stays in 
		school is “equal to the gain of ten dollars” (<i>Independent</i> 17 
		Dec.1908, p1).&nbsp; He claimed that an educated man will make 22,000 dollars 
		more in his lifetime than his uneducated counterpart.&nbsp; By publishing 
		schoolchildren’s work in the paper and praising those children who were 
		accepted to Indian schools, Hudson was showing the public how Indians 
		can learn, as well as positively reinforcing the children with publicity 
		of their accomplishments.&nbsp; He also proposed academic activities, such as 
		the formation of a debate club by the young men of La Push, because “it 
		develops the brain” (<i>Chieftain</i> 27 Jan 1910, p3).&nbsp; </font> </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hudson 
		called for education, not only for children, but for Quileutes of all 
		ages.&nbsp; He believed that “Book[s] of vast knowledge [were] needed in 
		every home where one is able to read at all” (<i>Independent</i>, 17 Dec.1908, 
		p2).&nbsp; One article, entitled “Getting an Education,” discussed the 
		process of learning as continual throughout life: “One’s real education 
		begins before he ever sees or hears of a school, and never ends while he 
		lives” (<i>Chieftain</i>, 9 Feb. 1910, p1).&nbsp;&nbsp; Hudson argued that his 
		people could learn something every day, even if they were not in a 
		formal school setting.&nbsp; Classroom facilities were not available to the 
		older Quileutes who desired to learn, and this was a significant 
		hindrance to their opportunities for education.&nbsp; Even if all the Native 
		Americans in La Push desired to learn to read, there simply was not 
		enough room in the small school house to instruct them.&nbsp; For this 
		reason, Hudson offered a solution: “. . .a church is where we can 
		receive our education, even if it is the house of worship, if we are 
		above school age” (<i>Chieftain</i>, 9 Feb. 1910, p2).&nbsp; Although this 
		quote does not directly call for worship in the church, many other 
		articles in the <i>Chieftain</i> and the <i>Independent</i> display the 
		pervading underlying sentiment in the paper that encourages Christianity 
		among the Quileutes.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700">
		<font size="2">Shakers</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example 
		of this religious encouragement, evident in the very first article in 
		the inaugural edition of the <i>Independent</i>, was titled “Shaker 
		Religion Among Indians” (<i>Independent</i>, 17 Dec.1908, 
		p1).&nbsp; This was a detailed description about the origin of the Shakers 
		(not to be confused with the religious group on the East Coast) and an 
		overview of their beliefs.&nbsp; This religious sect originated near Olympia 
		where an Indian man named John Slocum claimed to die and arise to tell 
		his friends that he had been to heaven.&nbsp; He was sent back by God to tell 
		his fellow Indians how to be good Christians.&nbsp; John’s wife became a 
		follower of Christianity and when John suddenly became ill again, she 
		began shaking when she approached him and he improved dramatically.&nbsp; 
		This shaking became an important part of the Shaker religious 
		ceremonies, especially when praying for the sick or dead.&nbsp; The goal of 
		the Christian group was purported to be, “to follow the footsteps of our 
		Christian brethren of the white race, even though [the Shakers] are 
		worshipping in different manner. . .” (<i>Independent</i>, 17 Dec.1908, 
		p1).&nbsp; Another article in the same paper was a reprint from a newspaper 
		from New York called <i>The Indian’s Friend</i>.&nbsp; Along with education, 
		it states that “the Indian must have [C]hristian training and influence 
		for his hard fight in character-building” (<i>Independent</i>, 17 Dec.1908, 
		p2).&nbsp; This choice of articles by Hudson definitely shows his bias 
		towards Christianity, as other religions, even native ones, are very 
		rarely portrayed in the newspaper.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it 
		appears that Hudson supports Christianity, his specific allegiance to 
		the Shakers was probably due to the fact that they were the only 
		organized religious group in La Push.&nbsp; He wrote an editorial entitled 
		“Do We Need a Church?” that almost begged religious officials to set up 
		a Protestant building of worship on the reservation.&nbsp; Hudson states: 
		“Not a single missionary has ever been sent here to make an attempt to 
		Christianize the Quileutes” (<i>Chieftain</i>, 27 Jan 1910, p3).&nbsp; He 
		continued by asserting that the Indians believe in Jesus, even if their 
		mode of worship is odd.&nbsp; “A visitor will come in the Shaker Church and 
		look upon it as foolishness, but to the members it is a blessing. . . 
		They say they do not pray to any false god, but to whom our white 
		brothers call Jesus.”&nbsp; At the end of the article he assured any pastor 
		interested in starting a congregation in La Push that the community was 
		very willing to pay money to keep the church running.&nbsp; In another piece, 
		Hudson showed the societal value of a church: “One thing we believe 
		which is needed most, is the Church, where we can receive proper 
		religious training, so that we can learn to attend churches when we are 
		out in the civilized world an[d] be respected . . .” (<i>Independent</i>, 
		4 Feb. 1909, p2).&nbsp; This is not so much a call for the teachings of Jesus 
		Christ, but for the teachings of white society.&nbsp; He went on to say about 
		the Shakers: “. . . this would be an ideal society [one with a church] 
		for the Indians did they adhere to their creed and omit the shaking and 
		excitement.”&nbsp; Hudson clearly agreed with the white authorities of the 
		time that shaking was not civilized.&nbsp; These authorities posted 
		regulations regarding appropriate times to hold Shaker meetings in order 
		to control the people who shook day and night (Powell, 42).</font></span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because 
		Hudson was trying to convince his people to assimilate to the dominant 
		white culture, he made an effort to show examples of Indians who had 
		become important members of white society.&nbsp; In several issues he 
		highlighted local businessmen and wrote about their educational and 
		business achievements.&nbsp; One such article about Indian advancement, 
		“Another Indian Honored,” described a young man who returned to his 
		Indian school as a teacher and was elected “by the Prohibition party as 
		a presidential elector” (<i>Independent</i> 17 Dec.1908, 
		p1).&nbsp; Not only did this man have a prestigious position, he was clearly 
		against the use of intoxicating beverages, consumption of which has been 
		a problem to Native Americans since their introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hudson also 
		took an active part in helping his fellow Native Americans, especially 
		children.&nbsp; In the January 21, 1909 issue of the <i>Independent</i>, he 
		announced his intention to “visit nearly every Indian agency and the 
		work printing among the Quileute boys will be introduced to other people 
		who like to see the Indian rise to higher stage of civilization”&nbsp; (<i>Independent</i> 
		21 Jan. 1909, p2).</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W.H. 
		Hudson’s papers were an attempt to help his Quileute brothers and 
		sisters advance and assimilate to the dominant wave of white culture.&nbsp; 
		He truly believed that his race was just as capable as the white race 
		and that his people were making slow steps toward progress.&nbsp; His view 
		was also held by members of the community who contributed pieces to the 
		paper.&nbsp; Jim Ward, a Quileute, sums up the assimilated native views of 
		Indian advancement well:</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin-left: 9px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A few generations ago 
		the Indians could not do much of anything.&nbsp; They could not do one thing 
		which the white people could do. . . .But today they can do just&nbsp; 
		as well as any white man. . . .The progress of the Indian is growing 
		very rapidly&nbsp;. . . .We are desirous to learn white people’s ways.&nbsp; We do 
		not desire to do what &nbsp;our Indian friends used to do long ago.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">As is evidenced in this 
		quote, other Quileutes shared in Hudson’s views of the Indian’s adoption 
		of the white man’s ways.&nbsp; However, the power that Hudson held over his 
		tribe is unclear.&nbsp; He may have been a leader of these people, convincing 
		his readers that by receiving white education and practicing 
		Christianity, Native Americans could become equal to the white man.&nbsp; On 
		the other hand, Hudson could have been just a vocal member of his tribe, 
		a voice through which the views of the majority of the community spoke.&nbsp; 
		In either case, these newspapers show the importance to some Quileutes 
		of assimilation for survival -- the importance of letting the waves of 
		white religion and education wash the Native Americans clean of their 
		traditional beliefs and values. </font> </span></p>
