        <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">When two young 
          African American students were suspended from Seattle's Franklin High 
          School in March of 1968 after an altercation with a Caucasian student, 
          who was not reprimanded, the stage was set for one of the most 
          significant events of the Seattle civil rights movement. Following the 
          suspensions, Franklin's black students were in an uproar. They 
          immediately contacted a group of African American students at the 
          University of Washington who had been trying to start a Black Student 
          Union at Franklin. This essay explains the involvement of this group of 
          college students in the fight to earn equal opportunities for African 
          American students. The sit-in at Franklin High that they helped engineer 
          was one of the first Black Power demonstrations in Seattle. It rattled 
          the surrounding community, inspired the formation of the Seattle chapter 
          of the Black Panther Party, and brought the existence of a militant 
          civil rights movement in the Pacific Northwest to the attention of the 
          entire nation. </span></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There is some 
          confusion about the origins of the sit-in at Franklin High. Larry 
          Gossett remembers the principal of Franklin, Loren Ralph, suspending two 
          female students for wearing a popular hairstyle for African Americans, 
          known as the Afro.&nbsp; Gossett recalled that Ralph told the young women 
          that they could return to school when they learned to look more 
          &ldquo;lady-like.&quot;<a name="_ednref2" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn2"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[2]</span></span></a><span class="EndnoteRefe"></span></span><span class="EndnoteRefe"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline"><br clear="all" style="page-break-before: auto">

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Contemporary sources 
        reveal a different story, however. The demonstration was prompted by Ralph&rsquo;s 
        decision to suspend two African American students who were involved in a 
        hallway scuffle on March 28, 1968. Three male students took part in the 
        fight, however only cousins Charles Oliver and Trolice Flavors were 
        reprimanded. The third participant, who was Caucasian, was not. While 
        Oliver&rsquo;s suspension would not take effect until the following Monday, 
        Flavors was accused of making a physical threat to Franklin vice Principal 
        Charles F. Shearer and was suspended immediately and indefinitely.&nbsp; 
        Concerned about the welfare of his education, Flavors, a senior, requested 
        to speak with Ralph in order to negotiate his suspension and contest the 
        alleged threat to Shearer.&nbsp; When it became apparent to Flavors that he would 
        not be reinstated, he contacted his mentor, Carl Miller, who was a member of 
        the Black Student Union at the University of Washington.<a name="_ednref3" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[3]</span></span></a> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The Black Student Union 
        (BSU) was a new organization on the University of Washington campus. Founded 
        January 6, 1968 by members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 
        (SNCC), it cultivated the appreciation of African American culture and 
        social reform for minority students. Comprised of predominately black people 
        from the United States, Africa, and other countries, the University of 
        Washington BSU was part of a nationwide movement of black student 
        organization in the late 1960s. Targeting university curriculum and hiring 
        practices, the BSU hoped to &ldquo;Establish a cohesive union of black students, 
        black faculty, other black organizations, and the community to facilitate 
        educational opportunities.&quot; According to the group's mission statement, &quot;BSU 
        exists to enhance cultural awareness, political awareness, social events, 
        and to provide support for the students and the community.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref4" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[4]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        Charging the university with insensitivity toward black heritage, the 
        organization&rsquo;s activism laid the foundation for the American Ethnic Studies 
        department and eventually pushed the university to create an Equal 
        Opportunity Program and support students of color through an Office of 
        Minority Affairs.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Soon after being 
        contacted by Flavors, Carl Miller spoke with Dr. Eugene Elliott, an 
        assistant to University of Washington president Charles Odegaard, and asked 
        him to arrange a meeting with Ralph for the following morning. The plan was 
        for Miller and BSU co-founders Aaron Dixon and Larry Gossett to convince 
        Ralph to reinstate the two Franklin students. This would be the UW BSU&rsquo;s 
        first high profile action.&nbsp; To the three men, it was imperative to fight the 
        issue as a matter of principle and because, as Miller put it, &ldquo;The Black 
        Student Union encourages black brothers and sisters to stay in school.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref5" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn5"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[5]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The BSU's attempt to 
        resolve the issue through negotiations proved unsuccessful, and this setback 
        became the catalyst for the demonstration at Franklin later that day. 
        Angered that Ralph was un-receptive to the peaceful negotiations of the BSU 
        students, African American Franklin students wanted to &ldquo;burn the school 
        down,&rdquo; but Aaron Dixon convinced the group of students &ldquo;that if there was no 
        Franklin none of them could further their education.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref6" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[6]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        As reported in the <i>Seattle Post Intelligencer</i>, Dixon, Gossett, and 
        Miller instructed the students to gather at a local eatery called &ldquo;The 
        Beanery&rdquo; across the street from the school, to alleviate a potentially 
        violent situation.<a name="_ednref7" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[7]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        There, the three UW students formulated a plan of action that would 
        peacefully yet effectively get their point across: racial discrimination 
        would no longer be tolerated within the Seattle Public school system.&nbsp; 
        According to Dixon, &ldquo;Carl Miller and I &hellip; brought the students out (of the 
        Beanery) and formed them in twos. We felt if we were going to do any 
        demonstrating, it should be done in a peaceful and orderly manner.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref8" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[8]</span></span></a> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At 12:45 p.m. 100 
        students, including roughly 40 non-Franklin students, marched into Principal 
        Ralph&rsquo;s office, chanting &ldquo;Ungowa, BLACK POWER!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; They demanded, first and 
        foremost, that Ralph immediately reinstate Trolice Flavors and Charles 
        Oliver.&nbsp; Alongside this, the student's made three other demands: 1) that a 
        black administrator be hired at the high school level in the Seattle Public 
        School system; 2) that an African American history class be taught at 
        Franklin; and 3) that images of black heroes grace the school walls along 
        with the other American historical figures already featured. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;It 
        was the first time a sit-it had been held at a high school in the Seattle 
        area, and Ralph as well as other school officials did not know how to react. 
        When it became obvious to Ralph that the demonstrators were not going to 
        leave until their demands were met, he dismissed all Franklin students and 
        faculty to ensure their &quot;safety.&quot;<a name="_ednref9" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn9"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[9]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        There was no violence imposed on Ralph or anyone else<span style="color:red">. </span><span style="color:black">While 2,000 people left Franklin at 1:45 
          p.m. the demonstrators remained firm, and did not leave school grounds until 
          3:45 pm. With so many students trying to get their point across, things did 
          become somewhat unruly. But as Carl Miller later assured reporters, the BSU 
          was not there to inflame the situation but rather as a focused means of 
          guidance. &ldquo;We went there to keep things down,&rdquo; he said.<a name="_ednref10" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn10"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline">[10]</span></span></a></span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Seattle 
        police closed off the school building from the public and patrolled the 
        grounds so that demonstrators inside the building would not be able to 
        leave.&nbsp; Mediators from several local minority empowerment groups, including 
        the Central Area Motivating Program (CAMP), the state Multiservice Center, 
        and Seattle schools&rsquo; Intergroup Relations Office were called in to urge the 
        students from Franklin and the University of Washington to leave the 
        administration offices and take their cause to the auditorium &ndash; a larger 
        location better suited to fit all 100 students. After some hesitation, the 
        demonstrators agreed, but insisted that they would not completely exit 
        Franklin grounds until Ralph met their demands.&nbsp; Instead, school officials, 
        mediators, and students arranged a meeting for the following Monday to 
        discuss the demands and the issue of racial discrimination in the Seattle 
        Public School system.&nbsp; This compromise allowed the demonstration to end 
        peacefully. The only damage was in Principal Ralph&rsquo;s office restroom, where 
        the sink had been disconnected from the wall due to the excessive in and out 
        flow of students during the demonstration.<a name="_ednref11" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn11"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[11]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A five hour hearing was held the following Monday at the Seattle 
        Human Rights Commission office. At the hearing, Seattle Public Schools 
        Superintendent Dr. Forbes Bottomly announced that one of the two suspended 
        students would be reinstated. However, he also insinuated that the King 
        County prosecutor&rsquo;s office would be asked to press charges against UW BSU 
        leaders for their role in the protest. Bottomly claimed: &ldquo;we want to be sure 
        that the loitering ordinance is upheld and that the schools are protected 
        from outsiders coming in and disrupting our schools.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref12" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn12"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[12]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><b> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">THE ARRESTS</span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Carl 
        Miller, Aaron Dixon, Larry and Richard Gossett, and Trolice Flavors were 
        arrested for their participation in the Franklin High School sit-in at 
        approximately 8:30 a.m. on April 4th, 1968; later that same day, the 
        Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. The students were 
        charged with unlawful assembly. Although the five men had been involved in 
        various forms of community activism and protest in the past, this was the 
        first time any of them had been arrested and taken to jail. They knew that 
        the sit-in had gained a lot of exposure because it was headline news in many 
        Seattle publications; however, they did not believe what they had done 
        warranted arrest. They had assembled for a just cause and adjourned the 
        premises of Franklin peacefully and non-violently. As such, they viewed the 
        decision to press charges as clearly a politically motivated act. Never to 
        be discouraged, the five men were confident that justice would ultimately 
        prevail. Although the BSU students were not regretful about their 
        participation in the sit-in, it appeared that the general non-black 
        population felt differently. A quote from Principal Loren Ralph best 
        exemplifies the prevailing sentiment: &ldquo;Can a mob or group of protestors go 
        into any public establishment and force their will on administration whether 
        the administration is right or wrong?&rdquo;<a name="_ednref13" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn13"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[13]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        The students didn&rsquo;t have mainstream support, but they did have the support 
        of many in the Seattle community.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The BSU 
        leaders were taken to King County jail, which, ironically, is now the newly 
        remodeled office of present day county councilman Larry Gossett. For all of 
        the insinuations about the BSU students being troublemakers, jail officials 
        labeled Miller, Gossett, and Dixon &ldquo;peacemakers&rdquo; during their time in 
        prison. As stated earlier, the five young men were arrested the morning of 
        Dr. Martin Luther King&rsquo;s assassination. <span class="essaybody">Citizens 
          across the nation were deeply saddened by King&rsquo;s death; a leader was lost 
          but there was also the sense that the non-violent approach to civil rights 
          was being replaced by intense angst and disillusionment and a call for 
          immediate action by youthful revolutionaries. Riots broke out in cities such 
          as Washington D.C., Chicago, IL, and Baltimore, MD.&nbsp; Crowds of people were 
          angry and felt betrayed by the lack of progress in racial equality. </span> The jail in Seattle was also in an uproar following the disheartening news 
        of Dr. King&rsquo;s death, and there was talk of a riot. Gossett recalled that </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">About six 
        or seven hours after we got in jail, news came that Martin Luther King, Jr. 
        had been assassinated. And the black prisoners, their conception of black 
        power was that they were going to go beat up these white prisoners.<a name="_ednref14" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn14"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[14]</span></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Dixon, 
        Gossett, and Miller counseled against any violence, persuading the inmates 
        that taking out their anger in a violent fashion would not honor Dr. King&rsquo;s 
        legacy. The BSU leaders decided to gather all inmates and encourage them to 
        talk about their personal problems and current world affairs.&nbsp; Prison 
        officials did not know how to react. They expected violence, especially from 
        African American men. Three young college educated black men were helping to 
        assist a peaceful congregation of inmates, encouraging them to verbally, and 
        non-violently, express their feelings as a means for solving problems. 
        Nevertheless, jail officials saw the meetings as threatening. According to 
        Gossett, &ldquo;Word got out later that night we were having discussions

      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
        initial hearing for four of the five defendants in the Franklin High sit-in 
        case was held April 5th, 1968. Since Richard Gossett had voluntarily 
        surrendered to the police, he was not included in the arraignment hearing. 
        The others were escorted into the courtroom in chains. Gossett remembers:</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">We were in 
        there for a misdemeanor, but they had, I think it was, the three of us 
        handcuffed around here [wrists], around our waist, around our ankles. It was 
        very symbolic of slavery. They had the guards holding the chains, about four 
        feet in back of us, as they brought the three of us in court, you know, like 
        we were the coldest murderers that ever hit Seattle, not some people that 
        had been busted for a misdemeanor unlawful assembly charge, but that&rsquo;s how 
        they saw it.<a name="_ednref16" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn16"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[16]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">It was 
        just a preliminary hearing, not a trial, but the public support for the 
        defendants was astonishing. According to accounts in the <i>Seattle P.I.</i> several hundred people showed up for Gossett, Flavors, Miller, and Dixon.<a name="_ednref17" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn17"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[17]</span></span></a> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The 
        purpose of the hearing was to see if Judge James J. Dore would uphold the 
        original ruling of Justice Court Judge Evans D. Mapolides, to hold the four 
        defendants in jail on $1,500 bail until their trial. A nervous feeling hung 
        over the courtroom as anxious family members, classmates, and community 
        supporters awaited Judge Dore's decision. Chief Criminal Deputy Prosecutor 
        William L. Kinzel and assistant Prosecutor Neal L. Shulman argued that the 
        bail was appropriate. Dore ultimately decided after a persuasive testimony 
        from an array of friends, relatives, UW faculty, and the four individuals 
        themselves, that the students were respectable in character and would indeed 
        show up for the trial that would determine sentencing. He stated, &ldquo;The 
        purpose of bail was to retain people for hearing, not to keep them without 
        cause.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref18" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn18"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[18]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        As Judge Dore announced to the courtroom that he would allow Miller, 
        Gossett, Flavors, and Dixon to remain out of jail on personal recognizance, 
        the group of 400 people that sat in the courtroom cheered. The issue was not 
        yet resolved, but it was a small victory for the civil rights activists.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b> <span class="head14" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">THE TRIAL</span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">On June 
        6th, 1968, just five days before the scheduled trial by jury for the 
        Franklin sit-in participants, the defense team presented a motion asking the 
        court to drop the charges. They argued that the charges were 
        unconstitutional because the crowd had the constitutional right of assembly. 
        The defense also challenged the process by which jurors were selected for 
        trials. Specifically, the defense argued that they were unable to question 
        prospective jurors at the Justice Court level. According to procedure, each 
        side is allowed to have six jurors dismissed and the six remaining out of 
        the initial eighteen would become the jury. In Superior Court, attorneys can 
        question the jurors and can dismiss an unlimited number if cause can be 
        shown.<a name="_ednref19" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn19"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[19]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        Aaron Dixon, who at this point had been appointed as Captain of the Black 
        Panther Party, Seattle chapter, had this to say in regards to jury 
        selection:&nbsp; &ldquo;The Black Panther Party believes Negroes should be tried by all 
        Negro juries because a peer group is someone from the same racial and 
        historical background as you.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref20" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn20"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[20]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        Ultimately the trial continued as scheduled because Judge Dore did not have 
        the authority to change the law that the legislature had created regarding 
        jury selection. In addition, Carl Miller and Aaron Dixon instructed their 
        American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Michael Rosen to drop the 
        issue and proceed as scheduled. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&nbsp;On June 
        13th, 1968, the trial of Aaron Dixon, Larry Gossett, and Carl Miller began. 
        A request for charges to be dropped against Trolice Flavors was granted. As 
        for Richard Gossett, because he never physically entered the school 
        building, he was not held accountable for the same crime as the other three 
        men and the charges were dropped.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the defense team feared, the &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; selected jury 
        consisted of six &quot;peers,&quot; three men and three women, all of whom were white. 
        The trial lasted a total of four days. Michael Rosen and other fellow 
        defense attorneys tried to have the case dismissed on several grounds. Rosen 
        argued that there was insufficient evidence against the defendants and 
        charged that the case was motivated by racial prejudice. A total of 14 
        witnesses were called to testify in behalf of the defendants including Dr. 
        Eugene Elliott, assistant University of Washington president, who had been 
        involved in efforts to recruit more minorities to the university. Charles 
        Odegaard also took the stand and described his efforts to arrange a meeting 
        with Principal Ralph. He vouched for the good character of all three men, 
        and affirmed his support of their efforts.<a name="_ednref21" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn21"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[21]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        Throughout the trial, Gossett, Dixon and Miller received tremendous 
        community support. Dedicated supporters showed up each day of the trial, 
        holding signs that expressed both encouragement and outrage. Signs read: 
        &ldquo;Call off your Pigs;&rdquo; &ldquo;Black Control of the Black Community;&rdquo; &ldquo;Free Aaron 
        Dixon;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Support the Panthers, not the Pigs.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref22" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn22"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[22]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        As indicated by the latter two messages, public support and media coverage 
        had shifted from focusing on the three students to Dixon&rsquo;s now very 
        prominent participation and leadership of the Black Panther Party, circa May 
        of 1968. Photographs by Fred Londier reveal how racially mixed the crowd was 
        that gathered daily in support of the defendants. His photos also capture 
        the calm demeanor of Miller, Dixon, and Gossett during the trial. They 
        remained confident that no matter how the trial turned out, they had made 
        their mark in Seattle.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">&nbsp;The 
        prosecution was relentless in portraying the UW students as violent 
        criminals. Principal Loren Ralph insisted that he was manhandled, and 
        prosecuting attorney Shulman stated, &ldquo;It was not these defendants who 
        maintained order - it was Mr. Ralph and the school administration. They kept 
        their cool.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref23" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn23"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[23]</span></span></a> </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">The jury 
        reached a verdict on June 13th after a one-hour deliberation. Carl Miller, 
        Larry Gossett, and Aaron Dixon were found guilty on gross misdemeanor 
        charges of unlawful assembly. The verdict was decided, but sentencing for 
        the three men was delayed until July 1st, 1968. For his part, Judge Dore was 
        in complete agreement with the jurors, stating that he felt the sit-in had 
        been unlawful because of the disruption of classes at Franklin and the chaos 
        that ensued as a result.<a name="_ednref24" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn24"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[24]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center"><b> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">SENTENCING</span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">On July 
        1st, 1968, Judge Dore sentenced Gossett, Dixon, and Miller to 6 months in 
        prison, posting bail at $500. Immediate outrage erupted in the Seattle area, 
        particularly in the predominately African American neighborhood known as the 
        Central District. The anger from racial tension only heightened once the 
        three students were sentenced to jail, resulting in riots in some Seattle 
        areas. Damage to businesses and physical assaults increased as a result of 
        the community&rsquo;s frustration. Defense attorney Gary P. Gayton stated in the <i>Seattle Times</i>, &ldquo;There is no question about this (the riot). This is 
        what caused it.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref25" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn25"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[25]</span></span></a></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">At the 
        same time that the sentencing was being announced, the Black Panther Party 
        held a press conference to voice its displeasure with the sentencing. 
        According to reports in the <i>Seattle P.I., </i>the Panthers said, &ldquo;We 
        intend to get to the source of the problem and that&rsquo;s downtown - in 
        Prosecutor Charles O. Carroll&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref26" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn26"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[26]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        Meanwhile, supporters raised money for bail. The morning after sentencing, a 
        total of $1,500 was collected to free the students from jail. Contributors 
        included the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party, Ecumenical 
        Metropolitan Ministry, a group of UW law professors, the Revs. D. Harvey, 
        McIntyre, and Joseph A.

      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">One of the 
        most notable developments arising from the Franklin sit-in was the 
        establishment, in Seattle, of the nation's first chapter of the Black 
        Panther Party outside of California. <span class="essaybody">The Black 
          Panther Party (BPP) was founded in Oakland, CA. in 1966 by Huey P. Newton 
          and Bobby Seale. By 1968, it had already received large amounts of press 
          coverage for its militant advocacy of armed self defense to ward off 
          &lsquo;oppressors&rsquo; of any kind. The BPP argued that the mainstream civil rights 
          movement, which stressed nonviolence and formal legal equality, had failed 
          to eradicate injustice, and thus new, more radical forms of protest were 
          necessary. They demanded community control, economic rights, and access to 
          quality education. The days of conforming were over. The mood was restless, 
          and the message that a new day had arrived was clear. As the BPP's 
          membership grew it helped change the direction of civil rights activism. As 
          it did so, conflicts with police increased. </span>In subsequent years <span class="essaybody">tensions grew even higher as members of the Black 
            Panther Party were slain by police officers in what were perceived by many 
            in the civil rights movement as senseless acts of violence.</span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="essaybody"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Upon 
        release from jail after the April 5th hearing, Aaron Dixon, Larry Gossett, 
        and Carl Miller, along with other University of Washington BSU members, 
        attended a Black Student Union national conference at San Francisco State 
        University. While in California, they also attended the funeral of Little 
        Bobby Hutton, who was the first Black Panther member to be killed by police. 
        The day after Hutton&rsquo;s funeral, Bobby Seale spoke at the BSU conference. 
        Though still dealing with the loss of his friend, Seale gave a compelling 
        speech about the Black Power movement. His words touched all of the BSU 
        members but had a major impact on Aaron Dixon. Dixon recalls, &ldquo;It was one of 
        the most inspiring speeches I have heard, even up until this point.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref28" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn28"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[28]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        Larry Gossett remembers, &ldquo;We were so immensely impressed with the 
        discipline, and the solidarity, and the youthfulness of the Black Panther 
        Party.&rdquo;<a name="_ednref29" title style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="#_edn29"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial;   vertical-align: baseline">[29]</span></span></a>&nbsp; 
        The Seattle BSU members were so enthralled with the Panthers that they 
        approached Seale and invited him to come speak on their campus. He agreed, 
        arriving a month later, and was hosted by Aaron Dixon&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Seale 
        determined that Seattle was ready for a Black Panther chapter. It seemed 
        logical to appoint Aaron as the captain of the Seattle Panther chapter, as 
        Seale was impressed by his energy and ideas. Although Dixon was reluctant, 
        he accepted the role and, as a result, became a focal point of the media, 
        especially during the Franklin trial. </span></p>

        14th, 1971 the case of the three men was appealed before the Washington

        1960s was a tumultuous period in American history. The Vietnam War raged on, 
        consuming the lives of thousands and setting off uprisings in dozens of 
        American cities. The My Lai massacre in South Vietnam, which took place on 
        March 16th 1968, sparked a great deal of controversy when it came to light 
        and greatly reduced public support for the war. Yet as </span></span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">Edward P. 
          Morgan stated in the <i>Seattle P.I.</i>, &ldquo;The greatest issue facing the

          Morgan&rsquo;s quote effectively demonstrates the urgency to change race relations 
          in the United States during the Civil Rights era. The Franklin sit-in and 
          the creation of the Seattle Black Panther Party reflect this sense of 
          urgency. <span class="essaybody"></span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="essaybody"> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The sit-in at Franklin High was more than a mere attempt to 
        get two students reinstated in school. It evolved into a critical fight for 
        justice and equal opportunity in the Seattle area.</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black"> The Franklin sit-in was the first demonstration for the UW BSU and inspired 
          many other movements in the Seattle area and throughout the region. After 
          the media publicity of the first hearing, hundreds of black students around 
          Seattle wanted to join forces with the Black Student Union at the University 
          of Washington. The BSU is still thriving at the UW today. <span class="essaybody">&nbsp;All of the BSU students contributed to the Civil 
            Rights Movement in their own way. Against the odds, they persevered and 
            remained non-violent, a tactic that many would argue proved successful. 
            Among the positive changes that can be attributed, either directly or 
            indirectly through the growth of the UW BSU, to the Franklin sit-in, was the 
            desegregation of several schools, new employment opportunities for minority 
            faculty, and new programs that sought to further the education of African 
            Americans beyond high school.</span></span></p>

        back, all three BSU founders said they wouldn&rsquo;t have done anything 
        differently. They endured a lot but accomplished so much more. As Larry 
        Gossett proclaimed in an interview years later, nothing rattled Seattle like
