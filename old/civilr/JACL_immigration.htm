              <p class="WordSection1" style="text-indent:.5in;page-break-before:always">During the first half of the twentieth century, the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) played an important role in the struggle for civil liberties, immigration reform and social equality in  the Puget Sound region and the nation at large. From its founding, the organization endeavored to stand up for the politcal and legal rights of the first generation <i>Issei</i>, legally barred from citizenship, as well as their American-born children, the second generation <i>Nisei</i>. The methods that the JACL employed to pursue these goals, however, especially during World War II, proved divisive, ultimately alienating a significant portion of the Japanese-American community.</p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="text-indent:.5in;page-break-before:always"> This report examines the history of the JACL from its founding through the early Cold War period. Why did the JACL pursue such a divisive course of action during the Second World War? What were the overriding factors that caused the JACL to act in a manner that came close to self-destruction? Why did the JACL undertake actions that, at times, seemed  diametrically opposed to its stated purpose of promoting the interests of the Japanese-American community? What was the reasoning behind these activities, and under what constraints were they made?<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of Democracy in America,</i> author Mary Dudziak argues that the bipolar pressures of the first two decades of the Cold War severely limited the range of permissible civil rights debate in the United States. Legislative progress on civil rights was possible because Americans needed to appeal to  non-white, Cold War allies in the Third World, but public criticism of the nation&rsquo;s civil rights failings had the potential to become Soviet propaganda and  faced severe restriction and censorship.<a style="mso-endnote-id:

              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These pressures  affected the activities of the JACL during the years after World War II. However, it is important to recognize that the organization&rsquo;s options were constrained not just during the Cold War, but also in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack of December 7, 1941. Rampant doubts about the loyalty of Japanese Americans restricted the JACL to an unprecedented degree.  After Pearl Harbor, the white majority questioned the very ability of a person of Japanese ancestry to become an American. Could a Japanese individual truly become an American citizen in their heart, and was such a thing even desirable? During the Cold War, the JACL had to fight to achieve even a token level of legal Japanese immigration, and it was willing to support a flawed, illiberal law in order to reach that goal. What was it about the pressures of the Cold War and the earlier World War II experience that made the JACL willing to make such a bargain? These questions go far beyond the black-white civil rights dichotomy described in Dudziak's book.<o:p></o:p><b><u><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrimination against another group of Asian immigrants, the Chinese, initially influenced Japanese immigration to the United States. After having worked tirelessly to help complete the first transcontinental railroad in 1869, Chinese laborers quickly found themselves on the wrong end of public opinion.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a> American whites did not want to compete with the Chinese for jobs. Agitation by the Caucasian majority eventually resulted in the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited further immigration by Chinese laborers.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a> It was the first U.S. law to limit immigration based on race.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a> The sudden decrease in the number of Chinese workers created an opportunity for the Japanese. During the 1880&rsquo;s, the Meiji government in Japan had placed a heavy tax burden on the agricultural sector in order to help fund its ambitious program of rapid industrialization. The resulting financial strain caused Japanese farmers to consider emigration as a way to escape impoverishment. Rumors of high wages led many to believe that &ldquo;money grew on trees&rdquo; in the United States. This promise of opportunity prompted thousands of Japanese to apply for emigration to the U.S. in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, where even the low-paid jobs ultimately available to them were seen as a step up from their hardscrabble existence in Japan.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a handful of Japanese lived in the United States in the 1880&rsquo;s, but more regular immigration began in the 1890&rsquo;s, primarily to the West Coast. In 1890, there were 2,036 Japanese in all of the United States, but, by 1910, that number had jumped to 72,157. The Japanese population would maintain a modest, but steady, growth in the following years. These early Japanese immigrants were primarily manual laborers and seasonal agricultural workers. As David Takami notes in his book <i>Divided Destiny</i> &ldquo;As the white mainstream felt the growing economic competition, their resentment and prejudice grew.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a>&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the San Francisco school board attempted to make local Japanese children attend a segregated school in Chinatown in late 1906, it created a diplomatic crisis for the United States government. The Japanese government demanded redress for this insult. Since Japan had recently delivered a stunning defeat to the Russians in the Battle of the Japan Sea in 1905, the United States saw the nation as a rising power with whom they wished to maintain good relations.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a> President Theodore Roosevelt personally negotiated a resolution on the school board issue with the Japanese government. These negotiations resulted in the so-called Gentlemen's Agreement of 1908. In return for allowing the Japanese in America to continue attending non-segregated public schools, the Japanese government agreed to no longer issue passports to Japanese laborers who had never visited the U.S., slowing immigration to a trickle.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn8" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tensions between Japanese immigrants and the Caucasian population increased over time, eventually coming to a head in 1920. Looking at the situation in the Seattle area gives a general idea of the larger issues at stake. Farming by Japanese in Washington reached a peak in 1920. Over a thousand Japanese were farming more than 25,000 acres of land, twice the acreage that they had cultivated in 1910.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn9" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a> By this time, the Japanese supplied half of Seattle's milk and produced 75% of the region's vegetables.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a> A loophole in the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1908 allowed Japanese men to import women from Japan whom they had married by proxy, so the Japanese population in the Seattle area had continued to increase. By 1920, 7,874 ethnic Japanese had been born locally, accounting for a quarter of Seattle's Japanese population.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a> This increase, along with the dominance in agriculture, provoked a reaction in Washington State and other areas with similar development, such as California.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agitation by the white population prompted Congress to hold hearings during the summer of 1920 before the Congressional Committee on Immigration and Naturalization in Seattle and Tacoma and other areas of the western U.S.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a> Testimony by anti-Japanese forces before the Committee, and other sources of anti-Japanese agitation, prompted Congress to initiate legislative action. This pressure eventually resulted in the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which introduced racial quotas to U.S. immigration policy. Other Asian races, such as the Chinese, were given an immigration quota but the Japanese were not. A quota for the Japanese was originally to have been included but Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (R-MA) derailed this at the last moment. Virtually all Japanese immigration to the U.S. was now completely cut off.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a><b><u><o:p></o:p></u></b><b><u><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of the JACL begins with the Seattle chapter as the branch was of great importance at both a local and a national level. Henry H. Okuda and Chusaburo Ito founded the predecessor of the JACL, the Seattle Progressive Citizens League (SPCL), in 1921. Created as a vehicle to fight legalized discrimination against aliens, it was largely ineffective for two main reasons. First, the SPCL only accepted first generation <i>Issei</i> immigrants as members, completely barring their <i>Nisei</i> offspring, a small but growing section of the local Japanese population. Second, the SPCL's leadership was fairly inactive. The SPCL held only three official meetings between 1921 and 1928.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man by the name of James Sakamoto would take soon action to remedy this situation. Sakamoto was a <i>Nisei</i> born in Seattle in 1903. A boxer, he began to lose his sight in his mid-twenties due to sports-related injuries. Sakamoto realized that Seattle's <i>Nisei</i> community was divided and politically apathetic partly because the SPCL had completely ignored them. On January 1, 1928, he founded a weekly newspaper called the <i>Japanese American Courier</i>. In his new publication, Sakamoto wrote articles calling upon the <i>Nisei</i> to register to vote. He also praised the SPCL for its worthwhile goals, but criticized the organization for its failure to act more effectively. Sakamoto's insights would quickly yield results.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the editorials,<a name="_GoBack"></a> the SPCL reorganized. In 1930, it became the Seattle chapter of the JACL, the first of its kind in the country. Unlike the SPCL, the JACL accepted <i>Nisei</i> members. Some <i>Issei</i> resisted these changes, but most were in favor of them. New leadership was brought in, with James Sakamoto himself becoming president of the Seattle JACL in 1931. The new JACL sought out other Japanese-American organizations throughout the country and soon formed the national JACL.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn16" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a> The very first national JACL convention was held in Seattle in 1930.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn17" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the national JACL advocated for a wide variety of legal reforms to benefit the Japanese-American community, it was especially active in its efforts to liberalize immigration and naturalization laws during the 1930s. One of their main goals was to gain naturalized citizenship for <i>Issei</i> who had fought for the United States during World War I. A 1934 memo from the San Francisco JACL office noted that they should: <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p>

              <p class="WordSection1">The JACL hoped that gaining naturalization for WW I veterans would soon lead to other immigration gains. This goal would be frustrated for years to come.<o:p></o:p><b><u><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>
              <p class="WordSection1"><b><u>In The Wake Of Pearl Harbor<o:p></o:p></u></b><b><u><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the nation of Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, it shocked and dismayed the Japanese-American community. A passage from Bill Hosokawa's <i>Nisei: The Quiet Americans</i> captures this feeling quite well:<o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:25.0pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:31.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&ldquo;The horror, the anger, the shock that reverberated throughout the United States in the wake of the news flash that Pearl Harbor was under attack was, for the <i>Issei</i> and <i>Nisei</i>, magnified many fold by reason of their ethnic and cultural ties with the nation that had shattered the peace. Added to these emotions was the searing sense of shame and grief, and yes, fear. The <i>Nisei</i> knew they were Americans, but would their white neighbors agree? The <i>Issei</i> suddenly had become enemy aliens, a role they accepted unwillingly for they had no recourse.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:25.0pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:31.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">The attack would ultimately set in motion a course of events that even the most pessimistic of the <i>Issei</i> and <i>Nisei</i> would fail to foresee entirely.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that time was critical, the leadership of the JACL leapt into action. Saburo Kido, the national JACL president, quickly released a statement unequivocally condemning the Pearl Harbor attack, while also declaring the loyalty of the Japanese-American community to the United States in the strongest language possible. He also sent an eloquent telegram to President Roosevelt pledging the JACL's unstinting support for the now inevitable war effort:<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:25.65pt;margin-bottom:

              <p class="WordSection1">In the first few weeks after the attack, Kido's efforts seemed to be enough to quell suspicion of Japanese Americans, but this turned out to be just the calm before the storm.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewed through the prism of fear and paranoia created in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack, the vast majority of white America came to perceive their Japanese-American neighbors with unrelenting distrust. The already hostile environment in which most Japanese Americans had lived prior to the attack became still more precarious. The community&rsquo;s ability to defend itself publicly grew increasingly circumscribed. Even when the efforts proved moderately successful, the outcome was seen as another sign of Japanese perfidy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within this toxic milieu, the JACL made a number of very difficult decisions, some of which would damage their standing within the Japanese-American community at large. After Pearl Harbor, any attempts by the JACL to pursue liberalization of immigration and naturalization laws were destined for failure. This avenue would not be open to them again until the years following the Pacific War.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 4, 1942, Damon Runyon, a widely read columnist who belonged to the William Randolph Hearst publishing empire, released a column designed to stir up anti-Japanese sentiment. In it, Runyon stated: &ldquo;It would be extremely foolish to doubt the continued existence of enemy agents among the large alien Japanese population.&rdquo; Other columnists and news commentators soon echoed Runyon's unfounded assertion.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn21" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a> On the same day of Runyon's column, General John Dewitt, the man in charge of the Western Defense Command, publicly stated of the <i>Nisei</i>: &ldquo;I have no confidence in their loyalty whatsoever.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a> These statements, and others like them that soon followed, helped to reignite a latent anti-Asian sentiment that had lain mostly dormant since the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Japanese Americans had enlisted in the U.S. military immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack in order to protect their country. In the paranoid aftermath of the Runyon column, the Selective Service System reclassified <i>Nisei</i> as category 4C &ndash; aliens ineligible for service. <i>Nisei,</i> who had already enlisted, were soon mustered out, with only a handful of exceptions.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn23" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a> This denial of military service eliminated one of the ways that Japanese Americans could prove their loyalty. It was the first of many attacks on the mere concept of <i>Nisei</i> citizenship. The <i>Nisei</i> soon found themselves being referred to by the baffling title of &ldquo;resident non-aliens&rdquo;.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn24" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 12, 1942, the popular liberal columnist Walter Lippman released an article calling for the &ldquo;mass evacuation&rdquo; of Japanese from the western coast of the United States.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn25" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a> In only a matter of weeks, without having committed a single act of disloyalty or sabotage, Japanese Americans became a suspect alien presence that the white majority wanted excised. Instead of being seen largely as an economic threat, they were now perceived as disloyal saboteurs simply waiting for&nbsp; right opportunity to strike a blow on behalf of Imperial Japan.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which allowed military commanders to specify areas of the country from which &ldquo;any or all persons may be excluded.&rdquo; Although EO 9066 did not explicitly name the Japanese as its target, its application focused almost exclusively on them.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn26" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a> As <i>Issei</i> and <i>Nisei</i> prepared themselves for possible evacuation, the leadership of the JACL continued to be in denial. Surely such a thing could not happen in the United States, the land of freedom?<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congressman John H. Tolan decided to hold hearings on the &ldquo;evacuation issue&rdquo; in San Francisco on February 21, only two days after the signing of Executive Order 9066. Somewhat naively, the JACL believed that by providing testimony it might be able to modify, or perhaps even overturn, EO 9066. In truth, the hearings were merely a public spectacle that would have no influence on government policy.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn27" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highlight of the hearings was the testimony of Mike Masaoka, the National Secretary for the JACL. His prepared statement to the committee on behalf of the national JACL asserted that EO 9066 appeared to unjustly target Japanese Americans. The most important passage from his testimony follows:<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:25.0pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:31.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&ldquo;...If, in the judgment of military and federal authorities, evacuation of the Japanese residents from the West Coast is a primary step toward assuring the safety of this nation, we will have no hesitation in complying with the necessities implicit in that judgment. But if, on the other hand, such evacuation is primarily a measure whose surface urgently cloaks the desires of political or other pressure groups who want us to leave merely from motives of self-interest, we feel that we have every right to protest and demand equitable judgment on our merits as American citizens...&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">Masaoka's statement made no impact on the Tolan Committee or on the enforcement of EO 9066. However, this statement would later be seen by many of the JACL's Japanese-American critics as a precursor to the League's decision to urge compliance with internment policy. This perception would cause problems for the organization, and Masaoka himself, after the war.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn29" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a> <o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inability to influence policy outcomes through participation in the Tolan Committee was an important lesson for the leadership of the JACL. It showed them the contours of a new political reality, shaped by fear and anti-Japanese paranoia, where their ability to affect change through the official organs of government hardly existed. It would be the first of many such lessons that would soon cause JACL president Kido to conclude that:<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.25pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:30.65pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&ldquo;Never in the thousands of years of human history has a group of citizens been branded on so wholesale a scale as to be treacherous to their own native land...We [the JACL leadership] question the motives and patriotism of such men and leaders who intentionally fan racial animosity and hatred.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn30" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-right:26.25pt">Kido had realized that in post-Pearl Harbor America the Japanese would be judged as a collective whole rather than as individuals. In this situation, the JACL would reluctantly accept a position of leadership for the Japanese-American community &ldquo;by default.&rdquo; Kido felt there was simply nobody else capable of doing so at that time.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn31" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 2, 1942, General DeWitt released Public Proclamation No. 1, which stated that &ldquo;all persons of Japanese ancestry&rdquo; would be removed from the western coast of the continental United States.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn32" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a> The moment of crisis, which the JACL had been dreading, had now arrived. The group&rsquo;s leadership had to decide whether to resist or cooperate with the evacuation order. Given the rabid anti-Japanese sentiment present in the country and the lack of other ways to prove their loyalty, the JACL leadership felt that it not only had to comply, but it also had to do everything possible to ensure that the evacuation itself went smoothly. Kido and Masaoka read between the lines of Public Proclamation No. 1 and saw the implied threat of violence if Japanese did not willingly cooperate.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn33" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a> Their attempts to affect policy through official channels had failed. JACL National Secretary Mike Masaoka knew that this would be a controversial decision and later tried to justify it:<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:25.65pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:30.65pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&ldquo;We were led to believe that if we cooperated with the Army in this mass movement, the government would try to be as helpful and as humane as possible with the evacuees. Moreover, we feared the consequences if Japanese Americans refused to cooperate...at a time when Japan was still on the offensive and apparently winning the war, we were afraid that the American people would consider us traitors and enemies of the war effort if we forced the Army to take drastic action against us...&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn34" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">This decision, more than any other action taken by the JACL during the war, had lasting repercussions for the organization. After the war, many Japanese Americans would harbor great bitterness towards the JACL for failing to denounce the relocation camps and EO 9066. It would also drive the JACL's post-war immigration reform efforts, which served as a mechanism to rehabilitate the organization&rsquo;s image.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="text-indent:.5in">In hindsight, it is difficult to see what other choice the JACL had in such a hostile environment. The government had willfully decided to&nbsp; ignore the constitutional rights of an entire ethnic group and both the public and many within the progressive community, including the&nbsp; American Civil Liberties Union, refused to offer assistance.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn35" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[35]</a> The environment of mistrust and hatred that existed in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack limited the JACL's options in a way unimaginable only a few months earlier.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After making the decision to cooperate with the evacuation order, the leadership of the JACL decided to dedicate their organization to the following goals:<o:p></o:p></p>
              <ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
                  <li class="WordSection1" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">To assist Japanese Americans in every way possible, help to maintain morale and ease the impact of the evacuation.<o:p></o:p></li>
                  <li class="WordSection1" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">To cooperate and keep in touch with the federal government to ensure just and humane treatment.<o:p></o:p></li>
                  <li class="WordSection1" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">To carry on a public relations program to demonstrate that Japanese Americans were good citizens.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn36" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[36]</a><o:p></o:p></li>
              </ol>
              <p class="WordSection1">The consequences of goal #1 have already been alluded to, and will be discussed further in the post-war section of this report. However, goal #2 turned out to have important unexpected consequences as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to ensure &ldquo;just and humane treatment&rdquo; of the relocation camp occupants, Mike Masaoka painstakingly developed friendly working relationships with first Milton Eisenhower and later Dillon S. Myer, both directors of the War Relocation Authority (WRA), the civilian organization most directly responsible for administering the relocation camps. <a style="mso-endnote-id:edn37" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a> Though initially hesitant, the two men eventually warmed to Masaoka and established a cordial rapport with him. Through Eisenhower and Myer, Masaoka exercised some amount of influence over camp policy. One of his most important successes was convincing Myer to arrange for the release of interned <i>Nisei</i> who had never visited Japan, provided they were able to find paid work outside of the evacuated areas on the West Coast. Masaoka also prevailed upon Myer to visit some of the internment camps personally. What Myer saw in the camps sickened him, spurring him to work towards freeing as many people from the camps as he could, as quickly as possible.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn38" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38]</a> This was an example of the JACL's wartime mandate of &ldquo;constructive cooperation&rdquo; with the government in action.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn39" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[39]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Masaoka was also able to cultivate a positive working relationship with the Assistant Secretary of War John McCloy.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn40" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="">[40]</a> This was ironic given McCloy's personal attitude toward EO 9066: &ldquo;If it is a question of safety of the country or the Constitution of the United States, why the Constitution is just a scrap of paper to me.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn41" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[41]</a> Repeated interaction with Masaoka, including a trip to a Japanese restaurant in San Francisco, eventually convinced McCloy of <i>Nisei</i> loyalty. This change of heart helped prompt the decision to allow <i>Nisei</i> to serve in the U.S. military, a significant policy reversal. The knowledge that the Japanese would serve in segregated units tempered Masaoka's satisfaction over the policy change, but it was still an important victory for the JACL and Japanese Americans in general.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn42" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="">[42]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This &ldquo;constructive cooperation&rdquo; between the JACL, the WRA, and the War Department was not destined to last long. In 1943, a subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) seized the JACL's files. The subcommittee used Masaoka's correspondence with the WRA to discredit both it and the JACL. The subcommittee claimed that Masaoka and the JACL &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; the War Relocation Authority, a preposterous claim given the number of Japanese Americans still residing in the internment camps against their will.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn43" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43]</a> In order to proclaim loyalty to the United States government, the JACL made the difficult decision to cooperate fully with the Evacuation order while simultaneously working within the system to ameliorate camp conditions. Now the HUAC subcommittee vilified the JACL's &ldquo;constructive cooperation&rdquo; efforts as an attempt to subvert U.S. security. It appeared that the JACL was not allowed to attempt to alleviate the plight of their fellow Japanese Americans in any fashion. All avenues of action appeared closed.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In June of 1942, General DeWitt released his Final Report regarding the successful evacuation of all Japanese from Military Area No. 1. The report is significant since it baldly admits that the entire evacuation effort had been predicated solely on the basis of race. Given DeWitt's position of ultimate authority over the execution of the evacuation operation, it is doubtful that the JACL could have affected its execution in any meaningful way.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn44" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[44]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The year 1943 became a turning point for the JACL. After the Soviets joined the ranks of the Allies, the House Un-American Activities Committee could no longer content itself with aggressively persecuting Communists, real or suspected. By mid-year HUAC had rededicated itself to relentlessly hounding the JACL. Files were seized, officials were called to testify, and prominent members were harassed. Many Japanese Americans chose to resign from the JACL to escape the mounting pressure.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn45" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early 1943, the Army reversed its policy on <i>Nisei</i> and started accepting them as recruits. Though some Japanese Americans resented the idea of fighting to maintain a government which had casually stripped them of their constitutional rights, others saw it as a chance to prove their loyalty or to simply escape the relocation camps. The military also drafted many JACL members.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn46" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[46]</a> Mike Masaoka himself chose to volunteer and ended up serving in the all-Japanese 442<sup>nd</sup> Infantry Regiment, which would go on to earn fame in Mediterranean France. Masaoka would serve with distinction and earn several commendations including the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn47" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title="">[47]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple pressures reduced the JACL through attrition and would render it a hollow shell of its former self. Significant numbers of JACL members ended up serving in the U.S. military, either voluntarily or through the draft.<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn48" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="">[48]</a> Critical members of the JACL leadership team would end up in internment camps, including president Kido and founding member James Sakamoto.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn49" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="">[49]</a> Other members voluntarily resigned from the organization, due either to disaffection with its policies or a desire to distance themselves from a preferred target of HUAC. Financial support from the Japanese-American community dried up and a lack of funds would continue to plague early postwar efforts at rebuilding. Though some local chapters managed to cling to life, the JACL as a national organization had negligible influence during the second half of the Pacific War.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn50" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="">[50]</a><o:p></o:p><b><u><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>
              <p class="WordSection1"><b><u>The JACL During The Early Cold War<o:p></o:p></u></b><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once World War II was over, the JACL undertook an aggressive campaign to rehabilitate its image. This effort was neither easy nor immediately successful. The plight of the Seattle JACL chapter was emblematic of the struggle of the entire organization. The Seattle chapter had ceased to exist entirely by the end of the war. A questionnaire form, which the Seattle branch filled out in 1950 at the request of the national JACL, details the rebuilding difficulties. The completed form notes that an attempt to reestablish the Seattle chapter in 1946 failed outright. It mentions a pronounced &ldquo;lack of enthusiasm&rdquo; from the local Japanese-American population due to the actions that the national JACL had taken to support the war effort. A second attempt to restart the Seattle chapter in 1948 was more successful, but barely so. The chapter had only ten members that year. In 1949, that number had jumped to 220. Over time, the Seattle chapter would recover, and eventually eclipse its previous membership, but, at the close of the 1940&rsquo;s, it remained weak and in disarray.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn51" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title="">[51]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the end of the war, the JACL re-dedicated itself to one of its core issues -liberalization of immigration and naturalization laws. This campaign had a dual objective: achieve tangible legislative outcomes and rehabilitate the JACL's tarnished image among many in the Japanese-American community. After returning from military service on the European front, Mike Masaoka moved to Washington, D.C. in order to lobby Congress on behalf of the JACL. Masaoka's lobbying efforts soon bore fruit. He managed to get an amendment added to the Soldier Brides Act of 1947, which allowed American servicemen to bring their Japanese wives and children back with them to the U.S., despite the prohibitions of the Immigration Act of 1924. On the heels of this success, Masaoka was also able to encourage passage of a law granting citizenship to alien veterans of World War I and II &ldquo;regardless of race.&rdquo; This had been an eagerly sought goal of the JACL from its founding and its achievement was a great source of pride for the organization.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn52" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title="">[52]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By 1948, the onset of the Cold War made things more difficult for the JACL. Similar to the drastic shift in the political and social climate in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack, the rules suddenly changed and the JACL had to adjust once again. Progress on immigration reform was still possible in this environment, but any laws passed had to satisfy the two competing Cold War pressures: a desire to win the goodwill of Third-World countries in an effort blunt the appeal of Communism and the need to not allow in any individuals who threatened the United States' newly heightened sense of national security. These two factors would interact in ways that would create unlikely alliances and unanticipated outcomes. As Roger Daniels notes in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Guarding the Golden Door</i>, &ldquo;This paradoxical combination of nativist and liberalizing elements reflected the subordination of immigration policy to foreign policy.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:
edn53" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title="">[53]</a> This was definitely the case in the saga of the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the outset of the Cold War, the JACL had an ambitious legislative agenda. A memo from the Washington, D.C. office dated 7/5/49 listed a multitude of bills that the JACL was lobbying Congress to pass. The memo also noted that various &ldquo;...charges almost like those of the 1920s are being revived to delay consideration of all of our bills. One is that Communism is rampant among Japanese, particularly in Hawaii...Another is that the alien Japanese are not truly assimilated into our American way of life...Still another is that the alien Japanese are really 'pro-Japan'...&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn54" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title="">[54]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="text-indent:.5in">Even early on, the Cold War limited the JACL's room to maneuver. After Pearl Harbor, the very concept of <i>Nisei</i> citizenship faced scrutiny. By the end of WWII, Japanese service in the U.S. military seemed to have addressed this particular concern, an outcome that contributed to Masaoka's quick legislative victories. When Russia suddenly became an enemy of the U.S., red baiting became the weapon of choice to wield against Japanese Americans.<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of the great ironies of history, the beginning of the Korean War in 1950 ended up redounding to the Japanese Americans' favor. Japan itself soon shifted from being an occupied former enemy to a potential Cold War ally. It now behooved the United States to take steps to maintain good relations with Japan to prevent it from falling into the Communist orbit either during or after the American Occupation.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn55" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="">[55]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensing an opportunity, the JACL stepped up its lobbying efforts. In 1950 Congressman Walter Judd, who was on friendly terms with the JACL, introduced a bill that would remove any racial or ethnic restrictions on becoming a naturalized American citizen. The bill passed both chambers of Congress but became so overloaded with dubious security amendments that President Truman quickly vetoed it. The security amendments themselves lived on to become part of the Internal Security Act of 1950, which passed in spite of Truman's veto. This law contained several immigration-related items, including barring Communists from becoming naturalized citizens.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn56" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title="">[56]</a> <o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the failure of the Judd bill as only a temporary setback, Mike Masaoka directly lobbied Congressman Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania to introduce new immigration reform legislation similar to the Judd bill. A separate group of JACL officials lobbied Senator McCarran of Nevada indirectly through his friends. Both legislators introduced bills into their respective chambers of Congress that would form the basis of the eventual McCarran-Walter bill.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn57" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="">[57]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearings on the bill were held in April of 1951. Responses were favorable and both the State and Justice departments indicated their approval. The bill also gained support from some unexpected allies. The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Federation of Labor (AFL), and the National Grange all urged passage of the McCarran-Walter bill. Every single one of these organizations had supported passage of the discriminatory Immigration Act of 1924, which had ended <i>all</i> Japanese immigration to the United States.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn58" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title="">[58]</a> The AFL's change of view was especially astonishing. Organized labor in the U.S. had been relentlessly hostile towards Asian immigration since the Civil War, with the notable exception of a handful of more inclusive unions.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn59" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title="">[59]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final version of the McCarran-Walter Act was passed by Congress in 1952 and it clearly bears the mark of the two Cold War pressures mentioned earlier. The facets of the bill that most directly affected the Japanese are what interest us here. In an effort to win the goodwill of Japan and other nations in the &ldquo;Asian-Pacific Triangle&rdquo; the McCarran-Walter Act repealed the Immigration Act of 1924 and extended a token immigration quota to Asian nations. Japan's quota was a mere one hundred immigrants per year, but the door that had been slammed shut in 1924 was now open a crack. All racial barriers to becoming a naturalized citizen were also removed which was also a victory for the JACL.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn60" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title="">[60]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In compliance with the Cold War desire to keep out any individuals who might threaten national security, the McCarran-Walter Act incorporated many of the features of the National Security Act of 1950 including the explicit prohibition against the admittance of Communists. However, the original language of the 1950 law was amended to create exceptions for individuals who had been forced to join the Communist Party or who had renounced membership of their own accord. This clearly showed that &ldquo;Alien beliefs, not nationalities, were now the focus of concern.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn61" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title="">[61]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The continuance of national origins quotas in the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 contradicted the image that the United States was trying to project to potential Cold War allies, and President Truman knew it. Truman vetoed the bill and issued a scathing statement explaining his action:<o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:26.9pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:31.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&ldquo;The basis of this quota system was false and unworthy in 1924. It is even worse now. At the present time this quota system keeps out the very people we want to bring in. It is incredible to me that, in this year of 1952, we should be enacting into law such a slur on patriotism and the decency of a large part of our citizenry.&rdquo;<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn62" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title="">[62]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">Truman's reasons for issuing a veto were not directly related to the Japanese-American community, but it did directly affect their interests. The twelfth biennial national convention of the JACL was in session in San Francisco when it received news of Truman's veto. Even absent any JACL action, the House of Representatives voted to overturn Truman's veto 278 to 113. What action the Senate might take remained uncertain.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn63" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title="">[63]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The JACL leaped into action, directly lobbying legislators. They wrote editorials supporting the overturn of Truman's veto. <i>Nisei</i> veterans of WW II were enlisted in the effort and talked to their former comrades-in-arms who now held office at the local, state, and national levels. In late June, the Senate voted to overturn Truman's veto by 57 to 26.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn64" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title="">[64]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The McCarran-Walter Act had significant flaws, but its passage into law was a huge victory for the JACL. A legal channel for Japanese immigration was now available for the first time since 1924. For the first time in U.S. history, non-veteran <i>Issei</i> were able to become naturalized citizens. By 1965 46,000 of them had done so.<a style="mso-endnote-id:edn65" href="file:///F:/depress/Eleanor%20projects/The%20Japanese%20American%20Citizens%20League%20em%207.9_web.htm#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title="">[65]</a><o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to overstate the degree to which  the Pearl Harbor attacks and the Cold War affected the JACL's freedom of action. During both periods, the political climate changed almost overnight, creating a new political reality for the JACL and Japanese Americans generally. Although the post-Pearl Harbor era was one of restricted action and repression for the JACL, the Cold War era presented opportunities as well as restrictions. It was not until the Cold War that the JACL was able to accomplish any of its major legislative goals for immigration reform. The desire to win Third-World allies opened doors for the JACL and many foreign nationals. The parallels to civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, as described in Mary Dudziak's <i>Cold War Civil Rights</i>, are striking. <o:p></o:p></p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was mentioned in the introduction of this paper, Dudziak's thesis, concentrated on African-American and white dynamics, does not sufficiently explain the actions taken by the JACL during the 1940&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s. The decision to support compliance with internment policy was <i>the</i> defining action of the JACL during WW II. A string of failed attempts at working within the system to affect change, and the thinly veiled threat of violence that Masaoka and Kido saw in DeWitt's Public Proclamation No. 1, convinced JACL leaders that they had no option other than compliance. The organization's later decision to support the flawed McCarran-Walter Act is partly explained by Dudziak's thesis in the form of prevailing Cold War pressures. However, this decision also shows that JACL leadership had the benefit of hindsight based on the World War II experience. </p>
              <p class="WordSection1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Pearl Harbor, the JACL struggled to figure out the new rules of the game and how to use them to their advantage - if this was even possible. That experience seems to have allowed them to shorten their learning curve in the following decade. Masaoka, in particular, appears to have understood  the nascent Cold War dynamics. He had a realistic idea of what was possible in the new political reality and made a strategic decision to support a flawed bill. The immigration quota was for a token amount, but it was opening the door a crack and would make it easier to shove the door wider when political conditions improved, which is exactly what happened about a decade later. In the meantime, naturalization rights for <i>Issei</i> were worth the trade-off. The bitter experience of WW II had taught difficult lessons and imparted hard won wisdom that was of great use during the Cold War period.<o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p>

Bill Hosokawa makes their decision sound inevitable: &ldquo;<span class="SpellE">Masaoka</span> and Kido knew what the answer had to be. Behind the Army's softly worded request was the threat of force. They had fought the Evacuation as best they could [through the <span class="SpellE">Tolan</span> Committee and other official channels]; further resistance would be suicidal and there was no alternative but to cooperate.&rdquo; <span class="SpellE">Masaoka's</span> fear of the decision being controversial appears to have stemmed from what Japanese Americans who were not privy to all of the information that he was, especially in regard to failed attempts previously made to affect internment policy, would think. Future events would prove this fear to have been well grounded. Whether or not a realistic alternative to full-throated support of internment policy <i>did</i> exist for the JACL leadership at this time is purely speculative, but seems unlikely given the social and political constraints that they then faced. <span class="GramE">(Ibid, 151.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

      <p align="left" class="arial10">Anti-Japanese Legislation - 1889-1924</p>
      <p class="arial10"><u> <span style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Washington State Constitution, 1889</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The prohibition of alien land ownership was included in the original 1889 version of the Washington State constitution.&nbsp; This was not true of the constitutions of other western states with significant alien populations.&nbsp; The primary reason for the alien land article was that the Washington constitution (unlike states that pre-dated Washington) was enacted after the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="arial10">Article II, Section 33 - &nbsp;&ldquo;OWNERSHIP OF LANDS BY ALIENS, PROHIBITED - Exceptions - The ownership of lands by aliens, other than those who in good faith have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, is prohibited in this state, except where acquired by inheritance, under mortgage or in good faith in the ordinary course of justice in the collection of debts; and all conveyances of lands hereafter made to any alien directly or in trust for such alien shall be void: Provided, That the provisions of this Section shall not apply to lands containing valuable deposits of minerals, metals, iron, coal, or fire-clay, and the necessary land for mills and machinery to be used in the development thereof and the manufacture of the products there from. Every corporation, the majority of the capital stock of which is owned by aliens, shall be considered on alien for the purposes of this prohibition.<span class="style8">&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Immigration Act of Feb 20, 1907</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">This federal legislation created new categories of immigrants that would be denied entry to the United States.&nbsp; Most relevant to the Japanese was the exclusion of people designated as contract laborers.&nbsp; The act also allowed President Theodore Roosevelt to deny entry to United States from Canada, Mexico, and Hawaii (an opportunity taken by Roosevelt on March 14, 1907). Until the 1907 act, many Japanese laborers were coming to the United States via these countries.</span></p>
      <p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Gentlemen&rsquo;s Agreement, 1908</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s presidential order of March 14, 1907 had stemmed the flow of Japanese immigration from Canada, Mexico, and Hawaii.&nbsp; The Gentlemen&rsquo;s Agreement was an unofficial and undocumented treaty that confronted direct immigration.&nbsp; Japan was to issue passports only to those who had previously been admitted to the United States.&nbsp; The Gentlemen&rsquo;s Agreement did allow for Japanese men living in the United States to send for their wives and children in Japan.</span></p>
      <p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Immigration Act of Feb 5, 1917</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">To further restrict Japanese and general Asian immigration, the 1917 act contained two key elements.&nbsp; One was the addition of a literacy test which stated that any person over sixteen years of age had to be literate in some language in order to enter the United States.&nbsp; The other was a major shift to a Caucasian only immigration policy.&nbsp; The 1917 act created a &ldquo;barred zone&rdquo; in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; &ldquo;The barred zone roughly included parts of China, all of India, Burma, Siam, the Malay States, the Asian part of Russia, part of Arabia, part of Afghanistan, most of the Polynesian Islands and the East Indian Islands.</span></p>
      <p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Washington State House Bill Number 79: January 27, 1921</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">During the seventeenth regular session, the Washington State House of Representatives added to the constitutional alien land restrictions.&nbsp; The new legislation extended the alien land laws beyond ownership to limit leasing and renting. The bill also made it a crime for anyone to sell land to an alien, hold land in trust or fail to report alien land use violations to the State Attorney General or local prosecutor.</span></p>
      <p class="arial10"><u> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Immigration Act of May 19, 1921</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 1921 Immigration Act was the first to include any quantitative restrictions on immigration.&nbsp; The Asian &ldquo;barred zone&rdquo; was upheld, but all other immigration was limited to three percent of the foreign-born population of any given group in the United States at the time of the 1910 census.</span></p>
      <p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Washington State House Bill Number 70: January 26, 1923</strong></span></u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The principal way Japanese and other resident aliens circumvented land laws was to have a minor child with birth-right citizenship hold that land deed.&nbsp; The 1923 House Bill ended this practice by declaring land owned by a minor child to be held in trust for an alien (illegal under the 1921 Bill).&nbsp; This heavily restrictive alien land law stayed in effect until its repeal in 1965</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Continuing the trend of restriction, the 1924 Immigration Act used a stricter quota system to further reduce the number of admitted immigrants.&nbsp; While the three percent quota stayed the same, the figures were calculated from the 1890 census.&nbsp; As a result, the total quota number for all immigrants was cut by more than half to approximately 165,000 people. A key section of the 1924 Act denied immigration to persons ineligible for naturalization.&nbsp; Because Japanese immigrants were not among those who could become citizens virtually all Asiatic immigration had been ended.</span></p>

      <p class="arial10">In 1920, Washington State Congressman Albert Johnson convened committee hearings on the question of whether to bar Japanese immigration and citizenship claims. In 1924, Johnson would co-author a bill that effectively closed the countries to non-white immigrants for decades.

      The images below show members of Washington State's Japanese American community arriving at a Temporary Evacuation Center in Puyallup, known as Camp Harmony, in 1942. Such temporary sites were the first stop before forced removal by train to remote forced internment sites inland. For more information on Camp Harmony, visit<a href="http://www.lib.washington.edu/exhibits/harmony/Exhibit/"> the excellent University of Washington Libraries Special Exhibit</a> on the subject.
