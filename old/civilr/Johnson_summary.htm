<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Interview by Trevor Griffey 
and Brooke Clark March 3, 2005</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Summary by Brooke Clark</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">00:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles Johnson was 
born in Mahern, Arkansas. When he was six months his family moved to Little 
Rock, Arkansas where he went to grade school through junior college. He grew up 
in the late 1930s and 40s in total segregation going to segregated schools all 
the way through junior college. He went to Dunbar High School which was near 
Central High School the historic site of the Little Rock Nine integrating the 
school with the help of the National Guard. His mother was a domestic worker in 
various white people houses and his father worked in a boiler room in a 
hospital. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">3:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After junior 
college, he joined the army in 1948 which was after the war had ended. He had 
signed up for two years and the Korean War started and he ended up staying two 
more years for a total of four and spent most of his time in Germany. After 
being discharged, he went on to get his degree at Arkansas A&amp;M at Pine Bluff.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">6:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unit he served 
in was completely segregated and only after he was discharged did President 
Truman desegregate the army. Before he left for the army, he had only been out 
of the South for a Sunday School conference in Chicago. His ultimate goal was to 
go to law school. They were just beginning to desegregate in Arkansas and the 
chances to attend school in Fayetteville were not good because he would have a 
hard time finding employment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">9:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspirations for 
law school came from a career day when he was in high school. He had never seen 
a lawyer and was impressed with the one visiting. Three or four days after 
receiving his degree he packed everything up in his car and drove to Seattle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">11:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived into 
Seattle and started taking classes at the University of Washington law school.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">*12:00&nbsp;&nbsp; His advisor 
encouraged him to take teacher training because he thought the odds were against 
him and he thought he should have something to fall back on. The SAT wasn’t 
offered on his campus, so he wrote the company to have it administered to him at 
his high school. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle was 
completely different that anywhere in the South and his biggest concern was 
finding employment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">14:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Law school was a 
very different experience for him because he went from attending an all black 
school to a majority white school. He was the only black to graduate in his 
class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">16:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After graduating, 
he began working in a private practice and wasn’t able to get a job at the 
prosecutors office where he really wanted to work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">18:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1958, Jack 
Tanner, approached him to try and revive the Seattle Branch of the NAACP. Within 
one year, he became president of the branch and ran a membership drive that 
gathered 1,000 members in six weeks and remained president for 4-5 years.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">22:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first year as 
president of the Seattle NAACP was spent developing the branch. After that, they 
became involved with all civil rights revolution joining with people in the 
South. Issues such as open housing, schools, employment, unions, public 
accommodation, and police community relations and at almost every area to 
desegregate or integrate the total way of life in the South.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">26:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom schools 
were held to point how segregated schools here in Seattle same as in the South 
and that housing patterns created this.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">28:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAACP became 
effective in the 60s and 70s became involved in a lot of activity here. CACRC 
was the umbrella organizations like CORS, NAACP, Urban League, major churches in 
Tacoma, and the heads of each organization met on a regular basis. The NAACP 
major role was to negotiate first, then use direct action.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">33:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was challenging 
to get the powers that be to open up their jobs to minorities in the public as 
well as the private sector.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">36:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some 
accomplishments were open housing legislation and discrimination laws being 
passed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">*37:50&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration of the 
schools and they finally convinced the school district to open up to minorities. 
With police community relations they created freedom patrols which were created 
by the NAACP, which had two members follow the beat police at a safe distance to 
see what they were doing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">41:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was president of 
the NAACP for five years, then went on to be Northwest Area Conference President 
for eight years. In the late sixties, he went onto the National Board of 
Directors in New York for twenty-seven years from 1968-1975 which helped shape 
national policy for the organization. For the majority of the time he chaired 
the legal committee which set national legal policy and vice-chair on branches 
setting policy for 800 branches nationally. He has been active on the local 
board since 1958.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">45:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Northwest Area 
Conference had the same problems that the individual branches had. Issues mainly 
dealt with housing, employment, and police community relations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">48:38&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1969, he became 
a municipal court judge for eleven years. In 1981 he was appointed by the 
governor to superior court and retired in 1998. In 1967, he started Model 
Cities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">50:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He chaired Model 
Cities at the beginning at they hired Walt Hundley as executive directed once 
they had secured the grant.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">52:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model cities had a 
positive effect on the city of Seattle because they had funding for the programs 
they were trying to implement. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">58:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership 
conflicts emerged between the NAACP and the younger Black Panther Party which 
criticized the older generation NAACP members but to a lesser degree than in 
other large cities.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:03:00 A debate emerged in 
the black community of the best strategy to integrate the schools. The question 
was not whether or not they need to desegregate the schools, but how to do it, 
and who should control it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">*1:09:35 The boycott of the 
schools was a success because it stimulated discussion in the school district as 
it had set out to do. Te first step was to integrate the schools, and the second 
was to implement bussing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:11:50 The CACRC ended as a 
result of progress happening, people changing, organizations dispersing, and 
major churches withdrew because they felt that had accomplished what they set 
tout to do.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:14:00 The CACRC was a 
unique multi-cultural organization that helped strengthen the blacks cause 
because as they were meeting with white structure, it helped to have other 
whites supporting their cause.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:16:45 The change in the 
Central Area came as a result of blacks slowly moving out and whites moving back 
in as they were able to buy homes throughout the city.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:21:40 The NAACP was 
heavily involved in major cases dealing with school integration, housing, and 
police community relations. Discrimination is rare now because there are lots of 
laws on the books.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:29:30 The significance of 
the Civil Rights movement locally is because it is important to now your history 
and will be beneficial to African Americans in the future.</span></p>
