	   <p class="arial10"> Tomas Sandoval was born in Sheridan, Wyoming on April 22, 1950. In that same year, his family relocated to Washington State and settled in Pasco.</p>
		  	<p class="arial10">In 1968, Sandoval was part of the first significant cohort of Chicanos recruited by the University of Washington, an effort initiated by the Black Student Union to increase the enrollment of students of color. At the UW, Sandoval was a founding member of the United Mexican American Students (UMAS) which later became MEChA. He was also active in the anti-Vietnam War movement.</p>
		  	<p class="arial10">Starting in 1972, Sandoval became the Director of Activos Mexicanos—a federally funded Office of Equal Opportunity program that began in 1969. The purpose of Activos was to provide transition services to Chicanos moving to Seattle. These services included emergency housing, employment referrals, translation assistance, and legal support.  Sandoval recalls that Activos was in turmoil when he took leadership of the organization. While Sandoval worked to get Activos back on track, he faced stiff opposition and left Activos in 1974.</p>
		  	<p class="arial10"> Sandoval continued to work with the Latino community and served as a board member for the Washington State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. He was also involved with Washington’s Hispanic Democratic Caucus and worked on Booth Gardner’s political campaign for governor. He remains active with the North Central Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Wenatchee, Washington.</p>
		  	<p class="arial10">Tomas Sandoval was interviewed by Josue Q. Estrada at the University of Washington on July 25, 2014.</p>
