          <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aki Kurose, a teacher and longtime activist, spoke these words towards the end of her life in the late 1990's. Filled with idealism and hope, the comments are emblematic of Kurose's enduring commitment to peace, a dedication that continued and even deepened despite her own encounters with discrimination and prejudice. Shaped by the years she spent in the United States&rsquo; World War II-era, Japanese incarceration camps as well as by her upbringing in a diverse neighborhood and her parent's progressive understanding of race and ethnicity, Kurose became an active participant and a leader in a host of Seattle movements and organizations, including the American Friends Service Committee, Head Start and an open housing coalition. A passionate and outspoken advocate for equality, Kurose's understanding of race and racism shaped the many forms her activism took over more than fifty years spent advocating for peace and justice.</span></p>
			<p class="style6"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> Growing up in a diverse Seattle neighborhood</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the outset, Akiko Kato&rsquo;s (later Kurose) life differed from what one might expect in a pre-World War II American metropolis, especially in regards to her experience of racial segregation. Born in 1925, she lived with her family in the Central District of Seattle in an ethnically and culturally diverse neighborhood.&nbsp; There were &ldquo;many Jews and a Chinese family, and several black families,&rdquo; and many of these neighborhood children became Kurose&rsquo;s playmates and lifelong friends, remaining in touch and &ldquo;together for over sixty-five years.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp; The local elementary school, Bailey Gazert, mirrored the community&rsquo;s diversity. It &ldquo;had always served Seattle&rsquo;s immigrant children&rdquo; and boasted a blend of students of different minorities.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title="">[3]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflecting on her childhood, Kurose recalled that multiculturalism &ldquo;was not something that I even thought of at that time.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title="">[4]</a>&nbsp; Instead of feeling forced or overanalyzed, it was &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;spontaneous;&rdquo; in fact, looking back on her early life, it seemed clear to her that class and &ldquo;economics, more than [&hellip;] race&rdquo;, were the defining element in shaping the relationships and interactions within the community.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title="">[5]</a>&nbsp; Like many children, Kurose was still largely unaware of her particular ethnic identity as a Japanese-American and had not yet experienced the full vitriol of racial prejudice, thanks in part to the diversity of her environment. Her area of town was &ldquo;considered more or less [&hellip;] the ghetto,&rdquo; which effectively meant that both her neighborhood and her elementary school were &ldquo;already segregated,&rdquo; she just &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t realize it because this was the accepted norm.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title="">[6]</a> &nbsp;The fact that she lived there &ndash; as opposed to in a predominantly white area &ndash; sheltered her, to some degree, from racism&rsquo;s uglier expressions and kept her from developing a deep sense of racial consciousness during her younger years.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Kurose&rsquo;s age and surroundings shielded her from seeing some of the baser forms of discrimination, life for Japanese-Americans in the mid-twentieth century was undeniably constrained by institutional racism. Japanese immigrants started to come to the United States in large numbers after passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.&nbsp; In the forty years from 1890 to 1930, their numbers, which were concentrated on the West Coast, jumped from 2,000 to 138,000 &ndash; an increase of nearly seventy fold.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title="">[7]</a>&nbsp; From the very beginning, Japanese immigrants experienced the pervasive nature of racial discrimination in American society. They faced segregation as well as outright physical violence against both themselves and their property. People spit on them, threw things at them and vandalized their businesses, the &ldquo;store windows smashed and the sidewalks in front smeared with horse manure.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title="">[8]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Residential and occupational opportunities were also severely limited. Realtors worried that a Japanese presence would cause land values to plummet, making it very difficult to rent or buy houses, and the immigrants &ndash; no matter their educational background &ndash; were usually confined to low-end jobs because &ldquo;they were unable to find employment in white-owned companies.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title="">[9]</a>&nbsp; This scenario played out tragically in Kurose&rsquo;s own life when her brother-in-law, an American citizen with degrees in both aeronautical and electrical engineering, could not find employment in the U.S. after graduating college in 1939. He eventually found work in Japan, but, while there,  was &ldquo;dragooned&rdquo; into the Japanese army and died in battle.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title="">[10]</a>&nbsp; Such instances reveal the sobering reality that racial discrimination could, in fact, make the difference between life and death.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of these obstacles, the Japanese were able to carve a social and economic niche for themselves through the establishment of the <em>Nihonmachi</em><em>,</em> or Little Tokyo sections of town.&nbsp; In this way, they could &ldquo;feel comfortable among compatriots&rdquo; and &ldquo;make connections for employment,&rdquo; while, to a certain degree, avoiding discrimination.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title="">[11]</a>&nbsp; The Japanese had learned from the example set by the Chinese, whose involvement in manufacturing and trade occupations had &ldquo;provoked stormy protests from white workers and led to exclusionary laws.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title="">[12]</a>&nbsp; In the interest of avoiding similar conflicts, Japanese laborers pursued occupations that involved less competition with white workers.&nbsp; A large number found success in farming and agriculture, where&nbsp;their intensive and successful cultivation of the land gave them a significant share of the market on the West Coast.&nbsp; In fact, by 1920, Japanese farms in California produced approximately 10 percent of the total value of the state&rsquo;s crops, transforming &ldquo;marginal lands&rdquo; into &ldquo;lush and profitable agricultural fields and orchards.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title="">[13]</a> &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p><span class="style6"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Discrimination and Prejudice in Work and Housing </span></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This success proved bittersweet, however, as the community soon learned that white Americans &ldquo;resented not only Japanese competition but their very presence in America.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title="">[14]</a>&nbsp; Labor unions, school boards, and even the President, promoted the segregation and exclusion of the Japanese. President Theodore Roosevelt made several efforts to limit Japanese immigration, issuing an executive order and then drawing up the Gentlemen&rsquo;s Agreement with Japan in 1908, which established &ldquo;an understanding that Japan would not permit the emigration of laborers to the United States.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title="">[15]</a>&nbsp; This act was followed in 1924 by a new immigration law that, while not expressly naming the Japanese, &ldquo;singled [them] out for special discriminatory treatment,&rdquo; since other nationalities to which it could apply had already been excluded through other laws.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title="">[16]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to immigration limits, the Japanese also faced restrictions under alien land laws passed before and during this period.&nbsp; In Washington State, for instance, the state constitution (1889) prevented &ldquo;ownership of lands by aliens, other than those who in good faith have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title="">[17]</a>&nbsp; This almost automatically disqualified Japanese immigrants from owning land, because according to the Naturalization Act of 1790 and its subsequent revisions, Asian immigrants were ineligible for citizenship.&nbsp; The Act stated that &ldquo;any alien being a free white person [&hellip;] may be admitted to become a citizen,&rdquo; and while one significant amendment included people of African descent in 1870, Asian minorities remained excluded.<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title="">[18]</a>&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alien Land Bill, passed in 1921 &ldquo;in response to the growing number of Japanese immigrants,&rdquo; was &ldquo;intended to toughen [the land laws] by enacting procedural mechanisms,&rdquo; which narrowed definitions and introduced other restrictions to further obstruct the Japanese from owning property.<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title="">[19]</a>&nbsp; In California, aliens ineligible for citizenship were allowed to lease agricultural land &ldquo;for terms of no longer than three years,&rdquo; effectively meaning that they could not build up any sort of long-term investment in the land&rsquo;s productive value.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title="">[20]</a>&nbsp; In many cases, Japanese were able to work around these laws. Some would buy land in the names of their American-born children, while others would find white citizens willing to purchase tracts for them.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title="">[21]</a>&nbsp; These constraints affected Kurose&rsquo;s family as well. Unable to buy property, they instead leased an apartment building in Seattle, where Kurose&rsquo;s mother served as the manager.</span></p>
			<p><span class="style7">Social Justice and Family Values</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurose&rsquo;s home life differed significantly from other Japanese-Americans in the Pacific Northwest. Her parents, for example, did not follow a rigid division of labor. Her mother &ldquo;got the engineer&rsquo;s license, she ran the boiler room,&rdquo; she &ldquo;wallpaper[ed] right along with [Kurose&rsquo;s father], standing on a ladder and just going at it.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title="">[22]</a>&nbsp; While there was a clear &ldquo;separation&rdquo; in gender roles and a &ldquo;chauvinistic, sexist philosophy imposed&rdquo; in many other relationships in her community, Kurose did not see this reflected in her parents&rsquo; marriage.<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title="">[23]</a>&nbsp; Her mother, in particular, occupied many positions in the public and private spheres, providing Kurose with&nbsp;a uniquely strong female role model.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not the only quality that set her family apart - the value they placed on cultural inclusiveness also made them distinctive and served as a critical factor in influencing Kurose&rsquo;s understanding of and approach to race.&nbsp; Indeed, it was not until her own marriage that she became aware of the prejudices held by her own community. Kurose recalled being &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; when she learned about &ldquo;those kind of biases among the [broader Japanese-American] community,&rdquo; because she and her siblings &ldquo;weren&rsquo;t raised that way, and anybody was welcomed&rdquo; in her home; she &ldquo;was never told you can&rsquo;t play with people because they&rsquo;re of a different group.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title="">[24]</a>&nbsp; This open-minded philosophy was evident in her parents&rsquo; tradition of inviting the entire neighborhood to dinners at their apartment or in the fact that they &ldquo;celebrated the Jewish holidays as well as the Japanese holidays.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title="">[25]</a>&nbsp; To Kurose, it seemed normal that &ldquo;black kids could come to my house as well as white kids&rdquo; &ndash; in fact, they &ldquo;went in and out of each other&rsquo;s homes all the time.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title="">[26]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way of life stood in stark contrast to some traditions that existed in the broader Japanese-American community, which perpetuated class and race-based discrimination.&nbsp; One example was the treatment of <em>etas</em> or descendants of social outcasts who faced stigmatization because Buddhist tradition viewed their professions, involving animal slaughter or disposal of bodies, as unclean.&nbsp; The stigma associated with them was passed down through the generations and continued upon the move to the States, where other Japanese-Americans &ldquo;considered them lower class&rdquo; and &ldquo;look[ed] down at people of that group.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title="">[27]</a>&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the larger Japanese-American community also held strong prejudices against African-Americans and did not generally associate with them. &nbsp;To a certain degree, Kurose was aware of the disapproving whispers that surrounded her family&rsquo;s lifestyle; in fact, she would hear other children&rsquo;s parents say things like, &ldquo;Well, they shouldn&rsquo;t bring a black to the house.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title="">[28]</a>&nbsp; However, in spite of this criticism, her parents did not succumb to the pressure to distance themselves from African-Americans, as demonstrated by their choice of Japanese schools for their children. Most <em>issei</em>, or first-generation Japanese-American parents, sent their children to Japanese school, and Kurose&rsquo;s family followed this standard practice of instilling the language and culture of their heritage in their children.&nbsp; Kurose and her siblings, however, attended a less popular school, other Japanese-Americans looked down on it as &ldquo;inferior,&rdquo; no doubt due, at least in part, to the fact that one of its teachers was black.<a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title="">[29]</a>&nbsp; In this, we see that it was not only the structures around Kurose &ndash; the diversity of her school and neighborhood, for instance, which influenced her outlook &ndash; but also her parents&rsquo; willingness to participate and embrace those structures that instilled in her an acceptance of difference and diversity. </span></p>
			<p><span class="style7">Pearl Harbor, Executive Order 9066 and Incarceration</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, Kurose was somewhat aware of race, but its full weight did not hit her until the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. She recalled that at school the next day, her teacher said something that gave her pause: &ldquo;You people bombed Pearl Harbor.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title="">[30]</a>&nbsp; The accusatory tone and identification of Kurose as &lsquo;other&rsquo; radically shifted her perception of herself and her place in the United States. &nbsp;At sixteen years old, she remained immersed in high school and paid little attention to world politics; she knew that she looked different from some of her classmates, but in her mind, her status as an American came before her ethnic ties to Japan. &nbsp;While she had been certain of her identity and allegiances, Kurose saw that she was no longer &ldquo;being considered [&hellip;] an American citizen like everybody else,&rdquo; but that instead, &ldquo;due to my racial features I was being considered an enemy.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title="">[31]</a>&nbsp; That small interaction with her teacher lodged itself firmly in her memory and served as an awakening point in her journey with race.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that point forward, Kurose&rsquo;s &ldquo;Japaneseness became very, very prominent&rdquo; to her; strangers would make comments, tossing around racial slurs as she and her sister walked along the street.<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title="">[32]</a>&nbsp; She felt socially constricted in a way that was unfamiliar and uncomfortable. While she was &ldquo;angry&rdquo; that the government had imposed a curfew specifically on Japanese-Americans, she did not &ldquo;discuss it openly among white people&rdquo; because she was &ldquo;afraid as to how anything might be interpreted.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title="">[33]</a>&nbsp; With these doubts introduced about her identity as an American, Kurose felt a change in the way that other people saw her, which made her question her own self-image.&nbsp; Her view of the world was still evolving, however, and though her teacher&rsquo;s reaction was certainly jarring and upsetting, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t seem to affect me&rdquo; to the point that it did others, she later remembered.<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title="">[34]</a> &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bombing of Pearl Harbor proved the deciding factor in pushing the United States to enter World War II. &nbsp;The attack brought anti-Japanese racism to the surface at both a personal level, as Kurose experienced in the classroom, and soon enough, at a systemic level as well.&nbsp; First, came the setting of an &nbsp;ethnic-specific curfew, and then, in early 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which, although it made no explicit mention of the Japanese, was directed towards them. &nbsp;The E.O. designated a zone along the Pacific coast as a military area &ldquo;from which any or all persons may be excluded,&rdquo; and in the spring of 1942, the United States government incarcerated around 120,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans in camps around the country.<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title="">[35]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before transport to the camps, which were located inland to reduce the potential threat of Japanese-American collaboration with the Japanese army, the detainees gathered at intermediate centers. Kurose and her family went first to Puyallup Assembly Center known as Camp Harmony, where poor conditions reflected the haste with which the site came together. &ldquo;Animal stalls [had been] converted to living quarters&rdquo;, and medical facilities were lacking &ndash; in fact, one woman&rsquo;s doctor was so horrified at the conditions that rather than have her give birth there, he induced her into labor a month early, when she was still in Seattle.<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title="">[36]</a> The system of administration was similarly inadequate; Kurose&rsquo;s father came down with appendicitis while there, but &ldquo;because of the red tape you have to go through, his appendix was ruptured.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" title="">[37]</a> &nbsp;Not only were there numerous physical and material difficulties at these centers, but Japanese-Americans also endured significant psychological hardships.&nbsp; People would come by and stare at them through the fence; some would be kind, but others would &ldquo;sneer at you and make comments&rdquo; like &ldquo;&rsquo;Jap, go back.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" title="">[38]</a> &nbsp;At this moment, Kurose was certainly more aware of her race and acknowledged that their treatment was &ldquo;unfair,&rdquo; but this understanding did not yet extend to the point of seeing a connection to politics and civil rights &ndash; in her words, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I went to that depth of thinking.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title="">[39]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After staying at Camp Harmony for a few months, Kurose and her family were relocated to the incarceration camp at Minidoka in rural southern Idaho, where conditions were just as austere as they had been at Puyallup. &nbsp;While there, Kurose identified some of the injustices that the Japanese-American community was facing and began to find her political voice.&nbsp; It became clearer that the Japanese-American incarceration was based solely on race and she realized that &ldquo;[t]his isn&rsquo;t really the normal kind of thing that should be happening to people.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title="">[40]</a>&nbsp; The irony of life in the camp began to strike her; while in school, students had to &ldquo;salute the flag every day and sing the national anthem,&rdquo; and one assignment even had them write about why they were proud to be American.<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title="">[41]</a>&nbsp; When the U.S. started recruiting men from the camps to serve in the armed forces in the war, she &ldquo;felt it was wrong&rdquo; and began to speak out about it, even sending some antiwar literature to some of her friends who were in the service.<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title="">[42]</a>&nbsp; Kurose&rsquo;s experience in camp sharpened both her racial consciousness and her sense of justice, and she began to recognize the interplay between the two, recognizing that race was often a root cause of injustice.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Kurose became more aware of the world beyond herself, her parents played a large role in directing her path towards activism.&nbsp; She saw some of her peers and elders reacting to incarceration with bitterness and anger, an understandable response given the circumstances, but Kurose&rsquo;s story played out differently.&nbsp; Her mother was forgiving and &ldquo;positive-thinking,&rdquo; and she remembers her father, in particular, as a &ldquo;strong pacifist.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title="">[43]</a>&nbsp; They told her, &ldquo;This is war, this is what happens.&nbsp; In wartime, people do crazy things.&nbsp; So we mustn&rsquo;t be bitter, but we must think in terms of never having war again.&nbsp; So we must work for peace.&rsquo;<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title="">[44]</a>&nbsp; Those words embedded themselves in Kurose&rsquo;s mind and helped to direct her indignation towards war rather than towards other people. She saw that her parents were determined to make the best of the situation, and through both words and actions, they set a positive example of how to deal with the traumatic experience of racism and incarceration. Because of her parents&rsquo; insistence that &ldquo;There is no justice when war takes place,&rdquo; Kurose made an express connection between the two.<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title="">[45]</a> &nbsp;Her time in camp marked a crucial turning point in the development of both her racial consciousness and her voice, and in this definitive moment, her parents provided direction that would become foundational to her style of pacifism and activism.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurose&rsquo;s growth in camp prepared her for the discrimination she would face upon reentry into a predominantly white American society. Thanks to a Quaker-sponsored student relocation program intended specifically for incarcerated Japanese-Americans, Kurose was actually able to leave camp during the war to attend school in Salt Lake City, where her experiences with racism continued.&nbsp; Her homestay family put her to work as a maid, kept her from going to school, and threatened to send her back to camp if she complained.<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title="">[46]</a> &nbsp;It is worth noting that while her treatment was unfair &ndash; even extreme &ndash; it did not ultimately surprise her, which is&nbsp;an ironic testament to the growth in her racial consciousness.&nbsp; Kurose soon transferred to continue her schooling elsewhere, but the harshness of the racism she experienced in Utah was emblematic of the continued discrimination faced by &nbsp;Japanese-Americans.&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Post-War Life and the Fight Against Discrimination</span></strong></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the war ended, Kurose saw the reality that even serving in the U.S. military did not make a difference in the treatment experienced by Japanese-Americans.&nbsp; Her brother, who had volunteered for duty during World War II, was often denied service by restaurants even when he was in uniform. In the cases where establishments &ldquo;were told they must [serve Japanese-Americans], employees would even go so far as s to put ashes in the Coke.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title="">[47]</a> &nbsp;Because of incarceration, Kurose was more conscious of the racism that surrounded her, and she used this increased awareness to fuel her desire to seek social justice.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon her family&rsquo;s return to Seattle, she embarked upon what would become a lifetime journey in activism.&nbsp; She directed her energy down multiple avenues of peace and justice, and some, such as her involvement in a multiracial porters&rsquo; union, were very active and direct.&nbsp; Before the war, her father and many other Japanese-Americans had worked as porters at the Seattle railroad station, but during their forced incarceration, African-Americans filled the vacated positions.&nbsp; When the Japanese-Americans returned, the two groups were &ldquo;pitted against each other&rdquo; as the railroad looked to give the jobs back to the Japanese-Americans. Rather than accept these divisions, her father decided to form a porters&rsquo; union, saying that the two groups would &ldquo;both benefit from it.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" title="">[48]</a> Kurose acted as the union&rsquo;s secretary, and from that point forward, she was very involved in issues of civil and labor rights.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this same period, she also worked as a secretary for the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC). She participated in marches that they sponsored and she &ldquo;learned a lot&rdquo; about the AFSC&rsquo;s activities, locally and globally &ndash; for her, &ldquo;it just fit right in with a lot of my beliefs.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title="">[49]</a> The group was heavily involved in the open housing movement, which Kurose later joined, and was &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; in identifying housing discrimination and in encouraging &ldquo;mobility of people of different ethnic groups [&hellip;] into areas that were so-called white areas.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title="">[50]</a>&nbsp; They also supported protests and marches organized around civil rights issues.&nbsp; Kurose and her fellow activists &nbsp;highly valued interracial cooperation and it was this willingness to cross ethnic lines, which contributed to the effectiveness of their movements.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such effort was the campaign for open housing in Seattle, which Kurose joined after experiencing racial discrimination in housing firsthand. &nbsp;She and her husband had moved to Chicago after marrying in 1948, but they decided to return to Seattle upon the birth of their first child.&nbsp; While looking for housing, they encountered deeply entrenched racial barriers.&nbsp; Although &ldquo;restrictive covenants were illegal,&rdquo; the established residents had made a &ldquo;verbal agreement among homeowners not to let Japanese or blacks over this side of the hill&rdquo; and had drawn up a physical document that read, &ldquo;No blacks, no Jews, no Asians.&rsquo;<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title="">[51]</a> &nbsp;While Kurose and her husband were eventually able to buy a house, the discrimination that they experienced led her to become an activist on the issue. &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement was substantial, involving not only individuals but organizations as well; the Seattle chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), for example, formed in 1961 to advocate in the areas of open housing, education reform, and employer discrimination, was heavily involved as was the AFSC. &nbsp;Kurose and others engaged in protesting in this &ldquo;multiracial effort&rdquo; as well as in &ldquo;identifying different real estate companies and areas where discrimination existed [and] identifying the groups that were actually practicing this discrimination.&rdquo; <a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title="">[52]</a> &nbsp;While their efforts managed to put some open housing measures on the ballots, these were defeated.&nbsp; In the long run, however, their activities provided the groundwork for the movement and contributed to later successes in fighting housing discrimination.</span></p>
			<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Teaching and Education Activism</span></strong></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these organizations and movements employed direct-action to promote peace and justice, Kurose also engaged in less visible struggles to achieve her goals.&nbsp; Concerned that underprivileged children were &ldquo;being ignored&rdquo; or &ldquo;not being cared for properly,&rdquo;she and some other parents organized Seattle&rsquo;s Head Start program, which provided preschool children with a comprehensive curriculum to meet their social, emotional, and psychological needs.<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" title="">[53]</a>&nbsp; While this may not fit with a traditional view of activism, such activities still work against the injustices in the educational system.&nbsp; Kurose continued in this line by moving into the classroom herself in the mid-70s, teaching kindergarten and first-grade at Martin Luther King Elementary. However, the following year, she was transferred to Laurelhurst Elementary due to a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare mandate that &ldquo;no minority teacher could teach in a minority impacted school.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" title="">[54]</a>&nbsp; She was very reluctant to go and &ldquo;put up a fight,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;&rsquo;I was educated to teach children, not certain kinds of children,&rsquo;&rdquo; but the district&rsquo;s decision stood, and she began teaching at Laurelhurst in 1976.<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" title="">[55]</a>&nbsp; During her time there, she faced racism from all sides &ndash; parents, teachers, and even students, to some degree.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she arrived, Laurelhurst was overwhelmingly white; Kurose and an African-American woman were the only minority teachers there, a fact that was evident from the outset. &nbsp;The summer before she started teaching, Laurelhurst parents called a meeting at one of their homes, where they interrogated Kurose to see for themselves whether she was qualified to teach their children.&nbsp; The parents were upset because, as part of the desegregation process, one of the teachers at Laurelhurst had also been transferred. One woman expressed her anger about these events to Kurose by saying that, &ldquo;The only reason you have this job is you&rsquo;re a minority, and you&rsquo;ve displaced and replaced one of the best teachers in the district.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" title="">[56]</a>&nbsp; </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her first year, Kurose remembered that &ldquo;parents were walking in and out of my classroom, constantly questioning me about the curriculum,&rdquo; effectively making the experience &ldquo;hell on earth.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" title="">[57]</a> Parents were not the only ones to fixate on her ethnicity; the racism of other teachers also proved significant. In her first year, the staff was having a Christmas party, and some of the teachers asked Kurose not to bring her husband as their spouses had been in the military and &quot;they [would not] feel comfortable&rdquo; if Kurose&rsquo;s Japanese-American husband came.&nbsp; She told them several times that her husband had also been in the American army, but &ldquo;they couldn&rsquo;t quite understand that.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" title="">[58]</a> &nbsp;Finally, racism came even from some of her elementary-school children.&nbsp; At the beginning of the school year, one child said outright, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to have a Jap for a teacher.&rdquo; The student's mother was slightly embarrassed, saying that he was not supposed to repeat that outside of their home, but she proceeded to withdraw him from the class.<a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" title="">[59]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this adversity, Kurose persevered in carrying her passions for peace, justice, and multiculturalism into the classroom. She insisted on the values of mutual respect and appreciation of differences. She tried to give her students some &ldquo;perspective of their place on planet Earth&rdquo; and had her class start each day by singing greeting songs in different languages, which helped her students to realize that &ldquo;different languages are beautiful and not funny and something to laugh at.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" title="">[60]</a> She disapproved of the &ldquo;glorification of war&rdquo; communicated through current curricula and worked with people in the community, &ldquo;trying to get a peace curriculum passed through the legislature.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" title="">[61]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was vitally important to her that students learn about peace, but she was also passionate about &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; teachers to &ldquo;the beauty of a multicultural [&hellip;] aspect of education.&rdquo; Kurose emphasized that for both teachers and students to receive a complete education, &ldquo;peace and cultural pluralism [should be] integrated into the whole curriculum.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" title="">[62]</a>&nbsp; Her dedication to peace led her to take a holistic view of the point of education, which resulted in a genuine interest in her students&rsquo; development as people.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her dedication to students and the results that it produced did not go unrecognized.&nbsp; She received numerous awards and was on President Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s advisory board for the education of disadvantaged children.<a href="#_edn63" name="_ednref63" title="">[63]</a>&nbsp; Even with these prestigious positions and awards, though, she was not afraid to raise her voice against what she believed to be wrong, even if that meant speaking against people in positions of power.&nbsp; In 1986, she received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics.&nbsp; She went to meet with President George H.W. Bush and lectured him on his educational policies, urging him to change. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to be our &lsquo;education president&rsquo;,&quot; she said, &quot;but you don&rsquo;t show it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re allotting all this money to the military, when all these children need education. [&hellip;] One stealth bomber would pay for the salary of hundreds of teachers.&nbsp; Two stealth bombers would probably supply many good school districts. You need to change your priorities.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn64" name="_ednref64" title="">[64]</a></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did a similar thing in 1997, when a Trident submarine arrived in Seattle for the annual summer festival Seafair on the anniversary of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima.&nbsp; It was purportedly a &ldquo;key part of the United States nuclear deterrent strategy,&rdquo; but to Kurose, it was &ldquo;an outrage&rdquo; and a &ldquo;bad message&rdquo; that Seattle would &ldquo;bring an instrument of death to celebrate Seafair.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" title="">[65]</a>&nbsp; In the afternoon, she picketed the submarine, before joining the mayor and the submarine&rsquo;s crew for dinner in the evening.&nbsp; Seated next to the captain, she lectured him on peace, telling him, &ldquo;&rsquo;We like you, but we don&rsquo;t like your business.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" title="">[66]</a>&nbsp; Speaking out in that way has the potential to jeopardize a person&rsquo;s public image or career, but Kurose&rsquo;s convictions overpowered any qualms she had about taking such risks.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both through her involvement in political movements and organizations and through her work in the classroom, Kurose pursued her ideal of peace, which to her &ldquo;among other things mean[t] conflict resolution.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67" title="">[67]</a>&nbsp; By this way of looking at it, peace is not simply the absence of conflict, but also the resolution of disputes. Its fundamental purpose is to empower people and promote social justice and understanding. &nbsp;Kurose&rsquo;s dedication to this ideal was not &ldquo;the most popular stance,&rdquo; and her very active role in peace movements did not sit well &ldquo;with the veterans and the NVC [Nisei Veterans Committee].&rdquo;<a href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" title="">[68]</a>&nbsp; At times, she was &ldquo;labeled as a Communist&rdquo; and criticized for being unpatriotic, and a lobbyist once urged her to use other language besides the word &quot;peace.&quot;<a href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69" title="">[69]</a> In spite of these outside pressures,  she stood firm in her convictions.&nbsp; One symbol of this dedication was a button she wore wherever she went, no matter how formal the function; it read, &ldquo;If we are to teach real peace in this world, we will have to begin with the children.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" title="">[70]</a></span></p>
			<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Conclusion </span></strong></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurose died in 1998 after a long battle with cancer, but her legacy lives on today. She has a peace garden, a scholarship, and a science fair named after her and, in honor of her role in the open housing movement, the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) named a North Seattle affordable housing development in her honor.<a href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71" title="">[71]</a>&nbsp; In addition, her devotion to peace and social activism was such a deep part of her identity that a middle school with a &ldquo;troubled academic past&rdquo; chose to rename itself after her to &ldquo;signal a new beginning.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72" title="">[72]</a> Perhaps her biggest legacies, though, are the countless children and families whose lives she inspired through her teaching.&nbsp;</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Kurose&rsquo;s life, her activism took many forms. <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Her increased awareness of and sensitivity to racial issues led first to a personal awakening and then to a lifelong passion to fight for an end to injustice and discrimination.</span> She participated and organized protests and marches and made speeches in front of enormous crowds. She also engaged in less high-profile, but equally important forms of activism, like teaching and educational reform. Kurose&rsquo;s long journey started with a heightened racial consciousness that took shape in the incarceration camps and under her parents' progressive influence and evolved over more than fifty years of work for socal justice causes. </span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The prohibition of alien land ownership was included in the original 1889 version of the Washington State constitution.&nbsp; This was not true of the constitutions of other western states with significant alien populations.&nbsp; The primary reason for the alien land article was that the Washington constitution (unlike states that pre-dated Washington) was enacted after the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="arial10">Article II, Section 33 - &nbsp;&ldquo;OWNERSHIP OF LANDS BY ALIENS, PROHIBITED - Exceptions - The ownership of lands by aliens, other than those who in good faith have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, is prohibited in this state, except where acquired by inheritance, under mortgage or in good faith in the ordinary course of justice in the collection of debts; and all conveyances of lands hereafter made to any alien directly or in trust for such alien shall be void: Provided, That the provisions of this Section shall not apply to lands containing valuable deposits of minerals, metals, iron, coal, or fire-clay, and the necessary land for mills and machinery to be used in the development thereof and the manufacture of the products there from. Every corporation, the majority of the capital stock of which is owned by aliens, shall be considered on alien for the purposes of this prohibition.<span class="style8">&quot;</span></p>

Until the 1907 act, many Japanese laborers were coming to the United States via these countries.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">To further restrict Japanese and general Asian immigration, the 1917 act contained two key elements.&nbsp; One was the addition of a literacy test which stated that any person over sixteen years of age had to be literate in some language in order to enter the United States.&nbsp; The other was a major shift to a Caucasian only immigration policy.&nbsp; The 1917 act created a &ldquo;barred zone&rdquo; in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; &ldquo;The barred zone roughly included parts of China, all of India, Burma, Siam, the Malay States, the Asian part of Russia, part of Arabia, part of Afghanistan, most of the Polynesian Islands and the East Indian Islands.</span></p>
	<p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Washington State House Bill Number 79: January 27, 1921</strong></span></u></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">During the seventeenth regular session, the Washington State House of Representatives added to the constitutional alien land restrictions.&nbsp; The new legislation extended the alien land laws beyond ownership to limit leasing and renting. The bill also made it a crime for anyone to sell land to an alien, hold land in trust or fail to report alien land use violations to the State Attorney General or local prosecutor.</span></p>
	<p class="arial10"><u> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Immigration Act of May 19, 1921</strong></span></u></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 1921 Immigration Act was the first to include any quantitative restrictions on immigration.&nbsp; The Asian &ldquo;barred zone&rdquo; was upheld, but all other immigration was limited to three percent of the foreign-born population of any given group in the United States at the time of the 1910 census.</span></p>
	<p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Washington State House Bill Number 70: January 26, 1923</strong></span></u></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The principal way Japanese and other resident aliens circumvented land laws was to have a minor child with birth-right citizenship hold that land deed.&nbsp; The 1923 House Bill ended this practice by declaring land owned by a minor child to be held in trust for an alien (illegal under the 1921 Bill).&nbsp; This heavily restrictive alien land law stayed in effect until its repeal in 1965</span></p>
	<p class="arial10"><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><strong>Immigration Act of May 26, 1924</strong></span></u></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"> <span class="arial10" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Continuing the trend of restriction, the 1924 Immigration Act used a stricter quota system to further reduce the number of admitted immigrants.&nbsp; While the three percent quota stayed the same, the figures were calculated from the 1890 census.&nbsp; As a result, the total quota number for all immigrants was cut by more than half to approximately 165,000 people. A key section of the 1924 Act denied immigration to persons ineligible for naturalization.&nbsp; Because Japanese immigrants were not among those who could become citizens virtually all Asiatic immigration had been ended.</span></p>

<p class="arial10">One of the organizations most active in the movement for open housing was the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). The Seattle chapter, founded in 1961, employed the non-violent direct action techniques of the South against discriminatory practices in the city. </p>
<p class="arial10">From 1961 through 1964, and with the cooperation of other organizations, CORE engaged in highly public dont buy where you cant work campaigns against individual stores for not hiring African Americans. These protests culminated in the winter of 1964 with a boycott of Seattles entire downtown retail establishment in a campaign called the Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown Stores (DEEDS). <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/CORE_intro.htm">Learn more about CORE in the special section on the organization and other Central Area Civil Rights Campaigns</a>.
