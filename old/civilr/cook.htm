          <p class="arial10">		    Mark Cook was born and raised in Seattle, growing up in a poor family and

		      moving frequently from school to school.&nbsp;At the age of 17, he was arrested,

		      sent to a state mental hospital, and subsequently abused by the facility

		      staff.&nbsp;Later, he served a sentence for armed robbery.
<p class="arial10">Released in 1967,

		      Cook became active in a growing leftist paramilitary underground in Seattle,

		      which perpetrated a series of high profile bombings and robberies. In and

		      out of prison, he was co-founder of the Black Panther Party chapter in the

		      Walla Walla State Penitentiary and served as its Lieutenant of Information

		      for many years. In 2000, he was released after serving 24 years in prison

		      for his participation in a bank robbery and jail break associated with the

		      George Jackson Brigade in Seattle. His interview provides a detailed and

		      startlingly honest account of the social organization and violence of prison

		      life, as well as his extensive efforts to improve the conditions for prisoners.&nbsp; </p>
		    <p class="arial10">Mark Cook discussed his experiences in a videotaped interview conducted

		      by Janet Jones on&nbsp;May 27, 2005. To the right are streaming-video excerpts,

		      most about a minute in length.</p>
