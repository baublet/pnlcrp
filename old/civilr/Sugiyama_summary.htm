born and raised in Seattle, his grandfather came from Japan in 1899 and returned 
to Japan to marry and then returned to Seattle.&nbsp; Alan’s mother was born in 
Seattle and his father was born in Japan and came to Seattle at the age of 11.&nbsp; 
The Sugiyama’s have been in Seattle for four generations. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">3:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relocation to the 
camps, his parents did not speak of this topic much because they were 
embarrassed about internment.&nbsp; Alan explains how his generation was the 
generation to bring the issue of internment to the forefront.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">3:48&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle Central 
Community College experiences, Alan explains how there was a minority history 
class but it mainly focused on African-Americans and Mexican-Americans, only 
spending one week on Asian-Americans.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">4:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan created the 
Oriental Student Union, they used the Black Student Union as an example to 
theirs.&nbsp; Their goals were to get Asian-American courses and Asian-American 
Faculty. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">5:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan shares a 
little about his childhood in Seattle, he explains that they did not realize 
segregation until they went outside the International District areas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">7:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stokely Carmichael 
came to Seattle in the late 1960’s he visited Garfield High School at the height 
of the civil rights movement.&nbsp; Faculty of the school district did not want 
Stokely to come and speak because of his radical nature.&nbsp; The students protested 
to get Stokely to speak.&nbsp; This was the first time Alan heard the term 
Asian-American.&nbsp; Stokely changed the atmosphere at Garfield, people began to try 
to get along, and this lit the way for African Americans. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">10:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation of a 
rivalry between Garfield High School, a minority school, and Ballard High 
School, a predominantly white school.&nbsp; Alan explains about a particular sporting 
event at Garfield High School where the Ballard students are not allowed to 
drive and are taken on busses to Garfield.&nbsp; The Garfield students end up 
vandalizing the Ballard busses. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">11:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The summer of 
1967-1968 a lot of protest was seen, mainly African-Americans taking out anger 
and frustrations on Asian-American businesses.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">12:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asian-American 
movement begins, tensions between African-Americans and Asian-Americans rise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">12:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students become 
more involved in the civil rights movements and become the leader of the 
movements.&nbsp; They develop new programs and classes at Seattle Central Community 
College.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">14:20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Involvement with 
Black Student Unions in college.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">14:50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation of the 
Black Panther Party, this was the first type of organization to play a key role 
with the student unions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">15:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asian Coalition for 
Equality began in 1966-1967, Alan was not involved with this organization.&nbsp; He 
remembered the group because it was one of the first to have Asian-Americans 
speak out in the community.&nbsp; The group believed that they needed to support 
African-American movements. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">18:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan founded the 
Oriental Student Union at Seattle Central Community College.&nbsp; He wanted to get 
an Asian-American history class taught at the college.&nbsp; The administration did 
not want the class.&nbsp; Asian-Americans petitioned for the class and eventually 
succeeded.&nbsp; It was left to Alan to find the professor and come up with the 
curriculum.&nbsp; Alan also wanted to integrate all minority history into the main 
history courses so all races would be educated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">23:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North Seattle 
Central Community College and Seattle Central Community College agreed to 
integrate the classes. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">23:52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan explains that 
there were no models for them to model their group after; they made it up on 
their own.&nbsp; They did have an advantage because of the African-American civil 
rights movement going on.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">24:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Oriental 
Student Union changed their name to the Asian Student Coalition.&nbsp; They created 
groups at all the high schools, colleges and universities they had 30 different 
groups.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">25:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan explains the 
choice to be known as Asian-Americans rather than one single race such as 
Chinese or Japanese; they would make a larger difference having larger numbers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">28:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Puyallup fair 
grounds were used as a holding camp, Camp Harmony.&nbsp; Alan’s parents were held at 
this camp. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">30:58&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan tells the 
story of the sit in he organized at the administration building of Seattle 
Central Community College.&nbsp; His group wanted an Asian-American to be hired as an 
administrator and the administration told them they weren’t qualified enough.&nbsp; 
It turned out that most that applied were qualified for the positions.&nbsp; The 
president of Seattle Central Community College said, “I’m not going to let you 
Asian-Americans sneak through the back door and get administrative jobs.”&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">35:20&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan and his 
supporters shut down the administration building at Seattle Central Community 
College in February of 1971.&nbsp; They forced all the administration out of the 
building.&nbsp; The demonstration received a lot of media coverage but the school 
would not change their minds about hiring an Asian-American.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">39:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March three weeks 
after the first demonstration Alan and his supporters held another in the 
administrative building.&nbsp; This time the police were more involved.&nbsp; Alan wanted 
a peaceful demonstration so to keep everyone busy he had him or her tape up 
yellow paper all over the building to get his or her point across.&nbsp; A lot more 
publicity came from this demonstration and more people in the Asian-American 
community began to support the movement. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">44:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The administration 
began pointing their finger at Alan, calling him a juvenile delinquent, because 
they thought he had not support from the community.&nbsp; Community members began to 
speak up and support him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">45:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The board of 
trustees as Seattle Central Community College wanted to make peace with Alan and 
agreed to hire an Asian-American administrator the following quarter.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">47:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seattle Central 
Community College asked Alan to leave because he had broken the rules.&nbsp; Alan 
then transferred to the University of Washington. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">48:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tensions at Seattle 
Central Community College between Asian-American and African-American groups 
grew because Asian-Americans did not want to support the African-American 
movement.&nbsp; They were trying to define their own identity and get their movement 
off the ground. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">51:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The University of 
Washington was behind in the Asian-American movement.&nbsp; They were still trying to 
create an ethnic studies program at UW; Alan used the tactics he learned at 
Seattle Central Community College to create an ethnic studies program at UW.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">52:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan tells how 
people never had an understanding of what Asian-American history was or even 
minority history.&nbsp; People would talk about either Asia or Africa when speaking 
of it.&nbsp; The history department at UW only offered European classes because they 
thought that was were everyone had came from.&nbsp; Alan didn’t come from Europe and 
many white students said the same thing.&nbsp; The teachers at UW were more 
closed-minded than those at Seattle Central Community College; it was more 
difficult to establish an ethnic studies program at the UW. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">54:55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan created the <i>
Asian Family Affair</i>, this newspaper focused on creating an identity for 
Asian-Americans.&nbsp; They were tired of the medias perspective coming from those 
not of Asian-American background and wanted to change what people thought of 
them.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.5in; margin-left: .5in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">57:00 &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Asian Family 
Affair</i> also wanted to get discriminatory movies, TV series and records off 
the air.&nbsp; </span></p>

with the construction of the Kingdome, the city government decided to place the 
Kingdome in the International District.&nbsp; This new construction would create a 
large housing shortage for low-income families because many of their homes would 
be torn down to build the dome.&nbsp; Asian-Americans wanted to fight the dome in the 
court but they lost.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.0in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:04:08&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
ground-breaking celebration for the Kingdome, Alan and a group of his friends 
decided to go down to the celebration and disrupt it; they wanted the city to 
know that the community did not agree with the construction of the dome.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.0in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:09:32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan and 
his supporters organized another demonstration called the March of HUD, because 
they were the ones holding all the money for low-income housing.&nbsp;&nbsp; All members 
of the community came out to support this demonstration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -1.0in; margin-left: 1.0in">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:10:35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Community Health Centers for low-income families were being created in other 
areas in Seattle; the International District felt they needed one.&nbsp; Alan went to 
John Spellman, county executive to ask for a health center.&nbsp; He agreed to fund 
the building of the first health clinic in the International District. </span>

Cities was another organization designed to provide low-income housing but they 
felt their main responsibility was to provide to the black community.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:14:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
International District preservation is something Alan is very proud of; he feels 
the International District is very unique because a lot of it is the original 
district.&nbsp; He and his friends were able to maintain a lot of the integrity of 
the district. </span></p>

Seattle’s chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) took on more 
leadership for the internment issues; Seattle was at the forefront to create 
reparations for the internees.&nbsp; This leadership was created by the student 
unions that wanted to lean more about their history.&nbsp; </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">1:21:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan 
feels that younger generations today are not familiar or appreciative of what 
they have today.&nbsp; Students to not understand or care about what it took to get 
the history put into the textbooks or what it took to get an Asian-American 
teacher or administrator hired in the 1970s.&nbsp; They do not realize the value of 
their history because they do not have to fight for it today like Asian-American 
students did in the 1960s and 1970s. </span></p>
