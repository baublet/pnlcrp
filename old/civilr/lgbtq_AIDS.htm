    <div class="arial10">
      <p>The City of Seattle&rsquo;s acceptance of gay men and lesbians as citizen-subjects played a significant part in the development of the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health&rsquo;s (SKCDPH) response to AIDS.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the AIDS Prevention Project (APP) was established in 1985, SKCDPH hired gay physician and former Northwest AIDS Foundation (NWAF) president Robert Wood to direct the project and longtime Seattle Gay Clinic volunteer and SKCDPH employee Tim Burak as project coordinator.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the early 1990s, the AIDS Prevention Project&rsquo;s community outreach had clearly made an impact on sexual decision-making and practices within the gay community as evidenced by this message produced on an APP flyer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;CONGRATULATIONS on being safe for almost a decade. Rates of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases in gay men have dropped dramatically since 1982.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a model of safety and caring for all other communities. So whether you&rsquo;ve chosen monogamy, safer sex, or abstinence, it&rsquo;s working.&nbsp;&nbsp;PLEASE Keep it up. Be safe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>SKCDPH&rsquo;s AIDS Prevention Project quickly evolved into a national model for responding the AIDS epidemic in large part as a result of the funding its staff was able to procure, and also in its forging of a public-private relationship reflective of an American welfare state supposedly in decline in the 1980s.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of factors contributed to making Seattle, King County, and Washington State&rsquo;s comprehensive response to AIDS possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the first diagnosis of AIDS in Seattle, the city had been a center of research in sexually transmitted diseases as a result of federal funding for research at the University of Washington and SKCDPH through the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA).<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When the CDC established a Demonstration Project for AIDS Prevention and Risk Reduction, SKCDPH was one of the original four sites chosen to receive CDC funding to experiment with effective responses to combat AIDS; therefore, SKCDPH received far more federal funding than the average municipal public health department prior to 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a &ldquo;second wave&rdquo; city, Seattle had the benefit of learning from the mistakes of the &ldquo;first wave&rdquo; cities of New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and the gay community and public health community had been intimately engaged with San Francisco&rsquo;s response to AIDS in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp;The political acceptance of the gay community in Seattle prior to AIDS also ensured that some gay community leaders had a voice in City Hall by the time of Seattle&rsquo;s first diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;SKCDPH STD Program Director Hunter Handsfield chose an HIV-positive gay man who had served as president of the Northwest AIDS Foundation as Director of the APP in Bob Wood, who in turn hired a gay SKCDPH employee Tim Burak as APP Coordinator.</p>
      <p>By the Fall of 1989, 55 percent of the APP&rsquo;s $7.7 million funding came from the federal government through the CDC Demonstration Project, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the US Conference of Mayors, 31 percent came from Washington State, which had passed the most comprehensive AIDS funding bill of any state in the country, 9 percent from private donors such as the Robert Wood Foundation, so only 5 percent of its funding came from Seattle and King County, and both municipal governments were highly supportive of effectively responding to AIDS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 60 percent of the APP&rsquo;s total funding was contracted out to community organizations, particularly for educational outreach to target specific communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the APP subcontracted educational outreach to the gay community to NWAF and subcontracted educational outreach to people of color to the People of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN).<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Ultimately, SKCDPH addressed AIDS as a public health crisis, not a crisis in gay sexuality.&nbsp;&nbsp;While Seattle was not immune to debates about bathhouses as sites of HIV transmission that dominated conversations about AIDS in mid-1980s San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, the point-of-view that sex panic would not achieve any lasting change and that safer sex techniques would need to promoted in a sex positive manner prevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The APP ultimately embraced the bathhouses as important sites of education, as bathhouse owners took a lead in distributing condoms and making safer sex literature available to their patrons.&nbsp;&nbsp;While Seattle&rsquo;s &ldquo;second wave&rdquo; status may have contributed to the decision to leave bathhouses open, the history of STD research and frank conversations about not only sex but same-sex sexual practices among medical researchers, a number of healthcare providers, and gay-identified Seattleites made SKCDPH more well-equipped than other public health departments to understand HIV transmission among gay men and treat gay men like adults capable of making their own sexual decisions.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>SKCDPH also addressed AIDS as a public health crisis by instituting a needle exchange program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tacoma had become the first American city to offer a needle exchange through its health department in 1988, and representatives of SKCDPH announced their endorsement of a needle exchange at SKCDPH in April 1989 to a meeting of the Seattle AIDS Network, which brought together public health officials and representatives of AIDS organizations across Seattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of a needle exchange, however, was pending approval from both the City of Seattle and King County since SKCDPH was a join city-county department.&nbsp;&nbsp;Activists from the Seattle chapter of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACTUP), including ACTUP Seattle co-founder Phil Bereano, thought they could speed up the city and county&rsquo;s approval of the needle exchange by taking the exchange into their own hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;By openly running an illegal needle exchange, ACTUP pressured the city and county to approve a more legitimate needle exchange through SKCDPH, which ultimately did speed up the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, SKCDPH hosts the largest needle exchange in the country, and HIV infection rates among intravenous drug users are far lower in King County than elsewhere in the United States as a result.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the recognition of communities of color as disproportionately affected by the AIDS crisis forced the APP to undo many of their assumptions about gay sexuality. Black and Latino men engaging in sex with other men were less likely to identify as gay than white men engaging in similar sexual behaviors, and some Native American men maintained culturally specific identities and thus did not identify with Euro-American gay or bisexual identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The APP began studying the new category &ldquo;men who have sex with men,&rdquo; correcting the assumption that gay and bisexual-identified men were the only men engaging in sexual behavior with other men, which was largely a by-product of the shared white, middle-class life experience of the APP&rsquo;s earliest employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;The APP began recruiting people of color to their staff, including Karen Hartfield of the Seattle Urban League, and subcontracted with the People of Color Against AIDS Network to produce educational materials and perform community outreach to communities of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the predominantly white gay community had largely bought into safer sex practices by the early 1990s, as the NWAF was an early subcontractor of the APP for community outreach, the APP&rsquo;s relationship with POCAAN developed over the late 1980s and new cases of HIV and AIDS were still climbing for communities of color.</p>
      <p>The politics of AIDS complicated liberalism within the gay community by pitting &ldquo;the public health&rdquo; against the right to privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Seattle&rsquo;s predominantly white, middle-class civil rights-oriented organizations, such as The Dorian Society, opposed HTLV-III (an early name for HIV) testing, which became available in 1985, given that no civil rights protections were in place for people living with AIDS or who tested positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The APP had to contend with this sentiment within the gay community by offering confidential testing, soon followed by anonymous testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The APP generally erred on the side of HIV status being relatively public to prevent the virus from spreading.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways, AIDS forced the publicity of gay sexuality, which prevailed over an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy.&nbsp;Furthermore, AIDS forced gay men to alter their sexual behavior in the interest of the entire community&rsquo;s health by practicing safer sex, thus most gay men conceded on the right to privacy at least with respect to interpersonal sexual decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1987, King County did add protections for HIV-positive individuals from discrimination, and Washington State included provisions to protect HIV-positive persons from discrimination when the legislature approved the AIDS Omnibus Bill in 1988, which became a model for AIDS legislation in other states across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;These protections from discrimination eased the tension between the APP and gay civil rights leaders over the issue of HIV status disclosure.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, SKCDPH&rsquo;s treatment of AIDS as a public health issue and not a crisis in sexuality combined with the APP&rsquo;s ability to acquire robust funding from private and federal sources made Seattle and King County a model for how to handle the AIDS epidemic at the municipal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;This spilled over into state politics when Washington&rsquo;s AIDS Omnibus Bill became a model for statewide approaches to combatting the epidemic.&nbsp;</p>
